            "Paragraph: August 8, 2016 | 1:22pm The former Vanderbilt quarterback is set to appear on the SEC Network as a college football analyst this season, and an ESPN executive says Rodgers earned the role on his talent alone. \"Our talent office had Jordan on their radar for some time. His name was in the initial group of names that we discussed when looking at people to bring to Charlotte [where the SEC Network is located] for auditions,\" Senior V.P. Stephanie Druley told SI.com . \"He played at Vanderbilt. He played quarterback. We had seen some interviews that he had done. So we reached out to him.\" Rodgers was unavailable for an audition at the time. Druley claims the network didn’t know what show he was shooting that kept him away, though ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney. When Aaron Rodgers’ youngest brother finally had his audition, he blew Druley away. \"It was clear he had a real passion and a deep knowledge of college football. The audition was really good — rare that someone walks in off the street and does an audition that we would be willing to air,\" she said. After Rodgers emerged as a front-runner on \"The Bachelorette,\" ESPN made him an offer a few weeks into the season. \"I had a real concern with how he would be viewed by fans of the show and what it might mean for him down the line,\" Druley said. \"He accepted the offer the day I was in an airport and saw Us Weekly with him splashed across the cover. Thankfully, the article didn’t live up to the headline, nor did a lot of the other ones I read.\" Rodgers talked about his professional endeavors during a conference call with reporters last week. \"I’ve been doing broadcasting for the past year — doing radio for ESPN and doing some TV stuff here and there — and I’ll be working with ESPN and SEC Network as a college football analyst,\" Rodgers said. \"That’s the conference I played in. That’s kind of my knowledge base.\"\n",

The Frontline documentary \"The Choice,\" which premiered this week on PBS, reveals that Trump agrees with the dangerous and abusive theory of eugenics Trump’s father instilled in him the idea that their family’s success was genetic, according to Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio. \"The family subscribes to a racehorse theory of human development,\" D’Antonio says in the documentary. \"They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.\" The Huffington Post dug back through the archives and found numerous examples of Trump suggesting that intellect and success are purely genetic qualities and that having \"the right genes\" gave him his \"very good brain.\"\n",

I certainly don’t sit on bar stools, pining,\" the 47-year-old told the paper. Plus, Anderson -- who will reprise her iconic role as Agent Dana Scully in Fox's new \"The X-Files\" revival later this month -- isn't willing to date just anyone. \"The thing is that there are needs and there are wants. I have a list of needs and I will not compromise about those,\" she said. \"But aside from that... I don’t meet anybody! It’s not like I meet people, and they ask me out, and I say no. It’s not even like I meet people and I don’t give them enough attention. I just don’t meet them at all. I’m either on a plane, or on set, or with my children.\" She's not averse to a blind date, though. \"There have been people in my life who’ve tried to set me up, and if a friend said, ‘I know someone amazing,’ I would show up,\" she said. \"But here’s the thing: I’ve got three children. It’s a big ask.\" (Story continues under the photo.) Gillian Anderson and her daughter Piper Maru Klotz walk the red carpet at the Lawrence Olivier Awards for theatre at the Royal Opera House last year. In an interview with The Telegraph back in March, Anderson joked that she's waiting for someone to be \"brave enough\" to ask her out. \"If it happens, it happens,\" she told the paper. \"What I am sure about is that I want my next relationship to be The One.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: The drug store chain Rite Aid will offer in-store assistance to people seeking to enroll in health insurance under President Barack Obama's health care reform law, the company announced Monday. Licensed insurance agents will be available at no cost in nearly 2,000 Rite Aid stores to provide answers to questions about Obamacare benefits and to help people apply for coverage and financial assistance or Medicaid coverage starting Oct. 1, when health insurance exchange marketplaces are scheduled to open for business across the country. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius joined Rite Aid CEO John Standley at a Monday news conference in Hoboken, N.J., to promote the initiative. The exchanges' six-month open enrollment period for 2014 health benefits begins in just 22 days, and polls persistently show the public to be uninformed and confused about the health care law. Amid a continuing political debate and efforts by the Obama administration and its allies to raise awareness of the law's benefits and responsibilities, pharmacy chains and other private health care companies are ramping up their own campaigns. \"Families throughout our country look to their pharmacy as a place they can go to for honest, straightforward advice they can trust,\" Sebelius wrote in a blog post published Monday. \"Since Americans trust their pharmacists for tell-it-like-it-is advice about their health, America’s pharmacies have a special role in these efforts. And it’s a role that Rite Aid and other pharmacies are embracing.\" CVS Caremark, the largest U.S. pharmacy chain, announced it also would provide health insurance enrollment help at its stores, and Walgreens has teamed up with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to promote Obamacare's benefits. Other drugstore companies including Winn-Dixie Pharmacy, Thrift White Pharmacy and BI-LO Pharmacy also will help customers learn about the law, Sebelius wrote. SoloHealth, with operates more than 3,200 digital health screening kiosks in Walmart, Sam's Club and Safeway stores, started including information about the law on its screens last week, the company announced Monday. Hospital chains, national physician groups and community health centers also are preparing to assist patients who may be buying health insurance coverage on the exchanges. Likewise, health insurance companies like Health Care Service Corp., which operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico and Oklahoma, are starting to get the word out that their products will be available on the exchanges. The White House is running a sweeping outreach and education campaign in the run-up to the enrollment period with a specific emphasis on low-income people, racial and ethnic minorities and young adults. The administration plans a $12 million advertising buy in 13 states where the federal government is operating the exchanges. States such as Minnesota and Oregon that are running their own health insurance exchanges are engaged locally and have begun mass marketing and advertising campaigns. Organizations like Enroll America are backing up these efforts with their own community-based activities. The Obama administration distributed grants to organizations hiring \"navigators\" to help people sign up for coverage last month.\n",

            "Paragraph: Zackery Michael/Abercrombie & Fitch Model Alex Libby was the face of a recent campaign. The foreign tourists who line up at Abercrombie & Fitch are increasingly nervous about spending money — and that could hurt the brand's turnaround. The euro's value against the dollar has declined steadily in recent years, which means that European tourists aren't shopping as much, Eric Beder, analyst at Wunderlich Securities, wrote in a recent note to clients. \" With [foreign exchange] still a key issue, and tourist traffic remaining a negative, we continue to be cautious on ANF and believe the company still faces a number of key issues in terms of fashion outlook, productivity and an overall weak teen segment to overcome before regaining anything similar to a premium multiple,\" Beder said. The tourist traffic is crucial — even if Abercrombie & Fitch is America's most hated retail brand , tourists appeared to love it. If they're abandoning Abercrombie & Fitch, that could only spell more trouble for the company. A few years ago, tourists were a big component to the company's success. The Wall Street Journal highlighted why, exactly, tourists would wait in line to enter New York City's flagship store. Reuters/Benoit Tessier Shoppers hold bags with clothing purchases on the opening day of operations by retailers Abercrombie & Fitch outside their Paris store on the Champs Elysees May 19, 2011. Beder is not convinced that the company is making a total comeback just yet. \"That said, we have seen the Street continue to accept virtually any level of mediocrity from the company as a 'come back;' we are not convinced, and remain on the sidelines,\" he wrote. retailer got the lowest score out of all specialty retailers on the American Consumer Satisfaction Index 's ranking.

Earlier this year, the \"I t was a reality check for us that we have a long way to go to really elevate the experience to be best in class,\" Chairman Arthur Martinez told Business Insider in March. But he said that \"when that survey is done again, we'll be much further up the charts.\" Dan Martensen/Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch brought in Neelam Gill for campaign last fall. Last quarter, the company posted its first positive quarter since 2012 — but it was largely thanks to Hollister, the company's better-performing younger surfer brother Beder believes that Hollister is still the brand that's leading the way. \"Expect Hollister to be the most advanced of the chains, while Abercrombie still remains very much a work in progress,\" Beder writes. \"We believe their still remains material work to do in terms of offering the right mix of fashion and logo product and finding the right pricing mix; we remain wary that the company has the right mix to register better returns and margins in the near term.\" The company releases its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 on Thursday.\n",

While the answer may be complicated for your favorite on-screen couple, Nora Ephron's 1989 hit is the perfect movie to curl up with while the leaves fall. Here's why: The movie poster pretty much says it all. But if you need more proof, watching their drive to New York in a yellow station wagon will make you nostalgic for the days of yesteryear.

            "Paragraph: After a long a long day of photosynthesizing, do trees fall asleep? It depends on how you define \"sleep,\" but trees do relax their branches at night, which might be a sign of snoozing, scientists said. In the only reported study to look at tree siestas, researchers set up lasers that measured the movements of two silver birch trees (Betula pendula) at night. One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?] The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said. The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found. Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. Credit: Eetu Puttonen \"Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,\" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. \"The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].\" It's unclear if the sun \"woke up\" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But \"the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],\" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science. The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said. The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep. However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said. The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said. \"Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,\" said study co-author András Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?] The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. \"This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,\" Puttonen said.\n",

            "Paragraph: As suspected, upcoming PlayStation 4 racing game Gran Turismo Sport will not offer dynamic time or weather. Series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explained to GT Planet that these options, which were key features in Polyphony's PlayStation 3 Gran Turismo games, were dropped in an effort to improve the game's overall presentation. Weather conditions and time of day will instead be pre-match options. \"We opted to not have the transitions in the race this time in order to raise the frame rate and the quality of the image during the race,\" he said. \"So the user will be able to set that before they enter the race. So you'll still be able to have night races, morning, races at dawn, dusk and so on.\" During the Gran Turismo Sport announcement event this month, Yamauchi suggested that the game would not feature dynamic weather. This appears to be the first time he's confirming that the game won't have dynamic weather or time. Sony Players may be happy to learn, however, that Gran Turismo Sport will have a damage system, even though it was not present in a recent demonstration of the game. Yamauchi has also identified 1080p and 60 frames per second as Polyphony's targets for the game Gran Turismo Sport marks the Gran Turismo series' debut on PS4. Originally announced late last year, we finally learned some hard details earlier this month. It'll include more than 130 cars and support for online and offline play, though its scope is more limited than the standard numbered releases. The planned beta is no longer happening, as Polyphony would prefer to spend its time focusing on Sport's launch this November.

We also always have some fresh lemons ready to be used. My wife really loves her freshly squeezed lemons and limes... Every once in a while my family has experimented with different kinds of milk like soy and almond milk. But after reading this information, I’m never going to have one of those ever again. And I felt compelled to share it with you. While many Americans are advised to consume these nut milks for their health, they’re actually critically misinformed. New evidence points to the fact that soy milk and soy products can seriously harm your health. Down below we’re sharing the top reasons you should stop drinking it. The least of all is thyroid cancer and Vitamin D deficiency... Do you drink soy milk? After reading this you’re going to toss it all into the trash! When buying products from the grocery store, the first place you should look, even before the price tag, is at the ingredients list. For soy milk, most products for sale include ingredients like: Natural Flavor, Soymilk (Filtered Water, Whole Soybeans), Calcium Carbonate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D2, Cane Sugar, Sea Salt, Carrageenan, Riboflavin (B2), as reported by Livingtraditionally.com. Does anything look fishy to you? If soy milk is supposed to be so healthy, why are they add injecting all these vitamin supplements? Yes, I thought that looked fishy too... Here are reasons you should stop consuming soy products like soy milk: 99% of soybeans are GMO. They are also the most highly pesticide-contaminated food Soybeans naturally contain haemagglutinin which naturally causes your blood to clot. Unless you’re anemic, soy milk may cause your blood to clot resulting to aneurysms Soy has long been known to contain plant estrogen or phytoestrogen. These immediate endocrine function, which is vital to good health, and may increase risk of breast cancer and infertility Soy foods are rich in aluminum. This toxic substance hurts your kidneys and your nervous system. It may be linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Soy beans are loaded with anti-nutrients or natural toxins. Just 2 glasses of soy milk per day can change a woman’s menstrual cycle. While transforming soy protein into textured vegetable protein and soy protein isolate, particles are exposed to high temperatures potentially making them carcinogenic. Soy hurts your body’s ability to properly process Vitamin D and Vitamin B12. Soy naturally contains toxic isoflavones which can trigger breast cancer growth. Because they’re high in phytic acid, soy products can inhibit your ability to process vital nutrients like calcium and magnesium. Be careful when consuming soy products.

Sander had served as the creative director of the brand since February 2012, when she replaced Raf Simons (who subsequently moved to Dior). At the time, she said, \"I am very happy and excited to be back.

She left her eponymous label in 2000, only to return again in 2003 then exit a second time in 2004. WWD reports that this time, Sander is leaving \"for personal reasons.\" Her departure will likely engender less frenzy and speculation than her return did in 2012, which coincided with Raf Simons' move to Dior (and an outpouring of industry emotion over the change). Now Raf is comfortably settled at Dior, and there seem to be few available creative director posts open, with the exception of Marc Jacob's recently vacated Louis Vuitton position.

            "Paragraph: Let's start by saying this: It is a looooong shot for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives this November. Democrats would need effectively run the table of competitive seats as judged by non-partisan political handicappers. But we'll also say this: What was once thought to be pretty much impossible could now be within the realm of possibility. And there could be a specific way to measure whether such a once-fanciful dream for Democrats could come true: The percentage of the vote the Democratic presidential nominee gets in November. For reasons we'll get into below, Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics think that number is 54 percent. And for reasons we'll get into below, that number's a long shot, too. It'd be the highest percentage a winning presidential candidate has received in two decades. Let's back up for a minute and explain why the House could be in play this November. It's all thanks to the guys Republicans appear to be on their way to nominating for president: either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Nonpartisan analysts who study this kind of thing for a living think either a Trump or Cruz nomination would be untenable for so many Americans that it could knock off Republicans further down the ticket -- perhaps enough to give Democrats the 30 seats they need to win the majority. (The current breakdown in the House is 246 Republicans to 188 Democrats.) The simplest explanation for that phenomenon is that people who come out to vote for the Democratic nominee are simply more likely than not to just check the ballot for Democrats all the way down. If enough Democrats come out and enough Republicans don't, lots and lots of Democrats win. [The top 10 House seats most likely to flip in 2016] So what is \"enough\"? Well, in 2012, President Obama won almost exactly 52 percent of the vote.* That, as you'll recall, was not enough of a wave to swing the House in his direction; Republicans picked up a net 13 seats. Using the 2012 election and its effect on down-ballot races as a baseline, Kondik and Skelley crunched the numbers and found that Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders) would have to get 54 percent of the vote in November to give Democrats a shot at winning the House. Such a high turnout on their side would essentially give Democrats a chance to net 35 House seats, which is five more than they need to get the majority. Upping Obama's victory by two points might sound relatively doable -- it's not 10 points, for example. But it's not all that easy, for a few reasons: Two points is a lot for a presidential candidate to scrape together in our highly polarized nation. As Kondik and Skelley point out, it's several points more than any presidential winner has gotten this century. Not since Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, won in 1996 with 54.7 percent of the vote has a candidate received 54 percent (even Obama's historic 2008 win earned him 53.7 percent). What's more, for the past seven presidential elections, neither candidate has gotten more than 55 percent of the vote. Clinton, who is the party's most likely nominee, doesn't seem to be the one to break that historical pattern. She's not well-liked in some critical swing states, like in Pennsylvania, where a recent Quinnipiac poll shows 59 percent of voters view her unfavorably, while just 35 percent view her favorably. In 2008, 65 percent of Pennsylvania voters liked Obama, according to a Marist poll taken a month before the election. It's just one state, but those numbers suggest Clinton has a lot of ground to make up -- and then some -- if she's going to win by more than Obama did in 2008. There's also early evidence that Republican voters who want an outsider for president (aka Trump and Cruz) are fine sending an incumbent back to Congress to work with him. So far, all incumbent Republicans who have been challenged by someone from their own party have won those primaries. And then there's the wildcard factor, which is that no one really knows what's going to happen this election. If you would have told us a year ago that we'd be writing a story about Democrats' potential for erasing Republicans' majority in the House, we'd probably laugh. As Republicans like to say, the last time their party held a bigger majority in the House, Babe Ruth was playing for the Yankees. It just didn't seem within Democrats' reach anytime this decade. But if there's one thing this election has taught us, it's that the old rules may no longer apply. And that's the biggest caveat of all. All of this is really an educated guess -- by very smart people, no doubt, but just a guess. We're trying to use the old rules to interpret the new. Which means seven months from now, we might be laughing at this article's predictions, too. *For the purpose of determining which party controls congressional seats, we and the University of Virginia are measuring all vote totals as between the two major parties. So among Democratic and Republican voters, Obama got almost 52 percent of the vote, and Hillary Clinton would have to get 54 percent of the two-party vote. The number changes when you add in non-major party voters, like independents, etc.\n",

            "Paragraph: The one thing any teen doesn’t want to have happen to them is rapid, unexplained weight gain. But Lizzie Denison-Ward, a now 20-year-old girl, had this happen to her for two years. She told the Daily Mail her story. She started gaining weight in November 2013. She couldn’t tell why, since she had always been slender. She went from 126 pounds to 224 pounds in two years. When she went to her doctor to try to find a reason she was gaining weight so rapidly, they told her that it was just her metabolism slowing down, and if she wanted it to come off she should eat less calories. So she did. But even eating 1000 calories per day, nothing changed. Not only that, but she experienced a rash on her face. She decided to do some private research. And when she paid for an MRI scan herself after doctors wouldn’t help her, she found that there was a 4 mm tumor in her brain. The tumor was on her pituitary gland, which was preventing her from losing weight. She had Cushing's disease. If left undetected, it could have killed her. By the time she had the MRI, she had gone up ten dress sizes. Lizzie finally had an answer to what was causing her unhealthy weight gain, but it wasn’t without psychological cost. \"I believed the doctors after I first saw them,\" said Lizzie, \"but over time I thought there was something else wrong because I’ve always been thin.\" Her mother worried about her too. She kept seeing her doctor, but to no avail. \"No one could get to the bottom of it and find out what it was. It was a real low time and I was feeling depressed.\" Now that she’s finally had it removed, she’s so glad to be rid of the problem. \"After I found out it was a tumor I was more relieved than anything. I was just glad I was right and I wasn’t just making it up.\" Five weeks later, Lizzie has already lost 21 pounds.

            "Topic: It’s a Long Shot, but Here’s How Trump Could Win\n",
            "Paragraph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump’s campaign. He’s made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There’s still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House—that he’s too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses. Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent. At least, that’s what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren’t. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn’t mean he couldn’t win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn’t too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions? At the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it’s possible that \"popularity\" just won’t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates’ worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump. Let’s say you don’t trust the models (they couldn’t predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat—let’s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively—and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn’t change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.) How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? He turns out white voters in historic numbers. It’s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan’s performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama. In other words, it’s not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it’s hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels—74 percent—then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It’s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it’s possible. OK, OK. \"Possible\" doesn’t mean \"likely,\" and it’s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney’s ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it’s a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won. It’s hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy’s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there’s a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump—his proximity to the most powerful office in the world—could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We’re due. One is all we need for President Trump. A terrorist attack could do it—driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race—but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders—and immigrants in particular—giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let’s table this one. There’s one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It’s why the \"Never Trump\" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it’s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton’s biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders’ backers who haven’t crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it’s dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won’t be. With all this said, even the most probable scenario here—that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates—is a distant long shot. They’re just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any Republican or any Democrat. And their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election—partisanship, demographics, and economic performance—to create favorable terrain for Democrats.\n",

But one research firm discovered what they're calling the world's ugliest color, which has been described as \"dirty\" and \"death.\" Pantone 448 C, or \"opaque couché\" is a greenish brown-gray that looks like it spent a few decades in a sewer. If you find it unpleasant, that's the point. The Australian government hired research agency GfK to redesign cigarette packaging in 2012, and they determined (with seven studies and 1,000 regular smokers) that this was the most deterring color to pair with the anti-smoking graphics. Other colors in the running were lime green, white, beige, dark gray, and mustard, with dark brown coming in second (but was deemed too chocolatey).\n",

            "Paragraph: No matter how steadfast the resolve, even the strictest dieters will crave naughty treats from time to time. But according to a registered nutritionist, you can eat (and drink) to beat the cravings to make sure you stick to you January diet plan. From sipping vinegar, drinking ginger tea and even eating a few squares of (dark) chocolate, these are the foods and drinks that will curb those hunger pangs and cure you of your desperation for a bag of crisps or a sweet treat, according to Rhiannon Lambert. 1. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR 'Studies suggest that this vinegar can reduce blood sugar levels, preventing sugar cravings,' says Rhiannon. 'Adding vinegar to meals high in carbohydrates can increase feelings of fullness, making people eat 200-275 fewer calories for the rest of the day. 'A study in obese individuals showed that daily vinegar consumption led to reduced belly fat, waist circumference, lower blood triglycerides and weight loss.' Warning: don't drink it neat. It's best to add this vinegar to meals or heavily dilute it with water before you sip it. 2. EGGS 'Adding more protein to your diet can increase the feeling of fullness,' says Rhiannon. 'In fact, studies suggest you eat less at your next meal, and cravings are kept at bay. 'One weight loss study compared two breakfasts identical in calories: the first had an egg based start to the day and the second had bagels. The participants who had the egg breakfast lost 65 per cent more weight and 16 per cent more body fat over the eight-week study period.' 3. DARK CHOCOLATE  'One 2011 study found that the bitterness of dark chocolate helps decrease your appetite and diminish cravings for sweets. 'Try and opt for 85 per cent dark chocolate.' 4. WHOLEGRAINS 'A high fibre intake stretches the stomach, slows its emptying rate, and influences the release of fullness hormones. 'Fibre-rich whole grains can also help reduce hunger and keep you feeling full. 'Try and opt for wholegrain breads, brown rice, brown rice and grains such as quinoa as a base to any meal.' 5. CHICKPEAS 'They are a source of vegetarian protein and again, they're rich in fibre,' comments Rhiannon. 'Recent studies suggest that by adding fibre-rich beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils to your meal, you can increase feelings of fullness by as much as 31 per cent, compared to equivalent meals that aren’t based on beans. 'Try snacking on hummus and crudités at work.' 6. GINGER 'Ginger is known for its many health benefits including reducing nausea, inflammation and muscle pain, but some studies suggest it can reduce hunger too. 'Try a ginger tea after dinner for multiple benefits.' 7. OATS 'Oats are a good source of fibre and protein, which is broken down slowly, keeping you feeling full for longer. 'The fibre in oats known as beta-glucans thicken in water, forming a gel-like substance that sits in the gut, reducing any hunger pangs.'  8. MACKEREL 'Omega-3 fats, particularly those found in fish and algae oils, have the ability to increase levels of the fullness hormone leptin. 'Salmon isn’t the only fish containing omega-3. Try mackerel for a change at breakfast or tuck into some tuna steak at dinner.' 9. WATER 'When your body loses too many fluids, you can become dehydrated. 'Unfortunately too many of us are not drinking enough water on a day-to-day basis and we often confuse thirst with food cravings. 'If you feel the urge to grab a specific item of food, try drinking a glass of water and wait a few minutes. 'You may find that the craving fades away, as you were just thirsty. In fact, recent research has reported that people who drink two glasses of water immediately before a meal eat 22 per cent less than those who don’t drink any water.' 10. YOGHURT 'High protein snacks are great for curbing cravings as they do not affect blood sugar levels. 'This means steady blood sugar levels, and that cravings are kept away. 'Greek yoghurt in particular is a great option and has been shown to decrease hunger more effectively than high-fat crackers or a high-fat chocolate snack.'\n",

            "Topic: If you leave your kids alone, it’s not predatory strangers who are a risk\n",
            "Paragraph: Once, when she was in about the first grade, she even found a snake. \"There’s no way I would have picked up a snake in front of my parents,\" she says. \"The reason I knew it was OK was I had also gone by myself to the library to take a snake safety class.\" (Yes, a snake safety class.) \"You can pretend you’re the Queen of Sheba,\" she says. Playing on her own let her imagination soar. As a child, Ashley Thomas loved to go, by herself, to a meadow about a 10-minute walk from her house in Ojai, California. Ah, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services! Only in the past decade or so has \"no child left alone\" become the social and legal norm in the U.S. A doctoral student in cognitive science at the University of California at Irvine, Thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what’s going on. After all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low. The chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually. It’s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere, or even to walk with one across a parking lot, than to leave a kid alone in a well-ventilated car. News reports and crime shows feed exaggerated fears. Thomas and her co-authors note that legal norms needn’t follow inaccurate beliefs about risks. \"The fact that many people irrationally fear air travel does not result in air travel being criminalized,\" they write. \"Parents are not arrested for bringing their children with them on airplanes. \"In contrast, parents are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their children to wait in cars, play in parks, or walk through their neighbourhoods without an adult,\" they note. Indeed, parents safely make decisions every day without thinking about other tiny risks. \"When you decide to park your car in a parking lot you don’t look up at the roof to see if a sniper could hit you,\" Thomas says. You don’t think about whether the store you’re taking your child into might get held up. Nor should you. Yet leaving your kid alone, even for a short time in safe circumstances, can lead to a child-abuse investigation. What’s going on? The researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting. To separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1⁄2-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching Frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes. The reasons for the parent’s absence were varied randomly. It could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover. Because the child’s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical. Asked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident. The unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn’t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade. But survey respondents didn’t see things this way at all. \"A mother’s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother’s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother’s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair,\" they write. The same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally. Moral disapproval informed beliefs about risks. That was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical/immoral). People rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment. \"People don’t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral,\" the researchers write. \"They also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous. \"That is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so.\" The result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse. These beliefs don’t just affect busybodies. They lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks. Take what happened to Julie Koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an Evanston, Illinois, Starbucks for three minutes. When she saw a police officer talking to the girls through the open windows, she thought nothing of it, until he returned and her 8-year-old started crying. She rushed out of the store, and the situation deteriorated from there. Koehler is a public defender in the homicide division. She knew she hadn’t broken any laws and she had two lawyers, her husband and mother, to call to the scene. She wasn’t arrested, but the state nonetheless initiated a child-abuse investigation. Officials interrogated the kids, required a pediatrician’s exam, demanded that Koehler supply two references, and questioned them and her about her mental health, including whether she was on any medications. \"What if I was taking an anti-depressant? Would that have affected the outcome of the case?\" she asks. The investigation determined that the report of abuse was \"unfounded.\" But it taught Koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances. The real stranger danger doesn’t come from would-be kidnappers. It comes from people who think they’re doing good.\n",

            "Paragraph: On Thursday, Amazon announced that the annual price of Amazon Prime, a service which gives members free two-day shipping on millions of eligible items, will increase from $79 to $99. The discounted fee of students will be going from $39 to $49. It's the first time Amazon has increased the annual fee on its popular membership program in its nine-year existence. In addition to free shipping on some items, Prime customers get access to Amazon's library of more than 40,000 streaming movies and television shows and to Amazon's Kindle Owner's Lending Library of books to read. Though Amazon has refused to divulge the exact number of people it's enrolled in Prime, in December it said it was in the \"tens of millions,\" meaning that $20 price bump will give Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue. \"Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the price of Prime has remained the same,\" Amazon told The Huffington Post by email. \"If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today.\" Amazon sent a similar statement to some Prime customers to justify the increase. Current Amazon Prime members will pay the increased fee when they renew, starting on April 17. Any new customer who signs up starting March 20 will also pay $99. The good news, at least for those without Prime yet, is that the $79 price will be available for the next week for new customers. It shouldn't come as a big surprise that Amazon's prices are going up. Tom Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, announced on a call with investors and analysts in January that the company was \"considering\" a price increase for Prime members.\n",

The 29-year-old attended the wedding of his cousin, Alexander Fellowes, and Alexandra Finlay at the Palace of Westminster today, looking dapper in a sleek suit and pink tie (perhaps he took our style advice?). Though we certainly missed Cressida Bonas, Harry's MIA \"girlfriend,\" we did notice another blonde by the royal's side: his cousin Celia Mccorquodale. Ms. Mccorquodale, Princess Diana's 22-year-old niece, has a bit of a party girl reputation, not unlike her redheaded cousin. For the affair, Celia opted for a short floral print dress and cream blazer (very Princess Beatrice).

            "Topic: Driving Home After A Night Shift Is Way More Scary Than You Thought\n",
            "Paragraph: The drive home after a night shift can be hazardous too, confirms a small but compelling new study involving a global team of researchers from Boston and Australia. They conducted daytime driving tests on a closed driving track among 16 night shift workers who had just come off the job. The study found that the volunteers' driving was dangerously worse after work than if they'd had a full night's sleep. Six of the participants (37.5 percent) had 11 near-crashes during the driving test, which required the safety supervisors to use their emergency brakes to prevent a collision. The researchers terminated the two-hour driving test early for seven participants (43.8 percent) over concerns for the safety of everyone in the car. Based on the numbers, the researchers suggest that the night shift workers and their employers find a way for workers to get home that doesn’t involve getting into the driver’s seat of a car, or come up with strategies to reduce drowsiness after a shift. \"These findings help to explain why night shift workers have so many more motor vehicle crashes than day workers, particularly during the commute home,\" said study co-author Dr. Charles A. Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in a statement. The study is the first time researchers have assessed the impact of night shift work on driving in real vehicles, as opposed to using a simulated method. After sleeping almost eight hours the night before with no shift work, the 16 participants had zero near-crashes -- and all finished the agreed-upon two-hour driving test. But when participants went through the same test after a night shift (at this point, it had been an average of 13 hours since their last sleep), there was a statistically significant increase in lane drifting, slow eye movements and \"microsleep episodes\" -- temporary shut-eye that last more than three seconds. All of the near crashes occurred after at least 45 minutes into the driving test. About 15 percent of workers in the U.S. drive more than 45 minutes each way of their commute, the study notes. The researchers wrote that the safety supervisors who accompanied participants on these driving tests could tell that the workers were drowsy and impaired within the first 15 minutes of the drive. The experiment, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted on a driving track that belongs to vehicle insurer Liberty Mutual Insurance. In an emailed statement to The Huffington Post, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety said that they hope \"a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in drowsy driving can lead to effective prevention strategies that would help alleviate this major public health concern.\" There are several limitations of the study. One in particular is that the driving tests took place on a closed driving track with a simple design relative to real streets. Even though this means the participants were driving real cars, they were not encountering real-life commuting challenges like the behavior of other cars, pedestrian traffic and complex road navigation. The additional challenges of a real commute may actually serve to enhance wakefulness in drivers, as the higher stakes might force them to be more alert, the researchers note. The study's observation methods -- like having to stop the driving test every 15 minutes to survey the driving participants, asking the drivers to attach EEG electrodes to their heads to measure the microsleep episodes and making them wear special glasses to measure the speed of their eye movements and how long they blinked -- may have artificially made the participants more alert than they’d normally be on a real drive home. Yet, Czeisler points out, all these conditions, the monitoring measures and added social pressure, couldn’t keep about 44 percent of participants alert enough to complete the driving test. \"This was real driving in an actual car, putting everyone involved in the experiment at considerable risk,\" he said. \"And yet the impairment still came through, which shows just how strong the biological drive for sleep is.\" The responsibility is on everyone -- from the shift workers to companies and all the way up to public officials -- to work on countermeasures to combat the dangers of drowsy driving, Czeisler said. For instance, while drinking coffee can help keep night shift workers awake on their commute home, it’s no solution to drowsy driving, and it may make matters worse for night shift workers in the long run, Czeisler explained. \"Yes, caffeine will help, but there’s no silver bullet here that will solve the problem because what tends to happen is that people drink caffeine and then push themselves harder,\" he said. \"The other problem with caffeine is that it interferes with daytime sleep, and [night shift workers] have enough trouble sleeping during the daytime in between shifts -- let alone if they’re drinking caffeine right before going to bed.\" Instead of relying on caffeine, night shift workers should invest in blackout shades and other tools to help them sleep during the daytime, in between shifts, Czeisler said. And if banking a normal amount of sleep during the daytime isn’t helping, consider going to the doctor, Czeisler suggested, who may diagnose shift work disorder and prescribe medication to help keep you awake on a long drive home. Companies have a responsibility as well to guard against drowsy driving, Czeisler continued. \"Let’s say there's a factory one hour away from a major city,\" he said. \"Presuming people are going to drive that distance, [the company] should hire a shuttle service, at the very least to bring people to a major city where they can get public transportation to their homes.\" Drowsy driving is a serious problem in the U.S. About four percent of Americans report that they’ve fallen asleep while driving , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that driving while sleepy was a factor in 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries and 800 deaths in 2013. These numbers are likely an underestimate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those most at risk of drowsy driving are shift workers, commercial truck and bus drivers, people with untreated sleep disorders or who take sleep medications and anyone who simply doesn't get enough sleep, according to the CDC. If you’ve missed your exit, find yourself drifting across lanes or hit a rumble strip (bumps on the side of the road meant to jolt you awake), pull over immediately to sleep or change drivers, the public health institute advises. Blasting the radio or rolling down the windows do not help keep you awake, authorities warn. \"You might say, well there’s no other way I can get home from work,\" Czeisler said. \"But if you realized that you might actually die or kill somebody, maybe you’d come up with another alternative.\"\n",

            "Topic: 'Simpsons' Star Finally Debunks That Popular Fan Theory About Bart\n",
            "Paragraph: On the very first day of this year, Jan. 1, 2016, a new \"Simpsons\" fan theory emerged that quickly inspired a viral amount of yellow journalism. As the theory goes, famously cranky bartender Moe Szyslak has actually known all along that Bart Simpson is the notorious prank-caller that’s been bothering his bar since the very first season of the show in 1990. The Reddit user that proposed the theory, Senor_Schnarf, argued that Szyslak is simply a family friend of the Simpsons and goes along with Bart’s pranks given he’s a lonely man who enjoys making the kid happy. The most compelling evidence is that Bart’s phone calls to the bar are typically in the same exact voice ― every time ― and follow a beyond obvious joke structure. Szyslak also always goes out of his way to make the joke land. As an example, in the Season 1 episode \"Some Enchanted Evening,\" Bart calls Moe’s bar and asks, \"Hello, is Al there? ... Al. Last name: Coholic.\" In that call, Moe could simply ask if there’s a Mr. Coholic or an Al, but instead yells, \"Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Is there an Al Coholic here?\" The running joke of Bart pranking Moe is one of the show’s most iconic bits. If this theory is true, you would definitely need to go back and re-watch all 27 seasons with the correct interpretations of the two characters to get an accurate understanding of the show. That would take a long time! So with the opportunity to interview Hank Azaria ―the voice actor behind Moe since Season 1 ― about his recent Emmy nomination for a guest-starring role in \"Ray Donovan,\" The Huffington Post had to also ask how he felt about the fan theory surrounding his character and Bart. Well, Azaria doesn’t believe the theory. \"The Simpsons\" Azaria, who voices more characters on \"The Simpsons\" than any other actor, first reacted to the fan theory by laughing. Then he said, \"Uhh, that’s absurd. I never heard that before.\" Not an auspicious start for the theory, but Azaria did do a minor backpedal and said, \"Wait, now that I’m thinking about it, he did sort of take a shine to Maggie. And he has often sort of ... \" Azaria then paused what little credence he was affording the theory and continued, \"But no ... I think Moe kind of is what he is. He hates pretty much everyone and has no patience for children.\" The voice actor went on to explain that Moe \"is not the brightest bulb in the box\" and summed up by saying, \"that’s really all the explanation you need,\" before laughing again. To get a final nail to the theory’s coffin, HuffPost pressed on whether Azaria was definitely saying Bart has successfully been tricking Moe this whole time like the show makes it seem on the surface. \"Oh, yeah, I would say for sure,\" said Azaria. \"That’s how I’ve been playing it.\" Watch Bart’s prank calls on Moe from over the years:\n",

            "Topic: Tom Hanks' Riveting Performance Makes 'Captain Phillips' One Of Year's Best So Far\n",
            "Paragraph: Tom Hanks has the scene in \"Captain Phillips,\" a moment that will play during the Academy Awards when Jennifer Lawrence announces Hanks as a Best Actor nominee on March 2, 2014. That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances. \"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\" The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins. This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way. That, however, is back-room chatter for another day. For now, just know that \"Captain Phillips\" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. It's riveting filmmaking. \"Captain Phillips\" opens on Oct. 11.\n",

            "Paragraph: One day after moving the release of \"Ant-Man\" to July 31, 2015, Walt Disney Studios has shifted \"Pirates of the Caribbean 5\" from July 10, 2015 to an unspecified date in 2016. The studio made the announcement via press release on Tuesday, but THR had more on the move: Script issues are said to be the cause of the delay, though the move comes in the aftermath of 'The Lone Ranger's' failure at the box office this summer. That's not the official line from Disney, as the studio insiders told Deadline.com that the film's script was still being worked on and that the move was not cause for alarm. Prior to the \"Pirates 5\" shift, it was speculated that Disney could move \"Star Wars: Episode VII\" out of summer 2015 because of an already overcrowded calendar that also includes \"Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" Pixar's \"Inside Out\" and Marvel's \"Ant-Man.\" All three of those films will arrive in theaters between May and July. (Whether \"Star Wars\" eventually moves to December of that year is still unconfirmed.) Despite the date change, Johnny Depp is still locked in to return to the franchise for a fifth time.

            "Paragraph: Congratulations. From this day forward, you will no longer squander your time trying to work out the perfect regex to validate email addresses. You will also never again run the risk of rejecting what is, in fact, a strange, valid email address. The trick is to first define what we mean by ‘valid’. We are developers, we are technical folk, so it’s no surprise that the prevailing wisdom is to check that it matches the official criteria, some examples of the diversity of the official criteria are... But I say pish! to prevailing wisdom, so... Everything you know is wrong Instead of the above approach that largely ignores reality, I believe there are two questions we need to ask: Did the user understand that they were supposed to type an email address into this field? Did the user correctly type their email address into this field? If you have a well laid-out form with a label that says \"email\", and the user enters an ‘@’ symbol somewhere, then it’s safe to say they understood that they were supposed to be entering an email address. Easy. Next, we want to do some validation to ascertain if they correctly entered their email address. Not possible. It’s important that you agree with me on this point: it’s not possible. I know what you’re thinking. \"But it helps, right?\" That’s like saying that opening and closing your fridge really quickly conserves energy and helps fight climate change. Sure, it helps, if we want to be slaves to the word ‘help’. But most people would agree you have a promising career in a straight jacket if you’re unnecessarily rattling your pickle jars for the benefit of the polar bears. Let’s explore Let’s imagine that my email address is davidgilbertson@example.com. That’s 27 stabs at the keyboard that could go awry. Any mistype will definitely result in an incorrect email address but only maybe result in an invalid email address. Even if the sun shone through my window and I was visited by a particularly savage sneeze (I suffer from Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst Syndrome*) and I typed out #!$%&’*+-/=?^_`{}|~@example.com by mistake, I would still pass the most thorough email ‘validation’ techniques. (The flip side is I fail and be told my address isn’t valid when it is! On a whim I just emailed the person at #!$%&’*+-/=?^_`{}|~@example.com and she said she gets super pissed off when told that her email address isn’t valid. She regrets buying the example.com domain, too, but won’t give it up, just like the guy that’s got milk.com. We got chatting and it turns out she only lives a few blocks from me and also collects vintage cameras we’re playing golf next week. I think maybe she’s the one. I should probably close these brackets and get on with the story.) So what are the odds that any one typo would result in an invalid email address? We will build a statistical model! Let’s look at, say, the ‘g’. I am more likely to mis-type with a letter on the visible keyboard with no shift key required (I apply a weighting to non-modified keys in the model). From all of the tappable keys on a physical keyboard, there are six characters that, while not completely invalid, are only valid in certain cases: []\\, and space. 6 out of 48. A 12% chance. But an off-by-one error is more likely. For example hitting the neighbouring ‘h’ key instead of ‘g’. So from a list of 117 million email addresses I have calculated the frequency of occurrence of each character and for each, noted which keys lie closest on the keyboard, and factored in the likelihood that a mis-stroke will create an invalid email address. (I know hacking LinkedIn just to make a point about email validation is a bit extreme, but it is important to back up one’s opinions with data). For example, ‘e’ is considered a low risk of invalidating, because all surrounding keys would still result in a valid email address. But ‘p’ has [ and  within striking distance! So although it’s less common than ‘e’, it carries a higher risk of resulting in an invalid email address if missed. I also consider the relative dexterity of the fingers. We all know that the pinky is the retarded cousin of the finger family, so that is factored in as well. Now, let’s say Silkie (fox) sits on the shift key and I hit the wrong key on the keyboard. I’m in danger of getting one of 6 bad keys: @:\"<> and space. And again, those bad keys are only invalid in certain circumstances. And since it’s more likely that the shift key would be down only for the letters on either side of the @ symbol, and ‘l’ on either side of the @ is considered particularly dangerous. The above is all for a single key, but if I mistype a second key, it is possible that I turn an invalid email address back into a valid one (e.g. adding a \\ next to a \\). This is, of course, factored into the model. It goes without saying that I’ve gone to a similar level of effort to account for soft keyboards. Remember too that if I mistype the @ symbol, the error will be caught by step one above where I actually check for the existence of an @ as a proxy for a user’s intent to enter an email address. I also built in some general common sense: people with aol email addresses are sloppy typers. Daryls tend to poke at the keys with only their index fingers like they’re afraid each key will burn them. People with ‘z’ in their name use mechanical keyboards and rarely make mistakes. Your basic human axioms. I also factored in the fact that any dot before the @ in gmail addresses is ignored and that ‘f’ and ‘h’ are pretty much the same letter when you think about it. The result So with all of that taken into account, I ran the 117 million email addresses through the model. And the odds that an incorrect email address will be caught by email validation is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000625% I’m afraid I don’t have time to type out the algorithm that totally exists and is indisputably perfect, so you’ll have to take my word for it that this number is not in any way made up. The upshot There is no point in trying to work out if an email address is ‘valid’. A user is far more likely to enter a wrong and valid email address than they are to enter an invalid one. Therefore, you are better off spending your time doing literally any other thing than trying to validate email addresses. The 100% correct way Send your users an activation email. (That’s a bold full-stop for effect.)\n",

            "Paragraph: Verizon and AT&T Don't Like This Internet Ruling, But Your Pocketbook Will A seemingly obscure legal decision was reached this week, but it affects our use and enjoyment of the Internet, and ensures that we won't be charged more for it. The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality. Net neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It’s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It’s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined. But for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. They've wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay. It was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay. Three years ago when these rules were being formulated by the FCC, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. Four million citizens emailed and called the FCC objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. When comedian John Oliver explained on HBO’s \"Last Week Tonight\" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes. Opposition also came from the major technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix. The Internet Association , the organization representing nearly 40 tech companies, including those above, also filed a formal petition in opposition. They want companies to compete by being able to attract customers based on their products and services, not on speed of access.

In a text message to BusinessWorld, incumbent NCCA chairman Felipe de Leon Jr stated that \"the position of NCCA chairman is not appointive, according to Republic Act 7356.

            "Topic: China is too quick to rebalance its services sector\n",
            "Paragraph: Reuters For years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project. That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector. That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers. But what if we've got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\" From the note (emphasis added): \"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies. \"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries. \"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\" Work, work, work, work, work What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter. HSBC Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt. China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam. That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors. So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of. The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry. During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output. So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down. The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term. From the note (emphasis added): \"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\" HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety.

            "Topic: iPhone Fix Issued After Hacking Attempt on Political Dissident\n",
            "Paragraph: An Apple iPhone Photograph by Justin Sullivan — Getty Images Especially if you have something to hide. Apple issued a patch Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident’s phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking. The thwarted attack on the human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, used a text message that invited him to click on a web link. Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings Thursday. \"Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,\" Citizen Lab wrote in a report released Thursday. ( AAPL -0.43% ) The researchers said they had alerted Applea week and a half ago, and the company developed a fix and distributed it as an automatic update to iPhone 6 owners. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz confirmed that the company had issued the patch after being contacted by researchers. The Citizen Lab team attributed the attack software to a private seller of monitoring systems, NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes software for governments which can secretly target mobile phones and gather information. Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million. NSO chief executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company \"cannot confirm the specific cases\" covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports. Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software. \"The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products only be used in a lawful manner,\" he added. \"Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.\" Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries. Low Profile NSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners. That company’s chief executive, Dipanjan Deb, did not return a call Thursday. In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself \"Q\" and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion. Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools. NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about \"what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE.\" The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment. NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective. Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government. Others Targeted It also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations. A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned. The market for \"lawful intercept,\" or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims. Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers. Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab. \"I can’t think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor,\" said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton.\n",

            "Paragraph: Multiple shark tanks, a personal grotto and a half-million dollar drop in price will make this someone's dream house. Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas, whose shoe-pooping incident is not the most colorful event in his past, left the D.C. area at the end of 2010. His idiosyncratic 9,000-square-foot Northern Virginia home, however -- heavy on the shark tanks, and also featuring an outdoor pool, seven bedrooms, 10 baths, that personal grotto and then some more shark tanks -- remains. The house, located at 10919 Georgetown Pike, Great Falls, Va., went on the market in June 2012 for $3.5 million, but was taken off some six months later. It was re-listed this July for same price; then $250,000 was shaved off in August. Another $252,000 came off at the beginning of September. And, hey, if you do buy this big house, that extra $500,000 might come in handy. Arenas, now playing ball in China (working, fittingly, for the Shanghai Sharks), once said that feeding the sharks kept in the tanks costs some $5,000 per month.\n",

            "Paragraph: The condition is just one of a range of bizarre restrictions in the network’s rules You’ve probably broken the rules of just about every app you use. If you’ve changed your phone number and not immediately told Facebook, you’re infringing the site’s terms of service. Facebook’s \"statement of rights and responsibilities\" requires its users to tell it of any change within 48 hours, as pointed out by The Guardian. It is one of a range of restrictive rules that every person using Facebook has signed up to – whether they actually read them or not. They also include rules that force people not to use any fake information or to have more than one account. Snapchat also forces people to tell it as soon as they change their number, despite a phone number not being anything like a central part of the app. It does give its users slightly longer to do so, requiring it in the first 72 hours of any alteration. While the restriction is likely intended as a way of ensuring that its records on people are up to date and that it can contact them immediately, phones numbers are also valuable information. They help track people around the internet as well as ensuring that people are signing up with their real personal information, which in turn makes the data collected far more valuable. Similar rules are imposed on much of other people’s personal information. Just about every app – including both Snapchat and Facebook – have a clause making clear that it can use any public posts in any way it wants. Snapchat specifically says that it can \"host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish and distribute\" content made on the service – whether it is public or not – and makes allowances for screening and looking at snaps even thought they might appear to be very private. Most apps – including other like Instagram – have some version of the same terms, which tend to include many of the same words.\n",

            "Paragraph: There is already a substantial list of Republicans who would rather stay home on Election Day, or even vote for Hillary Clinton, than cast their ballot for Donald Trump. Some are saying that Laura Bush can now be counted in that category. When the former First Lady, and wife of George W. Bush, appeared at last week's Women in the World summit, she outlined the qualities she thinks make a good presidential candidate. \"I want our next president—whoever he or she might be—to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue U.S. policies,\" Bush said. She added that the candidate should \"pay attention to our history, and know what's happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.\" Though she was careful not to name names, some news outlets, including the Telegraph , have speculated that she was referring to Hillary Clinton who worked to improve lives of women in developing countries during her time as Secretary and State. Clinton also wrote a cover endorsement for We Are Afghan Women: Voices of Hope , Bush's recently published book. The U.S. has a tendency \"to become sort of isolationist and xenophobic,\" Bush continued. \"I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.\" Again the former First Lady did not specify any candidate. However, it's easy to interpret this as a criticism of Trump. His comments about Mexicans and Muslims have been deemed by many as isolationist and xenophobic , and he has been accused of exploiting voters' anger and frustration to rise to the rank of frontrunner. A spokesperson for the former First Family denied speculation that Bush was supporting Clinton, telling CBS , \"They are definitely trying to make this into something it isn’t.\"\n",

            "Topic: Waiter-less, cashier-less restaurant is the stuff of the future\n",
            "Paragraph: We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa. Eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience. The tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots. Instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse?  The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about. While one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\" Much like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor — our mascots, we call them — and we’re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls. To the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap.  Since there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth. Right before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice. TBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons. The process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised. Though I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen. Very ominous. Despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There’s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\" First-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it’s fun that there’s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\" As of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend — that’s how we make it so fast and so quick.\" With the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal. While this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it’s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone’s like woah this is crazy. So it’s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\"  Bryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said. Her boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It’s almost like a robot’s making it anyways.\" To get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We’re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\" Nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned.  Marsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said.  Though the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.) \"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we’ve only been open for two days. We’ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said. What's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there.\n",

            "Paragraph: Rumors about his retirement have been swirling for months, and the time may be close at hand for Allen Iverson to officially hang up his NBA jersey. Citing sources familiar with Iverson's retirement plans, ESPN reports that the 11-time NBA All-Star and former Rookie of the Year will formally retire from the league at the Philadelphia 76ers' home opener against the Miami Heat on Oct. 30. Iverson, 38, hasn't played in the NBA since February 2010, when he was on the 76ers roster. But the 6-foot dynamo has said time and again that he hoped to return to the league before his retirement. The former MVP, who played 10 games for Turkish professional basketball team Besiktas in 2011 and took part in an exhibition tour in China in 2012, told his Twitter followers in January that he hoped to \"complete [his] legacy in the NBA.\" I realize my actions contributed to my early departure from the NBA, should God provide me another opportunity I will give it my all — Allen Iverson (@alleniverson) January 29, 2013 My dream has always been to complete my legacy in the NBA — Allen Iverson (@alleniverson) January 29, 2013 Despite his optimism, Iverson -- whose off-court troubles have drawn more attention in recent years than his basketball talents -- has been realistic about his NBA hopes. During an interview with CSN Philly in March, he said: At some point it comes to an end regardless, however it comes, whether it is retirement or injury, at some point it comes to an end. I am happy and content with everything that has gone on in my life and I am just looking for the next phase, and if I get a chance to play again I would love the opportunity, but if not I will continue to just be happy. Iverson leaves behind an impressive NBA legacy. A four-time scoring champion, he notched so many career points per game that only Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West have outscored him, per ESPN.\n",

            "Paragraph: The hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for Earthbound folk. (ESA/NASA) When you sit around imagining life aboard the International Space Station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don’t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel. And you almost certainly don’t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft’s window with it. Especially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of Earth. [NASA reminds us that astronaut poop burns up ‘like shooting stars’] But that’s exactly what happened last month in the space station’s Cupola, a European-built 2010 addition that you’re sure to recognize — it’s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken. \"I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris,\" British astronaut Tim Peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement. \"Yes — this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!\" Um, yeah. You can say that again. NASA released an animation depicting space trash in motion around Earth. (YouTube/NASA) The astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe — they generally don’t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises. And the views are safe, too — the chip is less than a centimeter across. According to the European Space Agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across. A FLAKE OF PAINT. Let that sink in. Because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. Debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. In 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting Earth. The danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film \"Gravity,\" in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk. Space junk is definitely a real concern. Mashable reports that NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of. These days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that’s already there.\n",

We then saw her have her first sonogram with Ross and her lover Susan at her side, giving viewers a glimpse at what would turn out to be Ross' son Ben. But that was all we saw of her. When next we saw Carol, in The One Where Underdog Gets Away, she was not only bigger from being several months pregnant, but she was being played by a totally different actress (Jane Sibbett). Barone left the show, presumably completely unaware how massive it would become, because the part apparently wasn't big enough. GETTY Ross, Carol and Susan battled over how to handle their unique situation in the second ever episode NBC Anita Barone only appeared once as Carol Willick GETTY Jane Sibbett took the role from Anita Barone when she left, and saw through the pregnancy storyline Although Carol featured as a significant part of the story throughout Friends' 10 years on air, she was only a recurring character who popped up every so often. That being said, she was part of some major storylines - such as when Ross and Rachel were battling against one another after their break-up, and when Ben very nearly became a child star! However, Barone was looking to be a more permanent fixture on another project and so decided to leave Friends behind her and audition for other shows. After Friends, she played a couple of one-off roles on little known American TV shows before landing a role on The Jeff Foxworthy Show - a sitcom starring comedian Jeff Foxworthy. As was her plan, she landed a major role, playing the lead character's wife Karen. But the show was ill-fated, and was cancelled after just one season on American network ABC. This wasn't the end of the road for the series, as NBC picked it up and granted it a second run. But it was a case of history repeating for Barone, who was once again replaced with a different actress (Ann Cusack) as the series continued. GETTY Carol went through to appear consistently throughout Friends GETTY The role of Carol was then filled by Jane Sibbett GETTY Anita Barone's career did not take her to the same recognition that Friends would have The seemingly unlucky Barone went on to take further one-off roles in lesser known shows, and a few parts in hit TV series too.

In 2000 she was cast in another sitcom, called Daddio, once again as the wife of the lead character (comedian Michael Chiklis). But, in more bad luck, this show was also cancelled. The first season consisted of five episodes, was renewed for a second season of 13 episodes but only four were aired before NBC axed it due to awful ratings. Five years later, the same pattern repeated itself AGAIN, with Barone landing another role as \"the wife\" in a sitcom. This time it was The War at Home, which had a better success rate than her previous series. The show ran for two full seasons, totalling of 44 episodes and was recognised for its handling of the coming out story arc of character Kenny.

But, in a new thread on Reddit, users have spoken candidly about their biggest regrets of their lives. Redditor B0diless started the new thread asking fellow users: 'What's your biggest regret in life so far?'  It wasn't long before members came forward to share the moments that have haunted them for years. The old saying goes 'it is the things you don't do in life that you most regret' and many users found this to be true. In several heartbreaking admissions users revealed that they ruminated over letting a love go. Others, however, wished that they had spent less time in relationships and more time being single.  Guilt over an affair was the one regret that plagued one user who says she was otherwise a good person.  In more tragic confessions people encouraged fellow users to appreciate their nearest and dearest because you never know how long they have left. Letting themselves go was also a major regret for many of those contributing to the thread admitting they wish they had kept their fitness up. It wasn't just weight that proved to be among people's regrets with smoking also proving a disappointment.  Others said that it was spending too long focusing on work or school rather than enjoying life that they dwell on.  Several admitted that they had the opposite problem and wished that they had pursued more career opportunities.  One user revealed that they wish they had spent less time worrying about their future and more time living in the moment.

            "Paragraph: The fears surrounding ageing are twofold; there is the natural decline of the body and the spectre of a physiological disease like arthritis. There are also issues like memory loss and the decrease in cognitive functions to contend with. A small strata of society, referred to as \"superagers\" by neurologist Marsel Mesulam, not only retain their mental sharpness well into old age, but their cognitive abilities might even rival that of a healthy 25 year old. Neurologist Lisa Feldman Barrett and her team studied the brains of 17 of these 'superagers', and compared them with people of a similar age. Findings showed that the brain regions associated with emotion – like the midcingulate cortex and the anterior insula - were thicker in the superagers, and thinner for regular agers. They theorised these regions were responsible for their more alert state. Now for the question on everyone's lips: Barrett puts it simply as this: work hard at something. Characterising the brain as a muscle, the only way to make it strong is by consistently pushing it to its limits. The brain regions which are thicker in superagers are active when a person undergoes a difficult task that requires concentration, whether that is mental – like regularly playing chess, or solving difficult maths equations – or physical. For example, say you’ve signed up for a vigorous Muay Thai class that leaves you feeling physically exhausted: the more often you put your body through high levels of stress, the quicker it can build fitness, muscle and strength, and activities you previously found difficult will become easier. The same theory applies for your mind.\n",

            "Paragraph: You like the best of things but you can easily compromise. 1. When it comes to food, you won’t just eat any old thing. 2. Because you’re partial to fancy hipster foods, like expensive artisanal bread. 3. However, you’ll happily skimp on other items to afford your luxurious foodie lifestyle. It’s all about balance, after all. 4. You know exactly what you like to drink and won’t order anything else, even if it’s cheaper. 5. But no glasses? No problem! 6.

When you order something to eat or drink, you’re not afraid to ask for it to be made to your exact specifications. 11. But if you’re in a situation where it would be rude or not possible to ask for modifications, you’ll just eat what you’re given. 12. Because your standards are pretty high, people expect the best from you at all times. 13. Which can be an exhausting pressure because you’re actually quite lazy. 14.

            "Paragraph: By now you've seen all the big news around  games like Marvel vs. Capcom, The Last of Us, and Uncharted. But there was plenty more revealed during the 2016 PlayStation Experience keynote. SEE ALSO: Beloved 'Destiny' exotic Ice Breaker returns this winter If you want to see everything, just go re-watch the whole keynote. But if you want the TL;DR of it all, read on for six reveals that might have slipped past you in the midst of all the excitement. 1. Call of Duty World League 2017 has a huge prize pool The Call of Duty World League returns in 2017 and it's got a total prize pool valued at $4 million. There are plenty more details to be revealed about the upcoming season's lineup of regional tournaments. Keep an eye on Call of Duty's esports page for more. 2. Akuma returns in Street Fighter V The bad guy fighter Akuma, who made his debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, is coming back in Street Fighter V. He'll be available — along with five other fighters — as part of the game's Character Pass. Check out the first gameplay in the trailer above. 3. Studio Ghibli's JRPG returns with a sequel It's not clear if Studio Ghibli is still involved, but the film company's JRPG collaboration with Level-5, titled Ni No Kuni, returns in 2017 with a sequel, Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Wings. 4.

            "Paragraph: As of Oct. 1, possession of marijuana is decriminalized in Switzerland. Anyone over the age of 18 caught with 10 grams or less of the drug will no longer have to make a court appearance and will not have offenses entered into their permanent record; instead, violators will have to pay a fine of 100 Swiss Francs (approximately $110), then be on their way. Lawmakers in the country relaxed weed regulations in an effort to unify what had been a patchwork of often confusing policies that varied from one local area to another. Per The Independent, the measure is also expected to save money by cutting back on the 30,000 marijuana-related cases courts have had to handle each year. It will also free up police resources to pursue larger drug trafficking incidents. But \"decriminalized\" is not the same as \"legal,\" as a Swiss Broadcasting Corporation report makes clear. Growing marijuana plants, imbibing the drug in any form and dealing it are still forbidden. Penalties are now stricter for anyone caught selling to a person under the age of 18. The new law also provides greater resources to help children with marijuana habits. A 2013 UNICEF report found Swiss children are the world's second-most likely to smoke marijuana, with just over 24 percent of 11, 13 and 15-year-olds having smoked pot in the last year. For perspective, Canada leads the world in kids' marijuana use, with 28 percent of its children aged 11, 13, and 15 admitting to smoking pot in the past 12 months.\n",

            "Paragraph: Pots and pans wouldn’t be much without the lids that come with them. It might seem like a silly thing, but it’s much more difficult to boil water or even allow food to simmer without a lid to contain some of that heat. And an essential part of any pot or pan lid is the handle; this is the crucial piece that keeps you from getting burned by the steaming hot surface. So if your pots and pan lids are missing their handles, you’ve just entered some potentially dangerous cooking territory. If your lids are broken like this, you’d have to throw them away, right? Wrong! With this simple DIY, you can not only fix your lids, but you can also give them a stylish upgrade! It’s a completely free project and it will make your pot and pan lids usable once more. You only need three simple materials to get a functional pot or pan lid! Most likely, you have all of them hanging around the house right now. If not, they’re easy to get a hold of and relatively inexpensive (one item comes at a slightly higher cost, but it’s one we think you’ll be willing to pay.) Here’s what you’ll need to get started: Materials Wine cork Screwdriver Screw Washer Instructions Place your cork on one of the empty holes on the top of your lid. Try to center it as best you can. Flip the lid over so it’s balancing on the cork; feel free to grab the lid by the cork to keep pressure on it instead of balancing it. Put your washer around the hole and prep your screw. Take your screw and screwdriver and work the screw into the cork, continuing to apply pressure to the cork. By simply replacing your handle with a regular wine cork, you’ve created a soft, heat-resistant new handle that looks stylish, too! Not only that, but it was most likely free to revive your lid – if you had to buy anything, it was probably a bottle of wine so you could scavenge the cork. We’re willing to bet that you’re not too upset with that investment. This DIY does depend a lot on HOW your lid handle broke. In some circumstances, you may have to remove lingering screws or even pieces of the broken handle from the lid. Naturally, those are steps that would take place before the outlined instructions above. But once all is said and done, you’ll have a new handle that you can easily grab (even when your hands are wet) and won’t burn you! Best of all, the DIY cork handle is also dishwasher-safe, so you don’t have to clean your upgraded lids in some new, bizarre way. Your new cork handle is going to look so great, you might want to replace all your other boring lid handles with this hack! This is also a great way to use up some wine corks if you like to stockpile them like I do. What do you think of this creative DIY? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.\n",

The oft-discussed issue of uniforms came up in meeting held by the U.K.'s Telegraph reported. A group of six experts, including policymakers, organization leaders, and educators, were summoned in a roundtable format to address members of parliament and discuss their findings on Tuesday. Apparently, the committee attributes online pornography, a culture of victim-blaming, and a systemic misogyny prevalent in society (that would be difficult to address unless wider cultural attitudes are tackled) as reasons why young girls might feel threatened or vulnerable in a skirt at school. The oft-discussed issue of uniforms came up in meeting held by the U.K.'s Women and Equalities Committee , which was created in 2013 to examine gender equality issues.

A The investigation is certainly timely, given data from recent years regarding sexual harassment in the U.K. — and recent conversation (and controversy) surrounding uniform policing across the globe. Between 2011 and 2014, there were 5,500 sexual offenses reported in British schools, according to a 2015 report from the. A Girlguiding survey, also released last year, revealed that 75% of young women have felt anxiety over the possibilities of facing sexual harassment in their everyday lives, with a shocking 90% of 13 to 21 year olds agreeing that schools should do more to address sexual harassment in classrooms. \"We've heard from girls who tell us you don't leave school as a girl without being called a slut, that to wear shorts under your skirt to prevent boys revealing your underwear in the playground is just normal behavior,\" Sophie Bennett, co-director of \"We've heard from girls who tell us you don't leave school as a girl without being called a slut, that to wear shorts under your skirt to prevent boys revealing your underwear in the playground is just normal behavior,\" Sophie Bennett, co-director of U.K. Feminista , an organization that campaigns for gender equality, told the committee. \"There is that sense of a normalized culture of sexual harassment in schools where girls don't feel able to report it and instead change their own behavior, such as wearing shorts under their skirts.\" This echoes the response the Women and Equalities Committee received in April, when it This echoes the response the Women and Equalities Committee received in April, when it spoke with 300 \"young people\" in the U.K., prior to launching its official investigation, in order to gauge how people in that demographic felt about the issue of sexual assault in schools, the Huffington Post reports. Back then, those surveyed told the committee that officials and teachers were not only dismissing incidents of harassment that were brought to their attention, but they were also downplaying the pressures of bullying that students can face. In turn, survivors feared being reprimanded for coming forward, according to the report. The committee agreed that sexual harassment is indeed an issue students face every day in school and that those in positions of power (i.e., principals or teachers) don't necessarily know how to recognize and address it. Susie McDonald, chief executive officer of Susie McDonald, chief executive officer of Tender , a U.K. charity devoted to anti-abuse, explained to the Committee that despite a \"seismic shift\" towards teachers feeling emboldened enough to report harassment, there still exists a \"fear that if they're reporting sexual violence, what it will do to their reputation and how it will impact Ofsted checks.\" (The latter is an organization that helps regulate the quality and care of students in schools.) A representative for Ofsted told the BBC that it takes into account how a school's leadership address concerns of harassment as part of its inspections. McDonald added that after talking to a group of female students in London about how to combat harassment, she felt that allowing girls to wear pants is a nice idea, but it won't actually put any emphasis on changing boys' attitudes towards their classmates. The issue of whether skirts are \"distracting\" to male peers has been a hot topic as of late.

However, Dr. Fiona Vera-gray , a research fellow at Durham University, argued that isolated case studies were of little use and that the problem runs far deeper. \"To fix what's going on in schools, we also need to think more broadly about changing attitudes in the general population,\" she said.\n",

            "Paragraph: The sneaky designers at Beats by Dre employ a clever trick to make you think that the company’s plastic headphones are durable products worth the premium price. Beats by Dre headphones are garbage. Besides their crappy sound, they’re basically designed to break. And yet they sell millions of pairs of headphones. It’s practically a perfect business: Take crap and sell it for a fortune. How do they do it? In part it’s marketing, and you know, Dr. Dre. But there’s more. A detailed teardown (via PopMech) of a pair of Beats’ immensely popular Solo headphones conducted by hardware-focused venture capital firm Bolt has some answers buried beneath. The headphones are incredibly cheaply made. The company cuts corners everywhere it can; gluing pieces together instead of using screws, and reducing the amount of tooling wherever possible. Amazingly, for all the company’s claims about precision sound design, the headphones use freaking off-the-shelf drivers! None of this is all that surprising because Beats are, after all, terrible and fragile. The crazy part is that the headphones are so cheap that Beats actually needs to add weight to make them feel heftier. From the Medium post: One of the great things about the solo headphones is how substantial they feel. A little bit of weight makes the product feel solid, durable, and valuable. One way to do this cheaply is to make some components out of metal in order to add weight. In these headphones, 30% of the weight comes from four tiny metal parts that are there for the sole purpose of adding weight. Here is an image illustrating this point: On the left, all of the components that actually do something. On the right, four pieces of metal designed specifically to add weight to the product. Image courtesy of Bolt. Sponsored I was not aware of this particular trick. Obviously, product designers use all sorts of aesthetic design cues to make things look fancier than they really are, but in this case, it’s downright deceptive. Mostly though, it’s amusing. The cans are so dainty, Beats felt the need to beef em up a little.\n",

            "Paragraph: You may have noticed that drinking alcohol can sometimes make your poop habits a little...shitty. If alcohol doesn't mess with your poops at all, consider yourself lucky. Maybe it happens while you're drinking, and you end up trapped in a bar bathroom praying for mercy. You know it's bad when you actually have to sit down on those gross toilets. ...or you spend the entire morning after on the toilet. Either way, alcohol poops are no fun. To get to the bottom of this, BuzzFeed Health reached out to two experts: Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, gastroenterologist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, and Dr. Ali Keshavarzian, director of digestive diseases at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and grantee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). So, here's why booze can be a literal shitshow sometimes: First, let's go over how alcohol is actually processed through your digestive system. When alcohol hits the stomach, a little bit is absorbed through the stomach lining. The rest ends up sloshing around in your stomach before it goes to the small intestine. In the small intestine, alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. What's left after that is waste products and water, which moves through the large intestine (colon) until it reaches the rectum, and leaves the body...as poop. Along this magical journey, alcohol can screw with everything from your stomach enzymes to the speed of digestion, all of which can wreak havoc on your poops. Alcohol can ~speed things along~ in your intestinal tract, which is you why you might have diarrhea after drinking. The muscles of the colon contract and relax to push waste out of the body, explains Ganjhu, and alcohol can speed up those contractions. \"The increased transit time means there's less time for absorption of water in the colon, so the stools are watery and come out as diarrhea,\" says Keshavarzian. Rapid colon movements also make you feel like you need to go immediately, which explains why you sometimes need to sprint to the bar bathroom. But you're also drinking way more fluids than normal, which can loosen and liquify your stools. You consume way more liquid than normal in a night of drinking, especially if you're alternating your drinks with water — which you should. Most of the liquids end up in your bladder or they get reabsorbed in the colon, but sometimes the excess fluids end up in your stool instead, Ganjhu says. And we all know that watery, loose stool is also harder to control, so things can get a little ~explosive~. Your post-party poop problems might also be tied to certain types of alcohol or mixers. Some people have intolerances or allergies to the non-alcoholic compounds in alcohol, like the gluten from wheat in beer or the grape in wine. \"Many people have a reaction to the tanins from grape skins in red wine, which can cause nausea and diarrhea,\" says Keshavarzian. All those sugary sodas and juices mixed in cocktails can wreck your stomach, too. Drinks that are high in sugar can cause rapid gastric emptying, says Keshavarzian, where the contents of your stomach move too fast into the small intestine (cue diarrhea). And let's not rule out drunk food, either... And if you already have bowel issues or an intestinal disease like IBS, alcohol can be even worse on your gut. Doctors typically advise laying off alcohol if you have a very sensitive stomach or an intestinal disease like IBS or ulcerative colitis, says Ganjhu. Not only can alcohol worsen symptoms like diarrhea, but they can also cause additional irritation or inflammation. \"People with these diseases simply can't tolerate alcohol in the digestive tract as well as other people can,\" says Keshavarzian. On the other hand, intestinal disease could actually be the underlying problem. If you tend to have a lot of stomach or poop issues from drinking, you should visit your doctor to make sure you don't have an undiagnosed intestinal disease. But it's not just drunk poops you have to worry about. Sometimes alcohol can have the opposite effect. Alcohol can be dehydrating because it prevents your body from reabsorbing water, and at the same time you're losing more fluids through frequent urination. So if you're not drinking plenty of water with your alcohol, you can become dehydrated, which causes your poops to be harder and move slower, says Ganjhu. Translation: You're bloated and constipated. It also depends how much alcohol you drink. Interestingly enough, drinking higher amounts of alcohol doesn't always translate into more explosive diarrhea. Studies have shown that low amounts of alcohol can speed up the emptying of stomach contents into the intestines. But high amounts of alcohol can actually slow down the stomach's motility, which is more likely to cause bloating or feelings of constipation, says Ganjhu. Having food in your stomach might help reduce alcohol's effect on the intestines. Food helps to decrease the absorption of alcohol by slowing down the process of gastric emptying, says Ganjhu, when the contents of the stomach are dumped into the small intestine. That might make you feel a little bloated, but in general food will have a protective effect. Plus, you won't get hammered as fast. Drinking on an empty stomach on the other hand means more alcohol goes to the small intestine and gets absorbed into the blood so it can affect other organs like the colon, causing loose stools and diarrhea.\n",

But he might make a Step Brothers sequel. Will Ferrell has no plans to make a sequel to Elf. Unless it takes place in Japan. And features a Japanese family. We spoke to Ferrell and his Zoolander 2 co-star Kristen Wiig about the subject of belated sequels, with Elf, Step Brothers and a A Night at the Roxbury discussed. Though while we've transcribed the conversation below, you're probably best off watching the video above as it all gets a bit confusing. IGN: Are there any of your older movies that you think should have had a sequel? A Night at the Roxbury for example? Ferrell: No. Wiig: You’ve been asked to do Elf a lot haven’t you? Ferrell: Yeah. IGN: Please don’t do that! Ferrell: See. That’s the thing. I don’t think either of us are ever on that side of ever wanting to rush into a sequel of things that we really care about. If you can figure that out and come up with a story that justifies having an extension of the first one, then great. I’ve been asked and begged and prodded to do a sequel to that movie, and I’m with you. IGN: Could there ever be an idea for it? Ferrell: I think it’s hard – it’s a classic fish out of water story and it’s its own thing. Wiig: You are developing a TV show. Ferrell: I am developing a TV show called The Elfs. That’s not a sequel though, right? And it’s for Japan. Wiig: It’s where your character is now. But it’s not a a sequel. Ferrell: It’s not a sequel, but it’s Buddy, nearly close to 50, running around Japan. With a Japanese family... But it’s TV. It’s TV. IGN: We recently spoke to Adam McKay and he said that you guys have been throwing around ideas for a Step Brothers sequel. Is that something you would think about? Ferrell: We would. We had a great time – and now I’m going to totally contradict myself – we had a great time doing a sequel to Anchorman, and I think Step Brothers would definitely be in that same category. IGN: I suggested having it take place in an old people’s home and he said that’s something you guys have actually kicked around. Ferrell: We actually had kicked that around. But we may just do another idea. With John C. Reilly. Wiig: Where your parents are married. Ferrell: Where our parents are married. And we were raised in the North Pole.

            "Paragraph: Kerry Egan is a hospice chaplain and the author of \"On Living,\" and \"Fumbling: A Pilgrimage Tale of Love, Grief, and Spiritual Renewal on the Camino de Santiago.\" Talk with Kerry Egan on Facebook Live on CNN Health at 3 p.m. ET Tuesday, December 20. As a divinity school student, I had just started working as a student chaplain at a cancer hospital when my professor asked me about my work. I was 26 years old and still learning what a chaplain did. \"I talk to the patients,\" I told him. \"You talk to patients? And tell me, what do people who are sick and dying talk to the student chaplain about?\" he asked. I had never considered the question before. \"Well,\" I responded slowly, \"Mostly we talk about their families.\" \"Do you talk about God? \"Umm, not usually.\" \"Or their religion?\" \"Not so much.\" \"The meaning of their lives?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"And prayer? Do you lead them in prayer? Or ritual?\" \"Well,\" I hesitated. \"Sometimes. But not usually, not really.\" I felt derision creeping into the professor's voice. \"So you just visit people and talk about their families?\" \"Well, they talk. I mostly listen.\" \"Huh.\" He leaned back in his chair. A week later, in the middle of a lecture in this professor's packed class, he started to tell a story about a student he once met who was a chaplain intern at a hospital. \"And I asked her, 'What exactly do you do as a chaplain?' And she replied, 'Well, I talk to people about their families.' \" He paused for effect. \"And that was this student's understanding of faith! That was as deep as this person's spiritual life went! Talking about other people's families!\" The students laughed at the shallowness of the silly student. The professor was on a roll. \"And I thought to myself,\" he continued, \"that if I was ever sick in the hospital, if I was ever dying, that the last person I would ever want to see is some Harvard Divinity School student chaplain wanting to talk to me about my family.\" My body went numb with shame. At the time I thought that maybe, if I was a better chaplain, I would know how to talk to people about big spiritual questions. Maybe if dying people met with a good, experienced chaplain they would talk about God, I thought. Today, 13 years later, I am a hospice chaplain. I visit people who are dying -- in their homes, in hospitals, in nursing homes. And if you were to ask me the same question -- What do people who are sick and dying talk about with the chaplain? -- I, without hesitation or uncertainty, would give you the same answer. Mostly, they talk about their families: about their mothers and fathers, their sons and daughters. They talk about the love they felt, and the love they gave. Often they talk about love they did not receive, or the love they did not know how to offer, the love they withheld, or maybe never felt for the ones they should have loved unconditionally. They talk about how they learned what love is, and what it is not. And sometimes, when they are actively dying, fluid gurgling in their throats, they reach their hands out to things I cannot see and they call out to their parents: Mama, Daddy, Mother. What I did not understand when I was a student then, and what I would explain to that professor now, is that people talk to the chaplain about their families because that is how we talk about God. That is how we talk about the meaning of our lives. That is how we talk about the big spiritual questions of human existence. We don't live our lives in our heads, in theology and theories. We live our lives in our families: the families we are born into, the families we create, the families we make through the people we choose as friends. This is where we create our lives, this is where we find meaning, this is where our purpose becomes clear. Family is where we first experience love and where we first give it. It's probably the first place we've been hurt by someone we love, and hopefully the place we learn that love can overcome even the most painful rejection. This crucible of love is where we start to ask those big spiritual questions, and ultimately where they end. I have seen such expressions of love: A husband gently washing his wife's face with a cool washcloth, cupping the back of her bald head in his hand to get to the nape of her neck, because she is too weak to lift it from the pillow. A daughter spooning pudding into the mouth of her mother, a woman who has not recognized her for years. A wife arranging the pillow under the head of her husband's no-longer-breathing body as she helps the undertaker lift him onto the waiting stretcher. We don't learn the meaning of our lives by discussing it. It's not to be found in books or lecture halls or even churches or synagogues or mosques. It's discovered through these actions of love. If God is love, and we believe that to be true, then we learn about God when we learn about love. The first, and usually the last, classroom of love is the family. Sometimes that love is not only imperfect, it seems to be missing entirely. Monstrous things can happen in families. Too often, more often than I want to believe possible, patients tell me what it feels like when the person you love beats you or rapes you. They tell me what it feels like to know that you are utterly unwanted by your parents. They tell me what it feels like to be the target of someone's rage. They tell me what it feels like to know that you abandoned your children, or that your drinking destroyed your family, or that you failed to care for those who needed you. Even in these cases, I am amazed at the strength of the human soul. People who did not know love in their families know that they should have been loved. They somehow know what was missing, and what they deserved as children and adults. When the love is imperfect, or a family is destructive, something else can be learned: forgiveness. The spiritual work of being human is learning how to love and how to forgive. We don't have to use words of theology to talk about God; people who are close to death almost never do. We should learn from those who are dying that the best way to teach our children about God is by loving each other wholly and forgiving each other fully -- just as each of us longs to be loved and forgiven by our mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.\n",

            "Topic: ‘Global Warming is Good’ Says President Trump’s Science Guru\n",
            "Paragraph: If you want to know why President-elect Donald Trump is going to be so great not just for America but also for the causes of honest science, common sense, and weapons-grade trolling, look no further than his gloriously provocative recent meeting with William Happer, the Princeton physicist who argues (rightly, by the way) that ‘global warming’ is good for mankind. Professor Happer would make a great pick for a senior scientific post in the Trump administration, perhaps replacing the dismal and somewhat terrifying eugenicist John Holdren as Director of the Office of Science and Technology. First – and perhaps most importantly – it would drive the Greenies to the kind of sphincter-popping apoplexy not seen since Hillary lost the election. Second, in his courage, his decency, and his understanding of the truth about global warming science, Happer is exactly what America needs to restore a semblance of integrity to the discredited world of US government science after years of corruption, incompetence and neglect. To understand why I highly recommend taking time to enjoy this long-read interview about his life and highly distinguished career – the last part of which the liars, thugs and bullies of the climate alarmist establishment did everything in their power to ruin. Short version: Happer knew too much about the truth behind the global warming scam – so the greenies, led by a noisome vice-president by the name of Al Gore, tried to destroy him. About three months after the beginning of the Clinton administration, Hazel O’Leary called me into her office to ask, \"What have you done to Al Gore? I am told I have to fire you.\" I assume that the main thing that upset Al Gore (left) was my questioning of blatant propaganda about stratospheric ozone that was his focus at the time: \"ozone holes over Kennebunkport\" and similar nonsense. Being sacked by Al Gore is indeed probably the ultimate badge of honour in any true scientist’s career. In the interview, Happer, a modest man, skips lightly over what must have been a hurtful incident, deeply wounding to his professional pride. But Happer is by no means the only highly talented scientist who has suffered this fate in the last few decades. Basically almost every scientist in a position of public prominence who has dared speak out against the environmental consensus in the US and beyond has been either hounded out of office or, at best, had their life made a misery. Examples include Hal Lewis, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon, Pat Michaels and, most recently, Judith Curry. In no case was it was because their science was at fault, only their failure to fall in line with the correct Lysenko-like, Establishment-approved ideology. Happer’s scientific bona fides, for example, were – and are – exemplary. He got his job in government as a result of his work on a top secret weapons programme involving lasers. My invention of the sodium guide star gave me some credibility in parts of the US government, but since the work was highly classified in the first few years, only a few scientists knew about it. I scrupulously avoided working on related areas with my university students. But based on this classified notoriety, I was elected to be Chair of the JASON steering committee in 1987, and in 1990 I was appointed Director of the Office of Energy Research at the US Department of Energy (DOE) by President George H. W. Bush, where I served under Secretary of Energy, James Watkins, until the election of President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in the 1992 election. One of the many feeble criticisms against him by Greenies is that \"climate change\" is not his field – a charge he refutes in the interview: I often hear that since I am not a card-carrying climate scientist — that I, and many other scientists with views similar to mine, have no right to criticize the climate establishment. But as I have outlined above, few have a deeper understanding of the basic science of climate than I. Almost all big modern telescopes use my sodium guidestar to correct for atmospheric turbulence. It works. As we will see below, most climate models do not work. The history of science shows many examples of fields that needed outside criticism. A famous example is Andrei Sakharov’s leadership of opposition to Trofim Lysenko’s politicized biology in the Soviet Union. This is a good point. Happer and his fellow climate sceptical scientists are the Western world’s equivalent of the dissident scientists hounded by the Communist authorities in the Soviet era. We in the West may pride ourselves on having  created a world far freer, more open and more just than the one behind the Iron Curtain. But where dissent on matters like climate change is concerned, the treatment of scientists who have differed from the \"consensus\" has been little less disgraceful. Happer, for example, was fairly recently subjected to a sting operation by Greenpeace which attempted to smear him as someone who only speaks out against climate change nonsense in order to make money. The sting operation failed but the experience was horrible. The result of the Greenpeace smear included many hostile, obscene phone calls and emails with threats to me, my family, even my grandchildren. George Orwell wrote about these tactics in his novel, 1984, when he described the daily, obligatory \"Two Minutes of Hate\" for Emmanuel Goldstein (Leon Trotsky) and his agents, who were the enemies of Big Brother (Stalin) and his thugs. It has made Happer more determined than ever to speak the truth about supposed \"man-made\" global warming: The predicted warming from more CO2 is grossly exaggerated. The equilibrium warming from doubling CO2 is not going to be 3° C, which might marginally be considered a problem, but closer to 1° C, which will be beneficial. One should not forget that the \"global warming\" is an average value. There will be little warming in the tropics and little warming at midday. What warming occurs will be mostly in temperate and polar regions, and at night. This will extend the agricultural growing season in many countries like Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia. More CO2greatly increases the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants and makes land plants more drought-resistant. So, the net result of more CO2 will be strongly beneficial for humanity. On the role of government in \"combatting\" climate change, Happer echoes Ronald Reagan. Government actions to combat the non-existent problem have blighted the landscape with windmills and solar farms. They have driven up the price of electricity, which has disproportionately harmed the poorest segments of society. Government actions have corrupted science, which has been flooded by money to produce politically correct results. It is time for governments to finally admit the truth about global warming. Warming is not the problem. Government action is the problem. The fact that Donald Trump is taking advice from this excellent man shows that America’s science future – and by extension – the world’s is finally in safe hands. It also serves notice that the Mafia-bullying tactics of organisations like Greenpeace are in future likely to get extremely short shrift from the Trump administration.\n",

            "Topic: Trump Is Paying Himself With Campaign Cash. Is That Legal?\n",
            "Paragraph: Trump Is Paying Himself With Campaign Cash. Is That Legal? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to supporters at his primary election night event at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., Tuesday, March 15, 2016. CREDIT: AP PHOTO/GERALD HERBERT There’s a lot to unpack in Donald Trump’s latest campaign finance disclosure. For one, his campaign doesn’t have a lot of cash. For another, some of his individual expenses are pretty sketchy. But perhaps the most fascinating thing about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s financial report is how much money his campaign is spending on himself. In the month of May, Trump spent more than $1 million in campaign cash on his own businesses. Put another way, nearly 20 percent of Trump’s campaign spending last month went to benefit Trump-owned companies. Since Trump’s financial disclosure form was released on Monday, a good number of journalists have pointed out Trump’s propensity to spend campaign funds on his own companies. But what’s been less explored are the ethics behind this practice. Is it right for Trump to use his campaign’s money on his own businesses? Is it normal? Is it legal? It’s certainly not normal, according to Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government ethics watchdog group. It’s highly unusual to have a campaign paying a candidate’s businesses on anything like this scale. \"It’s highly unusual to have a campaign paying a candidate’s businesses on anything like this scale,\" he told ThinkProgress on Tuesday. \"It’s not that unusual to have some office space rented from the candidates’ business, but to have so many different businesses for so much of the campaign’s work, with the money essentially going to the candidate, that’s extremely unusual.\" Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, agreed that Trump’s persistent practice of paying himself was not normal for a presidential candidate. As for whether it’s legal, Painter told ThinkProgress that it might be — but Trump has to walk a fine line when it comes to how much he’s charging himself. \"If I were advising somebody in his situation, who had a campaign that owned a lot of hotels and other facilities, I’d say that you could use those facilities if you had an arms length transaction — if you were renting the facility for market value,\" Painter said. In other words, Painter said, if Trump wants to avoid breaking the law or being unethical, he must charge himself exactly the same amount of money as he would charge any other customer for use of his facilities. For example, if a Trump-owned hotel room goes for $400 per night, Trump must charge his campaign $400 per night if he wants to use that facility. There are a few reasons for this. Most of Trump’s businesses are corporations, which by law cannot make direct contributions to political campaigns. So, if Trump charged himself too little — say, if he only charged himself $300 per night for a $400 room — that would amount to a $100 contribution from his own corporation. That contribution would be illegal. Conversely, Bookbinder said, it would be unethical and possibly illegal if a Trump corporation charged the Trump campaign too much, because Trump would be essentially making money off of donations from other people. If [Trump’s businesses] are being overpaid, that could be an illegal personal use of campaign funds. \"If [Trump’s businesses] are being overpaid, that could be an illegal personal use of campaign funds,\" Bookbinder said. \"Basically, the candidate would be financially benefiting from his campaign improperly.\" The problem, both Bookbinder and Painter said, is that it’s very hard to figure out how much exactly Trump is charging his campaign for use of his own facilities, and whether those charges line up with market value. The campaign only provides a lump sum for how much it paid each of Trump’s businesses — it doesn’t provide detailed individual expenditures. Based on an initial look at the disclosure form, Painter said he doesn’t believe Trump is currently at a Jesse Jackson Jr.-type level of campaign fund misuse. What Painter does believe, however, is that Trump’s disclosure indicates that the candidate won’t part ways with his lucrative business holdings should he become president. \"What this does illustrate is that [Trump’s] very closely tied with his real estate holdings — he does not plan to get rid of them,\" Painter said. \"And that means all his conflicts of interests are not going to go away if he’s president.\" Indeed, Trump’s financial conflicts of interest would engorge if he was elected to the White House. The big difference is that, if Trump is elected president, conflict of interest laws that currently apply to him as a candidate will no longer be in effect. In the end, Bookbinder said, it will all come down to whether Trump honestly wants to use his campaign and the presidency for the public interest, and not his own personal financial gain. \"Are campaign decisions being made for the financial interest of the candidate, rather than for the best interest of the campaign, or in any sense the public interest? Is this campaign essentially partly a way to enrich Mr. Trump and his businesses? It’s very hard to know,\" Bookbinder said. \"And that raises some potentially troubling questions.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Yes, the pumpkin beers did start to flood the store shelves back in July, an annoying trend that started several years ago. But have you noticed there seems to be less pumpkin beer this year overall? It seems to be true. Brewers, including many in Upstate New York, have either stopped making pumpkin beers or are cutting back production. It's a big change: Pumpkin (or pumpkin-spice) beer was one of the biggest trends in craft beer in the past five years. The change dates back, in part, to the nationwide overproduction of pumpkin beers that reach a peak last fall. Pumpkin beers sat on shelves, and in some cases brewers had to buy it back from their distributors. It was the \"Great Pumpkin Debacle of 2015,\" said Gregg Stacy, director of sales and marketing for Ithaca Beer Co. Ithaca this year discontinued the fall seasonal beer, Country Pumpkin, which it had introduced in 2011. Overproduction is just part of the problem, Stacy said. Ithaca is moving away from seasonals in any case, and is looking for different beers to add to its portfolio. This year, it launched Hellish Lager, a more traditional light-colored German-style beer (such traditional beers may be the \"new\" trend in craft beer). Hellish Lager is \"the anti-pumpkin ale,\" Stacy said, noting that the pumpkin ale was never a big part of its production in any case. \"Pumpkin beer is cute, but it's not really what we do.\" Change is coming across the spectrum, from the biggest craft brewers to the smallest. Large brewers like Southern Tier in Jamestown (maker of Pumking and Warlock) are cutting back production, according to a story published at forbes.com. That story also noted big pumpkin producers like Harpoon Brewing in Massachussetts and Shipyard Brewing of Maine cut the volume of pumpkin beer they're making this year. Samuel Adams, which had been making two pumpkin beers, cut back to one this year, Forbes reported. In Utica, the relatively large Saranac Brewery (Matt Brewing Co.) still has its Pumpkin Ale for 2016, but tweaked the recipe to make the flavor \"more more prominent and robust,\" according to its digital marketer Anthony Jackson. Smaller breweries Upstate are paying close attention to the market. Cortland Beer Co. plans to make two batches of its Pumpkin Ale this year, but may not do a third, as it did last year. That was one batch too many in 2015, said Cortland Beer president Dan Cleary. Cortland expects to fill its accounts in the immediate Cortland area, but Cleary has found other markets, like Ithaca, have experienced pumpkin beer overload. \"I asked an Ithaca account about taking pumpkin this year, and he said, 'naaah.' \" Cleary said. In addition to the number of breweries that jumped into the pumpkin market in recent years, the early start in delivery to markets and bars may contribute to the fatigue factor, Cleary said. \"Definitely by Thanksgiving, it's dead,\" Cleary said. \"Maybe even earlier.\" Even a brewery that also operates its own pumpkin patch is cutting back. Critz Farms in Cazenovia is making just a small batch, said owner Matthew Critz. \"We heard about the over saturation last year, so we were careful this year,\" said Critz, who makes hard apple cider and beer at his farm, where he grows everything from apples and pumpkins to Christmas trees and makes maple products. From a famer's perspective, Critz doesn't think the cut back in pumpkin beers will hurt many growers. Most pumpkin beers base their recipes on the spices, and many also use squash instead of actual pumpkin anyway. (The pumpkin or squash adds body to the beer, but not much flavor). \"Frankly, our brewery and Empire (Brewing Co. in Syracuse) are some of the only ones that use real pumpkin anyway,\" Critz said. For those who still crave authentic pumpkin beers, his Critz Farms Pumpkin Ale may fit the bill: It's made with real pumpkins, not over-spiced and the pumpkins are drizzled with Critz maple syrup before they're roasted and added to the brew. \"Pumpkin beer became sort of a big marketing thing,\" Critz said. \"We can take it back to being a real farm product.\" Genesee Brewery in Rochester plans $49 million expansion, with state help Don Cazentre writes about food, beverages, restaurants and bars for syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.

            "Topic: 8 Habits That Make Millennials Stressed, Anxious And Unproductive\n",
            "Paragraph: According to the American Psychological Association (APA), millennials experience more stress and are less able to manage it than any other generation. More than half of us admit to having lain awake at night during the past month from stress. Not surprisingly, millennials are also more anxious than older Americans. The APA reports that 12% of millennials have a diagnosed anxiety disorder almost twice the percentage of Boomers. On a non-clinical scale, a BDA Morneau Shepell white paper discovered that 30% of working millennials have general anxiety, while a 2014 American College Health Association (ACHA) assessment found that anxiety regularly afflicts 61% of college students. Anxiety not only harms our wellbeing but also sabotages our productivity. The ACHA assessment found that the top two tolls on students' academic performance were stress and anxiety. Two-thirds of millennials interviewed by BDA attribute declining work performance to anxiety. Sources of millennial anxiety may include a tough job market and student debt as well as psychological causes I've covered previously such as ambition addiction, career crises and choice-overload. But even our day-to-day behaviors can incite anxiety. Here are eight common habits that instigate stress and compromise our potential: Flickr/Stefan 1. Bad sleep habits Perhaps the most prevalent contributor to anxiety is poor sleep. A study by the University of California at Berkeley found that lack of sleep may play a key role in ramping up the brain regions that contribute to excessive worrying. Common causes of insufficient sleep include going to bed at different times, not making sleep a priority and spending time on phones or laptops right before bed. Instead: Calm Clinic, an online magazine dedicated to anxiety management, suggests forming a long, boring nighttime routine free from technology, keeping a journal by your bed to write down thoughts that keep you awake, and exercising during the day to wear out your body. The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market Don't let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for good. 2. Skipping sustenance Eating consistently regulates not only our metabolism and insulin levels but also our mental stability. Waiting too long to eat or missing out on breakfast may lead to unsteady blood sugar levels, which can cause anxiety-like sensations, including shakiness, dizziness, confusion, and difficulty speaking, writes Body and Health. Dehydration has a similar effect. Because food and water are biological needs, anxiety naturally follows hunger and thirst. Instead: Eat meals regularly. Keep granola bars or nuts at your desk or in your purse. Bring a water bottle to work and sip it throughout the day. Have a glass of water right when you wake up and before you go to sleep. Unsplash 3. Drinking coffee Drinking coffee makes us more alert and, in many cases, helps us perform better on short-term tasks. But it can also make people jittery, irritable and nervous, especially if they're already predisposed to anxiety. Sensitivity to caffeine is, in fact, heightened in people with panic disorder and social phobia, and caffeine can provoke panic attacks in some individuals. Caffeine is also diuretic, which can cause dehydration an anxiety trigger established above. Instead: Try weaning off coffee by switching to just one cup a day, decaf or black tea. If you feel calmer and more in control after a couple weeks without it, commit to quitting and pull out all the stops. 4. Sitting America's surge of anxiety symptoms parallels our increasingly sedentary lifestyles. But, until a recent review by BMC Public Health, it was unclear whether the two were actually linked. After lengthy analysis, researchers found that the risk of anxiety risk increases as sedentary behavior increases and, specifically, sitting time spikes one's likelihood of experiencing anxiety. Instead: If you work at a desk all day, you're not doomed. Get up and walk around every ninety minutes. Offset your sitting time with regular exercise, which halves your risk of anxiety and depression. 5. Your phone  A 2014 study by Baylor University found that American students spend an average of nine hours a day on their phone. Of course, technology vastly improves our lives in innumerable ways. But too much of it makes us anxious. Screen-based entertainment increases central nervous system arousal, which can amplify anxiety. Social media is similarly associated with low moods and depression. Instead: Next time you're waiting or have nothing to do, leave your phone in your pocket or purse. Relinquish it as a means of alleviating boredom and instead use it consciously as needed for its useful functions. Flickr/Lily Monster 6. Not clocking out According to data from FORBES' @Work State of Mind Project, millennials become anxious and irritated when work intrudes on our personal lives. But our bad work-life balance is our own choosing. BDA's assessment explains, Millennials do not believe that productivity should be measured by the number of hours worked at the office, but by the output of the work performed. They view work as a 'thing' and not a 'place.' Even after we leave the office, we're still at work. Instead: We can still be ambitious, work long hours and impress our bosses without sacrificing psychological health and personal boundaries. So clock out: In your calendar, schedule a defined, consistent time at night to stop working. When time's up, mark that task complete and go take care of yourself. 7. Netflix and hanging out You may think snuggling up on the couch and watching a movie will help you unwind, but research disproves this trend. In one study, participants felt more depressed and anxious after watching just two hours of TV than those who didn't. Another study found that those with anxiety and depression spend significantly more time on the computer and watching television. While resting reduces anxiety short-term, research reveals that its effect is short lived, particularly compared with exercise. Instead: Do anything but watch TV when you're done with work. Go on a walk, grab drinks, knit, work, draw, write, sit in your room and look at the wall, call your mom, actually cook dinner, build something, play badminton. 8. Hanging out with anxious people You might feel like you've found someone you can vent to who understands you, but studies show that ruminating on anxiety often makes it worse. Furthermore, participating in intergroup anxiety increases one's anxious behaviors. Instead: Seek out people who level your mood. After you hang out with someone, ask yourself if you feel stable and well or if you're hyped up and on edge. It's easy to spend less time with certain people once you've decided they're bad for your health. If the annoyance, pain and performance impairment of day-to-day anxiety isn't enough to quit these bad habits, perhaps this is: According to Harvard Medical School, anxiety is implicated in heart disease, migraines, chronic respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal conditions. Despite our youth, chronic anxiety is not sustainable. By swapping out these daily practices, we can improve our moods and our lives one habit a time.\n",

            "Paragraph: That ex you can't seem to completely erase from your life MIGHT have a basement freezer stocked with hooker scalps. Ready to let go yet? A new study conducted by Oakland University psychologists Justin K. Mogilski and Lisa L.M. Welling suggests lovers who exhibit signs of narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism are less willing to let go of exes after breakups. Mogilski and Welling explored the alleged friendships of 861 exes. Along with answering questions about how they got along with their former flames post-breakups, participants filled out surveys intended to measure the prevalence of dark personality traits, like self-admiration, insensitivity and manipulation. The study discovered participants who exhibited more traits of a psychopath were also more likely to keep exes in their lives as \"friends.\" As if that weren't enough, their reasons for staying in touch weren't so much sentimental as they were pragmatic and self-serving (sexual access, established loyalty, etc.). You may have told all your friends before how \"done\" you are with Cory because he's \"honestly SO insane\" while secretly texting him under the table, but take a moment to listen to your own lies.

            "Paragraph: The hot button issue over the past few months has been over who uses what restroom. Unfortunately, while we’ve been dictating who can \"go\" where, we’ve been blinded by an even scarier truth (not a potential threat, but an actual one). Folks, we’ve been asking the wrong question. Instead of worrying about who \"uses\" what bathroom, we need to be concerned with who is \"WATCHING\" us in the bathroom, because you might be surprised. Recently, investigators in Florida have uncovered some very disturbing information regarding public restrooms, Hotel rooms and your privacy. Disguised as normal looking \"Coat Hooks\" these tiny deviced typically stuck to walls are actually spy cameras. \"In all three incidents, miniature cameras hidden in coat hooks were found mounted on the walls in the women’s restrooms. They were found at Anne’s Beach on May 26th, the Circle K Store at the 99.8 mile marker of Highway U.S. One on May 28th and in the women’s bathroom at Harry Harris Park in Tavernier today.\" At three different locations in the Florida Keys, investigators discovered hidden cameras in the women’s restrooms. However, these cameras weren’t hidden somewhere undetected. In fact, they were usually in plain sight, and nobody ever realized it. We live in a time where technology has made our lives more convenient, but that convenience unfortunately comes at a price. And that price is our privacy. Motion-activated cameras that look like coat hangers have been found on the back of doors in several public restrooms, but who knows how long they have been there, or if there are more throughout the state (or country). \"Anyone who has a public restroom on their property needs to check them closely,\" said Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay. \"If you find anything suspicious you think might contain a hidden camera, don’t touch it. Call us right away and we will respond.\" With the size of today’s cameras getting smaller and smaller, perverts are able to hide theirs inside small objects of many kind. Unless you know to be aware, you would have no idea you’re being watched. \"Nowadays, with the advances in technology, all you need to do is insert a MicroSD card,\" private investigator Carrie Kerskie stated. \"The battery life for these coat hooks, I looked it up, is two hours. Then, you just take it out, pop it in the computer, and you have all your images. It’s real simple and easy. They just walk in, hang it up, walk out, go back a few hours later and take it off.\" The terrifying reality about these cameras is that they are incredibly easy to purchase, and are actually advertised as home security cameras. Unfortunately, these devices have seemingly gotten into the wrong hands. The advertising for these cameras even show someone being spied on in a locker room. What Should I Do? First of all, you shouldn’t fear. These reports have only come from Florida (so far), so chances are you haven’t been spied on (yet). What we need to do is be aware of our surroundings. When using a public restroom, give the stall a quick glance and see if there is anything strange about it. The other thing we can do is spread the word. This could have a devastating impact on someone’s life if they were to fall victim to one of these ‘peeping Toms.’ Simply making others aware that this exists gives them the heads-up that this is out there. The media wants you to get fired up about who uses what restroom, when really we should be concerned about who is WATCHING us in the restroom. Stay alert, and let others know what to look for by SHARING this article. Stay safe, friends.\n",

            "Paragraph: During his tenure as CEO of Yum Brands from 1999 to 2015, David Novak turned a PepsiCo spinoff into a global leader in the fast-food industry through brands like Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut. Today, it has 41,000 restaurants across 125 countries and a market capitalization of about $33 billion. Novak is retiring this month from his role as Yum's executive chairman, but he took time to speak with Business Insider about the lessons he's learned throughout his career. As he illustrates in his new book, \"O Great One!,\" he considers recognizing great work at Yum to be the foundation for his success, and he advocates that all leaders follow suit. While it's up to managers to recognize their employees, the employees themselves can boost their chances of being recognized by working to become integral to their company from their first day on the job. It's why he tells all 20-somethings just starting their careers, \"When you go into your job, act like you own the place.\" Entitled 22-year-olds aren't going to win any friends at a company, but Novak isn't recommending that young employees behave arrogantly. Rather, he recommends they integrate themselves into their companies sooner rather than later. \"Don't just go in and do your job,\" he said. \"Think about what your coach ought to be doing, or the CEO ought to be doing. Take as broad a perspective on the company as possible, and always take a company view, not just your job view. And that will demonstrate to other people that you've got potential.\" He said that early in his own career, he would seek opportunities to have conversations with his bosses and tell them three things he'd be working on if he were in their place. It was a bold move for a young employee, but he kept it graceful by making them expressions of his own interest in his team's goals, rather than something patronizing. Novak said that neophytes needed to understand that the way to get people to teach you is to simply ask them questions, since \"everybody likes to talk about what they've learned.\" He recommended that new employees \"go find the four or five people in the company that you know are really highly respected and go have lunch with them,\" and then ask them about their own careers and how they learned to succeed at the company. \"And they'll take it as a compliment if you seek them out because they're viewed to be so successful and you've heard a lot of good things about them,\" he said. If 20-somethings can be driven and confident yet also respectful and open to input, they'll become recognized at the company, Novak said. And they shouldn't worry about feeling aggressive. \"A lot of people think that if you do stuff like that you're political,\" he said. \"You're not political. You're just wanting to learn. As long as you're never sacrificing your integrity, don't worry about anything. Just learn.\"\n",

            "Topic: The antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find GOD\n",
            "Paragraph: In the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her. The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it. The alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction. The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn’t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument. Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally. This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible. The GOD problem in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably César Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Köhler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013. In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose. Applications that could save millions of lives.\n",

            "Paragraph: Parents, they just don't understand. Right? Well, yes and no.  A new survey shows that when it comes to emoji, most seniors totally do get it. Except, that is, with one tiny eggplant-styled exception. SEE ALSO: Facebook's new emoji are finally available to everyone Great Senior Living, a site that focuses on senior care and retirement living, surveyed 500 people aged 55 and older on their emoji use and discovered that contrary to any ageist notions floating around, your parents and grandparents didn't just fall off the digital turnip truck. Over 86 percent of respondents had used emoji at least once, and a majority of them were deploying the pictographs in a manner we would deem to be correct.  \"One of the most recognized emojis by our respondents was the 'Hands Praying,'\" the findings explain. \"Almost 90 percent identified this emoji correctly, yet nearly 10 percent thought this emoji represented a high-five.\" It's totally legit to see 🙏 and think either \"hands praying\" or \"high five\" (Emojipedia says this one is technically called \"folded hands\" and can be interpreted as either), and those surveyed were clearly in the know.   The areas where misunderstanding did occur were for the most part reasonable. The classic poop emoji? Seventy-six percent nailed it, but 18 percent looked at that swirly 💩 and thought ice cream. The peach emoji, commonly used to refer to a butt, fared a little worse with 42 percent thinking it meant \"feeling peachy\" and 35 percent thinking it was just a general fruit. This would help explain any 🍑💩 texts from the parents — who doesn't love peach ice cream, after all?   The eggplant emoji, on the other hand, is apparently in need of a PR push.  SEE ALSO: Instagram won't let us interact with the eggplant emoji Sixty-nice percent (insert obligatory \"nice\") believed that 🍆 referred to either cooking eggplant or vegetables. And, well, while they're not wrong exactly the youngsters of the world know what it really means.  Interestingly, 29 percent of those surveyed had no problem identifying the eggplant as \"in reference to a penis.\" Far be it from me to speculate, but I would imagine there is some overlap in that latter group and the ones who identified 🙏 as a high five. Basically, just because you're over 55 doesn't mean you don't know how to party. Remember that, kids, because you won't be young forever — and as the hip emoji users of this survey make clear, getting on in your years doesn't mean the good emoji times need to stop. 🎉\n",

            "Paragraph: The running joke among Indian entrepreneurs is that it's easier to get a divorce than to shut down a company. And the experience of Stayzilla co-founders Yogendra Vasupal and Sachit Singhi shows that it can get extremely messy. Closing a company in India can take years, though opening one — or many — is easy enough. When Thirukumaran Nagarajan decided to close his edtech startup Eduraft in 2013, a year after setting it up, he simply ceased operations, returned investor money, and moved on. Two years later, the auditors at his current venture NinjaCart —his third attempt, and an agri-marketing platform that's managed to raise funding — advised him to formally close Eduraft. It's been four years since he decided to take them up on that advice but he's still trying to wind up the business. \"Since we didn't have any creditors and had returned our investor money, we thought we were good to go. Later, we found out that it is not as simple as that. Regulatory compliance requires a procedure to be followed while returning money. Not shutting an earlier venture can create roadblocks for the current venture. We are now getting ready to file the winding-up petition,\" says Nagarajan. While being an entrepreneur seems exciting and fail-fast is the new refrain, India's archaic laws and labyrinthine processes of liquidation make dealing with shutting down a startup far harder than handling the emotional struggle of giving up. And dealing with external stakeholders such as vendors and landlords — as in the case of Stayzilla — can complicate matters further. \"Closing a company under a liquidation process can take years. Abandoning a business is not the solution. Defaults in company law compliance and inherent shareholder obligations will lead to a black mark in the RoC's (Registrar of Companies') records,\" said Harshal Kamdar, partner, PwC. Kamdar says there are quicker ways of winding up. If an asset sale is undertaken, one can kill business in a week or two. If one can demonstrate that the company has no assets and operations for two years, the process can be faster. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which is being finalised, is expected to ease some of the pain involved in the liquidation process. \"The current regulations are drafted with a large company mindset. So whether it is a big corporate, for example Kingfisher Airlines, or a small startup, the procedure is broadly the same,\" said Kamdar. For consumer businesses, the process is particularly tedious. \"The legal processes make it impractical for a retail business to shut shop. For example, the company is expected to obtain a no-objection certificate from all its vendors. That's a hard thing to get,\" said K Vaitheeswaran, entrepreneur and e-commerce pioneer. Vaitheeswaran's Fabmall.com, which later became IndiaPlaza, was one of the earliest e-commerce companies set up in 1999. Vaitheeswaran knows firsthand — the difficulties and pain of dealing with employees, vendors and irate customers when a startup is in its death throes, after having had to watch suppliers and the landlord pick up and walk away with every movable asset in his Bengaluru office in 2013. \"Dealing with individuals is difficult. Large creditors follow due process and understand when a business folds. Smaller creditors don't take it well because a few lakhs is a huge dent for them. Any consumer-facing business is difficult to wrap up, especially if there are orders to be honoured or dues to be paid,\" he said. Natraj M, a vendor on IndiaPlaza, is clear that he will not engage with any e-commerce player after having burned his fingers not once, but twice. \"I had a personal relationship with Vaitheeswaran. When he gave me the news, it came as a shock, but there wasn't much I could do. I knew he had taken a hit and I had to commiserate,\" he said. \"But I'm not selling online again. It's too risky.\" Employees are among the first to bear the brunt of a slowdown in operations at a startup. While many are able to read the signs of a sinking ship — delayed salaries, payouts in instalments, cutting of perks and privileges — and bail out, those left behind can lose their cool. In November 2015, sacked employees of food delivery startup TinyOwl kept co-founder Gaurav Chaudhary hostage for over two days. They released him on the promise of notice period salary payment. Bengaluru-based logistics startup Townrush's office was vandalised by its delivery boys after non-payment of salaries for months. Experts say the big flaw in the government's Startup India plan is its failure to account for shutting down. \"We all know the high failure rate of startups. Three years down the line, there will be thousands of companies shutting down. We are staring at a huge social problem,\" said Vaitheeswaran.\n",

            "Paragraph: Yesterday, Yesterday, the New York Times reported an indisputable bombshell: Donald Trump has been offering prospective Vice Presidential nominees the chance to run the entire executive office — domestically and internationally: One day this past May, Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., reached out to a senior adviser to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who left the presidential race just a few weeks before. As a candidate, Kasich Did he have any interest in being the most powerful vice president in history? One day this past May, Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., reached out to a senior adviser to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who left the presidential race just a few weeks before. As a candidate, Kasich declared in March that Trump was \"really not prepared to be president of the United States,\" and the following month he took the highly unusual step of coordinating with his rival Senator Ted Cruz in an effort to deny Trump the nomination. But according to the Kasich adviser (who spoke only under the condition that he not be named), Donald Jr. wanted to make him an offer nonetheless: When Kasich’s adviser asked how this would be the case, Donald Jr. explained that his father’s vice president would be in charge of domestic and foreign policy. Then what, the adviser asked, would Trump be in charge of? \"Making America great again\" was the casual reply. Not only is this story sourced from the office of the Governor of Ohio, and former Republican presidential candidate, but it is also consistent with the Trump campaign’s prior, explicit statements as early as May 2016 : Not only is this story sourced from the office of the Governor of Ohio, and former Republican presidential candidate, Manafort sat down with the Huffington Post ’s Howard Fineman for a fairly long interview , and while the two covered quite a bit of ground, there was one exchange in particular that stood out for me. Huffington Post The vice presidential pick will also be part of the process of proving he’s ready for the White House, Manafort said. \"He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn’t want to do. He sees himself more as the chairman of the board, than even the CEO, let alone the COO. \" Yes, Melania’s plagiarism was newsworthy (and fun), and Cruz’s non-endorsement was newsworthy (and fun), but how in the world do the above revelations generate less news coverage? (It sure as hell can’t be that they are less fun.) What’s further amazing is that at least in the case of Dick Cheney we had a narrative of a powerful VP assuming and amassing unprecedented power. Here, the presidential candidate, the top-of-the-ticket, is actively seeking to give up power in advance. With that plan, Trump then went out to pick a VP out of an extremely limited pool of willing nominees and by considering ordinary, mundane political considerations. The end result is that voters don't even know what policies they are voting for, or whether the true inauguration speech was the VP nominee’s speech last night. How is this out-in-the-open and simultaneously a non-story? Cynics obviously may say \"Great, let anybody other than Trump be in charge,\" but that ignores that this (i) is just an added level of chaos and danger on top of an already untenable scenario, and (ii) should be an irrefutable, disqualifying argument today. Simply . . . it should be the most important story of the campaign yet. <tap> <tap> Is this microphone turned on?\n",

Charity alcohol concern, as well as a host of medical professions, point out the benefits of going sober - saving money, sleeping better and losing that beer gut.

Here is what he learned from drinking no alcohol for, as of January 2017, 28 months into his programme: Schneider saved $1,000 every month – just over £800. He calculated that he spent approximately $33 (£26) on alcohol every day. Woah.  The average pint in London costs just under £4, and if you have one or two a day after work, along with a few bottles of wine a week, the tally adds up. Schneider says that he \"doesn’t really go out anymore\". So often, social interaction revolves around alcohol and \"getting a drink\" with colleagues.  Abstaining actually frees up more of your time from that useless task, 'being sociable'. Not only does Schneider report sleeping - on average - longer, but he also has better mornings without the hangover that usually follows a pub night.\n",

            "Paragraph: *Jay Z voice* I got 99 problems and a certain film critic is definitely, maybe, probably one of them. 1. Fact: Jordan Peele’s Get Out is one of the best-reviewed films of 2017. The thriller sits at a very impressive 99% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Peele’s directorial debut recently crossed the oh-so-coveted $100 million mark at the domestic box office too. 2. At one point, the film held steady with a 100% fresh score — but that all came to a halt when one reviewer ripped the project. 3. National Review’s Armond White described Get Out in the headline of his review as the \"return of the get-whitey movie.\" In the piece, White critiqued Peele by comparing him to former president Barack Obama, saying that the film \"exploits racial discomfort,\" and asserting that the characters of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rod (Lil Rel Howery) \"are not complex beings,\" instead describing them as \"attitudes.\" 4. Get Out actor Lakeith Stanfield definitely didn’t hide his thoughts about White’s review on Twitter. Stanfield later deleted the tweet. 5. The movie still sits at 99% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, even though tons of other glowing reviews have since come in: It now has more than 200 fresh reviews to the one rotten one. But it’ll never get back to 100%. 6. \"We round to the nearest whole number, with two exceptions,\" a representative for Rotten Tomatoes told BuzzFeed News. \"We don’t round up to 100%, and we don’t round down to 0%. We reserve those absolutes for movies where every single review is fresh or every single review is rotten.\" 7. So what does Armond White have to say for himself?\n",

            "Topic: Don’t Act Your Age, Act Like a Millennial: 5 Lessons to Leverage\n",
            "Paragraph: Millennials get bad a rap, especially when it comes to their workplace reps. Gen X and Baby Boomer managers tend to judge millennials harshly for their work style and expectations and are often left wondering: \"What do millennials really want at work anyway?\" According to a 2014 study by IBM’s Institute for Business Value, they want the same things we all do. In fact, it turns out there are minimal differences between millennials and other generations when it comes to career aspirations. IBM researchers looked at 1,784 employees from 12 countries and six industries. The survey revealed that as many millennials want to make a positive impact at their workplace as their Generation X and Baby Boomer counterparts. Researchers also concluded that while millennials' \"digital proficiency\" sets them apart, they share similar attitudes with other generations around career, goals, recognition, engagement and leadership styles. By 2020, millennials will make up half of the American workforce so it's time to give up the blame game and start working together. We can and should leverage the unique gifts this group brings to the workplace and ride the wave known as \"millennial momentum\" to business success. Here are five lessons you can learn from your millennial colleagues: 1. Pay people with what motivates them Millennials appreciate diversity and understand that people aren't one size fits all. And like many workers today, they aren’t always motivated by bags of money. The work of Harvard University psychologist David McClelland on social motives taught us that we all have innate needs that drive us in our work lives. I use the four motivators of motivational currency: performance, people, power, and purpose. Successful motivational leadership is about being able to recognize primary motivations, read what motivates your team and lead with intention so you can motivate others quickly and efficiently. 2. Don’t be afraid to disrupt things Disruption is the new innovation, and millennials have the confidence to ask the right questions that lead to innovative products and approaches. They're persistent and they won’t simply stop at the first solution to a problem. But it's important to remember that disruption isn't about \"blowing things up\" just for the sake of it. It's about being open to change. A smart approach I learned from a millennial leader is to allow talent to pitch an innovative idea and then try it out internally to see if it has potential. The point is to not stifle the flow of ideas because that only stifles progress. 3. Use technology wisely, but not exclusively Contrary to popular opinion, millennials aren’t digital addicts who want to share everything on Snapchat and Instagram. You may be surprised to learn that while they’re great at navigating the digital landscape, they actually prefer face-to-face communication so sit down and have a conversation. That said, millennials know how to find information and create a buzz, so start seeking, whether it’s an app you've never heard of or business strategy you haven't used before. 4. Don't worry, be happy (it's healthy!) I know I am wired to worry and so are many of the Fortune 500 executives I work with. What I've learned is that millennials are better at connecting with people than problems. I recently talked to a hedge fund manager who has over $20 billion in assets under management, and yet he's still worried about making money. At some point there is a diminishing return on our worry investment. The lesson from millennials: Be driven when you need to be and enjoy the ride when and while you can. 5. Make excellence an expectation Instead of seeing millennials as entitled, look at it this way: Millennials believe they are destined for excellence. That desire for success, combined with guidance from you on how to navigate workplace challenges, is a stellar business strategy. While it’s effective to give clear feedback to someone who isn’t pulling his weight, it is not a smart business practice to vilify an entire generation. Labels limit innovation so lose them. Get out of the habit of talking about what millennials don’t do. Instead, find ways to build on what millennials naturally do. Engage in conversations about what their signature strengths are, what motivates them and the ideas they have. The return on your investment will pay dividends for yourself, your people and your business.\n",

            "Paragraph: If the twists and turns of the 2016 election have you longing for a time when you could turn on your TV to see high-minded political debate, you might be thrilled to learn that the cast of \"The West Wing\" recently reunited! The political drama ran on NBC from 1999 to 2006, and took audiences into the offices of White House staffers working for the fictitious Josiah Bartlet administration. Over the course of its run, the show won legions of die-hard fans, not to mention four consecutive Emmy awards for outstanding drama series. The show's stars — Bradley Whitford (\"Josh Lyman\"), Richard Schiff (\"Toby Ziegler\"), Dulé Hill (\"Charlie Young\"), Joshua Malina (\"Will Bailey\"), Janel Maloney (\"Donna Moss\"), Melissa Fitzgerald (\"Carol Fitzpatrick\"), along with creator and executive producer Aaron Sorkin — recently sat down with TODAY at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas. Cast members Martin Sheen, Allison Janney and Rob Lowe were unable to attend. Here are 7 things we learned from these White House \"staffers\": 1. Shows about politics can work While a drama set in the halls of the White House might seem commonplace these days (\"Scandal,\" \"House of Cards\" and \"Veep\"), \"The West Wing\" was a trendsetter. When the show debuted in 1999, Whitford acknowledges that \"it was very in the air that political shows don't work.\" \"The West Wing\" would go on to prove otherwise, for seven seasons. NBC The cast of \"The West Wing,\" pictured left to right: Richard Schiff as Toby Ziegler, Dule Hill as Charlie Young, Allison Janney as Claudia Jean 'C.J.' Cregg, John Spencer as Leo McGarry, Martin Sheen as President Josiah 'Jed' Bartlet, Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, Janel Moloney as Donna Moss, Bradley Whitford as Josh Lyman. 2. Who would President Bartlet endorse this year? Donald Trump? Hillary Clinton? Bernie Sanders? Who would President Bartlet endorse in the wild and crazy world of the 2016 presidential election? While Bartlet portrayer Martin Sheen was unable to make it to the reunion, the cast shared their opinions on the 2016 political race. Assessing the match-up, Sorkin alluded to his own concerns about Donald Trump and declared that, if he were a real person, President Bartlet \"would endorse Hillary Clinton.\" Who would President Bartlet endorse in 2016 race? Aaron Sorkin weighs in:https://t.co/0rZsutlgEv — TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 22, 2016 3. The best way to get cast on 'The West Wing'? Save the executive producer's life Actor Joshua Malina joined the program in season four as speechwriter Will Bailey. But his connection to Aaron Sorkin goes back a few decades, when Malina appeared in the Broadway production of Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\" One fateful night, Malina and Sorkin were bowling with the cast when Sorkin choked on a hamburger. Malina sprung to action, giving him the Heimlich. Sorkin acknowledges that Malina \"really did save my life,\" and perhaps not coincidentally, Malina went to appear in almost everything Sorkin has ever written (\"A Few Good Men,\" \"The American President\" and \"Sports Night\"). 4. Josh and Donna should have gotten together a lot sooner The relationship between Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Whitford) and his assistant Donna Moss (Moloney) may have been one of the slowest-burning romances in TV history. The two flirted for years, before finally locking lips in season seven. What took so long? Moloney reveals she never wanted the two to get together for fears that once the sexual tension was broken, her character would be phased out. Sorkin takes the blame in this instance, citing his own concerns that nothing interesting would happen if the two got together. The executive producer told TODAY that if he had to do it over again, he would've \"let them have a relationship.\" 5. The Broadway phenomenon 'Hamilton' owes a debt to 'The West Wing' Who is the biggest \"West Wing\" fan of all? According to the cast, it's none other than \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. The cast revealed that when they went backstage at the Tony Award-winning show, Miranda mentioned how the program inspired \"Hamilton.\" Miranda and his fellow \"Hamilton\" castmates even showed their love for the TV drama with a \"West Wing\"-inspired walk and talk when they paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue earlier this year. 6. Aaron Sorkin has never seen the later seasons of 'The West Wing' Aaron Sorkin created the program but left after season four to pursue other opportunities. The show soldiered on in Sorkin's absence for 3 more years, with new characters, dramatic plot lines, and a presidential election. But what did Sorkin think of the show's later seasons? The truth is, he never even watched. \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David (who left his own show midway through its run) advised him: \"You can't ever watch the show again — because you're gonna watch it and either it's going to be great and you're gonna be miserable, or it's gonna be less than great and you're gonna be miserable. But either way, you're gonna be miserable.\" Sorkin took David's advice and admits that watching those later seasons would have felt like \"watching somebody make out with my wife.\" 7. 'West Wing' reboot? Maybe... With so many reunions and reboots these days (Thanks, Netflix!), it seems like no television show ever really has to say goodbye. So is the cast ready to bring those iconic \"walk and talks\" back to TV? The group we spoke with say they'd be up for it, and Sorkin confesses \"if there was a way to bring it back without harming its legacy, I would.\" The response from \"West Wing\" fans? What’s next?!\n",

            "Topic: How to Bridge That Stubborn Pay Gap\n",
            "Paragraph: So what might work to close the gap? Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces. Publish Everyone’s Pay When employers publish people’s salaries, the pay gap shrinks. Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees’ arguments in wage bargaining. \"Even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms,\" he said. That has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men. Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits. A few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. President Obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the Labor Department. Other American companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O of Salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women’s salaries equal to men’s. Kimberly-Clark and PricewaterhouseCoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions. To Negotiate, or Not Men are paid more partly because they’re much more likely to ask for it. When receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students by Linda Babcock, an economist at the university. In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested. Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found. But her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. (As the actress Jennifer Lawrence wrote in Lenny after the Sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn’t fight for more because \"I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’ \") One solution, Ms. Babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations. Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers. \"We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,\" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter. Don’t Rely on Previous Salaries If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries. Google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth. In August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee’s previous salary when setting his or her new one. The acting director, Beth Cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. Women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors. \"Don’t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\" Ms. Babcock said. \"I think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\" Make Work Easier for Mothers Research has found that salaries at men and women’s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. The gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children. Sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. Sometimes their employers assume they’ll do so, even if they don’t. Policies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. In states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found. \"If a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that’s not the same as making a career choice,\" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. \"One thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers.\" Build More Flexible Workplaces Ms. Goldin of Harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. The gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. Then, women aren’t penalized as much for working fewer hours. Companies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. In a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient. Change the Law Federal law doesn’t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics. The strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in California this month. It says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal Equal Pay Act requires. The California law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay. Proposed federal legislation known as the Paycheck Fairness Act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier. But that legislation is stalled in Congress.\n",

NOM president Brian Brown said in a statement: Target and other companies need to be forced to realize that it is their alignment with the radical cause of redefining marriage that is \"bad for business\"—not states' marriage laws that uphold and protect the common-sense idea that kids do best with a mom and a dad! So I'm announcing a new boycott today, against Target, for insulting consumers like you and me. The brief they signed in court this week insinuates that people like you and me, who would vote to uphold traditional marriage, as akin to segregationists and racial bigots. Would you want to shop at a place that viewed you in that way? NOM, of course, has a history of vehemently opposing legislation and companies that support marriage rights for same-sex couples. In the past the organization has attempted boycotts of JP Morgan Chase and Starbucks, as well as generating hysteria surrounding any political or social gains made by the queer community.\n",

            "Paragraph: © Sebastian Kaulitzki/Hemera/Getty Images undefined Keeping a busy schedule may benefit the brain One of the best ways to keep your One of the best ways to keep your brain sharp as you get older may be to stay busy, according to new research. While scientists have previously recommended engaging in mentally challenging activities , a new study suggests that keeping a packed schedule may offer similar benefits. In a survey of over 300 people participating in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study, study authors found that among adults over the age of 50, having a busy schedule was associated with better brain processing, improved memory, sharper reasoning and better vocabulary. People in the study ranged from 50 to 89 years old, and the positive effect of busyness on the brain was consistent across age. This, the study authors conclude, suggests that keeping a busy lifestyle is important in middle age as well as old age. It’s possible that staying busy increases people’s ability to learn new things, as they may be exposed to different situations, people, and information on a daily basis, the researchers suggest. But it’s also possible that people with higher cognitive abilities are also more likely to be busier. The study cannot definitively determine that busyness alone causes better brain health. And what about the stress that can come from maintaining a tight schedule? \"We certainly considered that being very busy could hurt cognition,\" says study author Denise Park, director of research at the Center for Vital Longevity at The University of Texas at Dallas. \"Basically, the data suggest that the benefits of busyness outweigh the downside.\" Park says her team plans to further study the effects of busyness on the brain to hopefully further untangle the factors that improve or hamper cognition later in life.\n",

            "Paragraph: When questioned about her heart’s desire, this toddler had a sick response. Brandi Benner of Clover, South Carolina, has a 2-year-old daughter named Sophia who really wants to be a doctor when she grows up. Benner told The Huffington Post that Sophia is a big fan of the children’s show \"Doc McStuffins\" and takes her interest in medicine very seriously. \"She calls herself ‘Dr. Sophia,’\" Benner told HuffPost. \"Everyone in the house gets several checkups a day from her.\" According to Benner, a Dr. Sophia checkup includes listening to patients’ hearts with a toy stethoscope, checking for butterflies or bunnies in their ears with an otoscope and, of course, giving everyone a shot. Benner also said that her young daughter uses the correct names for all her play medical tools. \"The obsession is real,\" she said. On March 31, Benner took Sophia to Target to buy her a reward for using the potty for a month. In the toy aisle, Sophia was naturally drawn to one doll in particular: a girl in a white lab coat with a stethoscope around her neck.  According to a Facebook post Benner wrote about their visit to Target — which has gone viral, receiving over 520,000 likes and 200,000 shares — while the mother and Sophia were checking out, the cashier asked Sophia if she was buying the doll for a friend. Sophia told the cashier the doll was for her and was a reward for learning how to use the toilet. Benner wrote that the cashier then said: \"But she doesn’t look like you. We have lots of other dolls that look more like you.\" And Sophia shot back with: \"Yes, she does. She’s a doctor like I’m a doctor. And I’m a pretty girl and she’s a pretty girl. See her pretty hair? And see her stethoscope?\" Benner told HuffPost that her daughter’s explanation brought a smile to her face. \"Proud doesn’t even begin to describe it,\" she told HuffPost. The doll is now one of Sophia’s favorites. \"She named her Meagann Cece,\" Benner told HuffPost. \"Sophia now requires that Meagann come everywhere with her, including the bathroom. Which is only fitting, I guess.\" As for Target, a company representative told HuffPost that it wants \"to create an environment where guests feel welcomed, valued, and respected.\" Target added: \"We’re aware of this situation and will use it as a training opportunity with our team.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Stephen Colbert has tried extremely hard to remain as neutral as he can be during the presidential election season. After years of mocking the right on The Colbert Report, his late night show has attempted to remain above the fray. But lately, the sheer lunacy of the Donald Trump campaign and the growing concern that this narcissistic, dangerous buffoon might have a shot of actually winning has clearly weighed heavily on the host. Oftentimes before taping his show, Colbert will hang out with his audience and take questions. Sometimes they are personal ones, like this beautiful story about how he met his wife , but occasionally they are political. Tonight, the question of Donald Trump and his relationship with Vladimir Putin came up and Colbert clearly couldn’t help himself. An unidentified woman in the audience asks him what he would ask Donald Trump if the Republican nominee ever dared show up on his program, and Colbert ad libbed a one line takedown for the ages. Well, we’re not broadcasting right now so I guess I’d say ‘What does Vladimir Putin’s d*ck taste like?’ It brought the house down. It even managed to crack Colbert himself up. According to the Daily Beast’s Matt Wilstein, the joke killed so hard that the show’s writers and network execs are trying to figure out a way to throw it into the live show tonight. As ever with Trump’s searing comedy, there is an element of truth there. In the past week, the world has learned that Russia not only appears to have been responsible for hacking into the DNC’s private emails and releasing them to discredit Hillary Clinton, but that Donald Trump has uncomfortable ties to Putin. Things have only gotten worse for Trump after he gave a hastily arranged press conference with reporters that included to a message meant directly for Russia, encouraging the country to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them . He even promised they would be \"rewarded\" for the effort. Russia, if you are listening. I hope you are able to find the 30K emails that are missing. You will be rewarded mightily by the press. The comments have led to outrage on the left, silence on the right, and condemnation from many of America’s more preeminent leaders of the intelligence community. It’s also led to one of Stephen Colbert’s greatest jokes ever.\n",

            "Paragraph: Weltschmerz \"Werner Herzog, who understands more than just about anyone the terror of a cold and irrational universe, got some mileage out of remaking Nosferatu in 1979 by keeping what worked in the novel and in Murnau’s 1922 film and leaning heavily into the vampire’s weltschmerz.\"  A feeling of sentimental sadness or pessimism the weariness that comes with knowing that the world is going to let you down no matter what and there’s nothing you can do to stop it: this is what the Germans succinctly call Weltschmerz. Weltschmerz, or literally \"world-pain\" or \"world-weariness,\" first appeared in German in 1827 and was born out of the melancholy and pessimistic Romantic literary movement taking place in Germany at the time. It was coined by the author Jean Paul—born Johann Paul Friedrich Richter—in his novel Selina, where he used it to refer to Lord Byron’s disaffected loathing for the world. The word was popularized by Heinrich Heine not long after, who moved the word’s meaning away from active loathing and toward sentimental apathy. Weltschmerz was borrowed into English in the 1860s and while it has lost its direct tie to 19th-century Romanticism, it does retain a bit of the formality of its original uses.  Schadenfreude You’re on your way to work. There’s this jerk who’s weaving in and out of stop-and-go traffic in bursts of 50 mph. Cutting people off, riding people’s bumpers, even splitting the lane to get mere feet ahead of everyone else. They race up behind you and nearly rear-end you, then speed off up the shoulder. Five minutes and one mile down the road, you see flashing lights: the jerk’s been pulled over for reckless driving. That broad smile on your face as you pass the scene is a result of schadenfreude. A popular lookup on our site, schadenfreude is a noun that refers to the joy you might feel at another person’s pain. It’s a compound of the German noun Schaden, which means \"damage,\" and freude, which means \"joy.\" We know that the word was in use in the mid-1700s in Germany, where it appears in a few books with tales intended for children. It was popular in Germany: discussed by Schopenhauer, Kant, and Nietzsche, as well as used by Goethe, schadenfreude shows up in psychology books, literature for children, and critical theory for over 100 years before it appears in English. Why the late adoption into English? Early citations for the word in English indicate that schadenfreude was thought to be a shameful defect first of Germans, and then of humanity in general. In short, the feeling was unworthy, and therefore so was the word.  Schadenfreude was favored mostly among English-speaking academics until the early 1990s, when it was introduced to more general audiences by The Simpsons. In an episode that aired in October, 1991, Lisa explains what schadenfreude is to Homer, who is gloating at his neighbor’s failure. \"Boy,\" he marvels, \"those Germans have a word for everything.\" After that episode aired, we saw a steady increase in the written use of schadenfreude in English.  Schwärmerei Though less common in English prose than many of the other words on this list, schwärmerei is another word we’ve co-opted from German. But unlike other German loanwords, schwärmerei isn’t all doom and gloom. The word refers to excessive and unbridled enthusiasm or sentiment. Schwärmerei ultimately comes from the German verb schwärmen, which means \"to swarm.\" When Schwärmerei (with the umlaut) first appeared in German as a noun, it referred to the frenzied activity of bees swarming. In time, both schwärmen and Schwärmerei came to refer to any enthusiastic activity or feeling. Ironically, it wasn’t a particularly welcome word when it first appeared in English. Our earliest use of it in print is from the Edinburgh Review in 1845: \"His mind is both clear and strong, free from schwärmerei, (a word untranslatable, because the thing itself is un-English,) free from cant and affectation of all kinds.\" Once Schwärmerei came into English, it lost the umlaut and the initial capital that marked it as a German word and became schwarmerei. It usually gets it brief moment in the sun every spring during the National Spelling Bee, where it is one of the more difficult words that gets spelled in competition. Meanwhile, in German, Schwärmerei still refers to excessive enthusiasm or sentimentality, but it’s gained another meaning: it is one of the German words used for what we call puppy love. Doppelgänger Jean Paul (a.k.a. Johann Paul Richter) is also credited with coining another German word that we’ve borrowed into English: doppelgänger. The German Romantic movement of the late 1700s and early 1800s was a reaction against the rationalism of the age before, and as such, it ended up producing some literature and drama that focused on nature, individualism, and the unexplainable or supernatural. The doppelgänger is one aspect of the supernatural that took on new life during German Romanticism. A doppelgänger is an apparition from German folklore: the spirit double of a living person. To meet your own doppelgänger is a bad omen, and a sign that your death is imminent. Richter coined the word for something a little less sinister: in his 1796 novel Siebenkäs, the main character meets and talks to his alter ego, which Richter calls a Doppelgänger (or \"double-goer\" in German). But Richter’s word was used in German literature to refer to the spirit double. Doppelgängers showed up quite a bit in Romantic horror literature, and English adopted the word in the mid-1800s. The sinister connotations of doppelgänger have fallen to the wayside in recent years in English we generally use the word to refer to someone who looks a lot like another person instead of implying that one of those two people is a spirit double of the other.  Poltergeist Say the word poltergeist to Americans of a certain age, and they will immediately parrot back to you the iconic line from the 1982 movie called Poltergeist: \"They’re heeeeeeeere.\" The English word poltergeist predates the horror classic by about 140 years, first showing up in print in an 1848 book called The Night Side of Nature, or, Ghosts and Ghost Seers by Catherine Crowe. In that book, poltergeists are associated with German spirits, which makes sense: the German word Poltergeist dates back to the 16th century and appears frequently in the writings of Martin Luther, who is most famous for starting the Protestant Reformation. In fact, it’s possible that Luther was the one to coin the German word: he used it when describing events that people believed were caused by playful or mischievous spirits—Poltergeister. The word derives from the German verb poltern, which means \"to knock or rattle,\" and the noun Geist, which means \"ghost.\"  The English word poltergeist was, from its first appearance, associated with a whole host of phenomena. Crowe’s book retells several stories of ghosts that purportedly threw crockery on the floor, knocked over glasses and jam jars and clocks, and shattered bottles of rum and wine, and whose activity seemed to be attached to a specific person.  It’s not as though there was a sudden and meteoric rise in hauntings in the 1800s rather, there was sudden interest in them, helped along, no doubt, by the spiritualist movement, which came into prominence around the same time that the English word poltergeist did. Foosball If you’ve ever watched a TV show that’s set at a frat house, it’s likely you’ve seen people play foosball. It’s a table-based game that’s based (very loosely) on soccer, where players try to hit a small ball into their opponent’s goal by turning rods with wooden figures on them and \"kicking\" the ball \"downfield.\"  The word Foosball is an anglicized spelling of the German Fußball, which literally translates to \"foot ball.\" The origins of foosball, also called table soccer or table football are a little murky, but we can find evidence of patent applications for games called table football going back to 1891. According to one history of the game, west German firms began making tabletop \"kicker\" games after World War II, and the game gained popularity in Europe and abroad. The game became nationally known in the 1960s, when it became a competitive club sport. This is also around the time that foosball entered English. While the game in Germany may have been called Tischfußball, or \"table football,\" the shortened and anglicized foosball didn’t show up in English until 1966, when it was used in another patent filing.  Kindergarten Some German nouns have naturalized so well that we hardly think of them as foreigners. Kindergarten is one such word. The German word means, literally, \"children’s garden,\" and it was an invention of Friedrich Froebel, a German educator. Froebel was a 19th-century educator in Germany and something of a mystic. As he taught, he came to believe that education for young children was lacking: most young children were put in something akin to day care until formal schooling began in primary school. He believed that young children should be educated, rather than merely babysat, and that they should be educated primarily through play and exploration—that the care-centers for young children should benefit not just the adults who had to go to work and needed someone to watch their kids, but the kids who were stuck in these centers. Education for Froebel was less about acquiring knowledge, and more about discovering the \"inner relationship of things,\" by which he meant the interrelationship between nature, the person, and the spiritual.  He opened his first kindergarten in 1837, and the curriculum had three aspects: playing with toys, so young children could become familiar with inanimate objects and how they work playing games and singing songs, so that young children could not only exercise their bodies, but be instilled with what Froebel considered to be \"spirit\" and \"humanity\" and gardening and caring for animals, so young children could learn empathy for plants and animals. His experimental \"children’s garden\" garnered much interest, and by the 1880s, kindergartens had been opened in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Hungary, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States.  The word itself came into English in 1852—the same year that Froebel died. Flak There are a number of German words that came into English during the two World Wars. Flak is one of them. Flak came into English in the 1930s and originally referred to anti-aircraft guns, and then later to anti-aircraft fire, and especially the bursting shells of anti-aircraft fire. That later sense gave rise to flak jacket, or a jacket designed to protect the wearer from injury from flak, shrapnel , or bullets. In the 1960s, flak gained a much broader use: it came to refer to any sudden criticism. It shows up in sentences that still mirror its military flavor, like \"The company took some flak from unhappy investors.\" Flak is a direct borrowing from German, where it was actually an acronym. In German, new words can be created simply by smooshing together existing words, and this can lead to some really unwieldy compounds. (Mark Twain wrote, \"Some German words are so long that they have a perspective\" in an appendix to A Tramp Abroad that was appropriately titled The Awful German Language). One such compound was the name for an anti-aircraft gun: Fliegerabwehrkanone. The word was a compound of the earlier Fliegerabwehr, which means \"defense against air attack,\" and Kanone, which means \"cannon.\" Fliegerabwehr itself is another compound made up of Flieger, \"aviator,\" and Abwehr, \"defense.\" While not terribly long by German standards, Fliegerabwehrkanone was awkward enough that when the guns were used in the field of war, the name was shortened to Flak, from Fliegerabwehrkanone. Flak has been so far removed from its German origins that it’s often confused with another word, flack. The latter is used to refer to a press agent or spin doctor it’s been so confused with flak that we now consider flack to be a lesser-used variant spelling of flak.\n",

            "Paragraph: Expert Says: \"Look who’s going bankrupt next in America\" 04.01.2016 BY Mike Palmer, Stansberry Research No one believed Porter Stansberry eight years ago. As head of one of America’s largest independent financial research firms, Mr. Stansberry’s work back in 2008 led him to a bold, but worrisome, conclusion: He predicted that the world’s largest mortgage bankers–Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which at the time were responsible for nearly 50% of all the mortgages in America–would soon go bankrupt. In fact, in June of 2008, while their stock prices were still trading at well over $20 per share, Stansberry published a report to his customers titled: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Are Going to Zero.\" Inside this report, Stansberry explained: \"For those of you who don’t work in the financial industry, it might be hard for you to immediately grasp what’s so dangerous about the extreme amount of leverage employed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Let me explain exactly what Fannie and Freddie do and why they’re in so much jeopardy...\" We all know what happened next. Both agencies went bust—and if not for a bailout from the Federal Government, both would have declared bankruptcy. Barron’s – America’s second biggest financial newspaper – even wrote a story about Mr. Stansberry’s accurate prediction, and called it \"remarkably prescient\" Over the years, Mr. Stansberry has made a name for himself by accurately predicting the biggest and most important collapses in America. A few others he’s accurately identified well in advance include: General Motors, General Growth Property (America’s biggest mall owner), D.R. Horton (a homebuilder), and Gannett newspapers, to name just a few. Stansberry also predicted the recent collapse of oil and natural gas prices as early as 2010, when he wrote a report titled: \"Peak Oil is a Flat Lie.\" As Mr. Stansberry writes: \"No one believed me years ago when I said the world’s largest mortgage bankers would soon go bankrupt. And no one believed me when I said GM would fall apart... or that the same would happen to General Growth Properties. But that’s exactly what happened.\" And, that brings us to today... This collapse, says Stansberry, will change everything about our normal way of life: where you vacation... where you send your kids or grandkids to school... how and where you shop... the way you protect your family and home.\n",

            "Paragraph: Early in the morning on March 5, James Edward Loftis found himself facing two men in his South Carolina home. The men were demanding cab fare for the ride Loftis had just received. \"I’ll get your money,\" he told them, according to his own account given to police and recorded in an arrest warrant soon after. Instead, the warrant said, Loftis retrieved a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, returned to the living room and fired off eight shots, striking both men. He then went to get gas, cleaned his home with bleach and burned the two bodies, along with his clothes and towels, in the back yard, according to the document. On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, according to the Post and Courier . A prosecutor said the prosecution was moving forward in its case against Loftis. Nonetheless, a judge in the case granted bail to the 39-year-old, who faces murder charges for fatally shooting the cab driver, 46-year-old Guma Oz Dubar, and the other man, 32-year-old James Cody Newland. \"He’s a human being,\" defense attorney Stephen Harris said, according to the Post and Courier. \"He freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies. Nobody knows how you’re going to react when you kill two people.\" Harris said what Loftis did after the shooting was \"heinous,\" according to the Post and Courier. Berkeley County Deputy Solicitor Bryan Alfaro said the prosecution would continue pursuing the case, given Loftis’s inconsistent accounts of whether the men forced their way into the home or whether he let them in — a crucial part of his defense, according to the Post and Courier, because of South Carolina’s \"stand your ground\" law, which grants protection to homeowners who use deadly force against intruders. Stand-your-ground laws have sparked national debate, especially in the years following the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed African American teenager in Florida. An attorney for George Zimmerman did not invoke it as part of his legal defense, although a member of the jury later told CNN that they had weighed Florida’s stand-your-ground law before finding Zimmerman not guilty in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Gun rights advocates say such laws codify the right to protect one’s home, while opponents say they legalize the sometimes-deadly use of force. On Monday, Alfaro, the deputy solicitor, depicted Loftis’s actions in gruesome detail. \"They were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site,\" he said. Following the brutal events that early-March morning, Loftis did not call police. His wife did. Wilda Loftis told the authorities that her husband was having suicidal thoughts and had told her that he had killed \"them\" and put \"them\" in the back yard, according to the original arrest-warrant affidavit. After police arrived, she showed them bullet holes in the living room, above the couch. Investigators made their way to the backyard and discovered a disturbed patch of dirt. Then, they spoke to Loftis, who explained what happened. If and when Loftis posts his $250,000 bail — probably this week, the Post and Courier reported — he will be on house arrest, allowed only to leave for work, church, or visits with a doctor or his lawyer, according to the Post and Courier.\n",

            "Paragraph: Pine nuts are the fanciest of all the nuts. They’re smaller, cuter and have a sweet, subtle flavor. They also happen to cost a small fortune. But we buy them anyway because pine nuts make it worth it when we add them to our cooking — just think of all that summer pesto We never put much thought into pine nuts, except to be sure to keep them in stock when we had bunches of summer basil to work with. But just recently we were informed by a colleague as to where pine nuts came from — an adorable origin it turns out — and we realized we do not know enough about our favorite small nut. We fixed that. And here’s what we learned: 1 Pine nuts come from pine cones.  Flickr: BobMacInnes Once you read that sentence, it seems obvious. But we’ll gladly admit that we had never put the two together until recently. But knowing this fact makes us love pine nuts even more. Read on to find exactly how they’re formed. 2 Some pine nuts take three years to mature.  Flickr: cogdogblog Most pine nuts take roughly 18 months, but some can take up to three years. They bud in the beginning of spring and grow until the end of summer. The cones become dormant during fall and winter and reach maturity come the following spring/summer season. 3 Pine nuts are very difficult to harvest.  Flickr: brewbooks Pine nuts are ready to harvest about 10 days before the green cone begins to open. The cones are dried in a burlap bag in the sun for 20 days, to speed up the process of drying and opening. The cones are then smashed (as a way to quickly release the seeds) and the seeds are separated by hand from the cone fragments. The fact that it takes a lot of time and patience is an understatement — and justifies the high price of pine nuts. 4 The pine cone is only the pine nuts’ first shell.  Flickr: Zwedlana Pine nuts have a second shell, which also has to be removed before eating. (Are you beginning to finally forgive the high price?) The shell varies from very thick and challenging to remove to thinner and therefore easier to handle. 5 But pine nuts taste so good, so we deal with it.  Flickr: thebittenword.com They make pestos possible. They’re awesome toasted on top of pastas. They even give cookies an edge. Thank you pine nuts. 6 Pine nuts prefer the Northern Hemisphere.  Flickr: Serge Melki While all pine trees will produce a pine nut, there are only about 18 species that produce nuts large enough to be of value as human food. These trees are found in Asia, Europe and North America. 7 Pine nut mouth is real.  Flickr: StuartWebster Pine nuts can cause taste disturbance. It’s known as pine nut mouth or pine nut syndrome. It causes everything you eat to have a bitter, metallic taste. Luckily it’s not permanent — it only lasts a couple of days. It’s hypothesized that the particular species of pine responsible for this is the Pinus armandii in China. 8 Pine nut allergies are real too.  Flickr: jules:stonesoup But a whole lot less common. 9 Not all pine nuts are created equal.  Flickr: the cardinal de la ville The European variety are long and slender. Those from Asia are shorter and stubbier. The American pinyon nuts are larger and easier to shell. 10 People have been eating pine nuts since the Paleolithic period.  Flickr: wetwebwork Roman soldiers took them as campaign food when they raided Britain over 2000 years ago. And Greek authors mentioned pine nut trees as food producers as early as 300 BC. 11 Pine nuts are good for you, so eat up.  Flickr: veganbaking.net They are rich in the same healthy fats that other nuts contain and are full of antioxidants.\n",

            "Paragraph: A mom's viral Facebook post is highlighting the way mass shootings affect even the youngest children. On Wednesday, Stacey Wehrman Feeley posted a photo of her 3-year-old daughter standing on a toilet in their house. She explained why in an eye-opening caption. \"I took this picture because initially I thought it was funny,\" the mom wrote. \"I was going to send it to my husband to show what our mischievous little three-year-old was up to. However, the moment she told me what she was doing I broke down.\" \"She was practicing for a lockdown drill at her preschool and what you should do if you are stuck in a bathroom,\" Feeley explained. \"At that moment all innocence of what I thought my three-year-old possessed was gone.\" The mom implored politicians to \"take a look\" at her photo. \"This is your child, your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren and future generations to come,\" she wrote. \"They will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions. They are barely 3 and they will hide in bathroom stalls standing on top of toilet seats. I do not know what will be harder for them? Trying to remain quiet for an extended amount of time or trying to keep their balance without letting a foot slip below the stall door?\" Feeley launched into an earnest plea for action, calling for universal background checks, a universal registration database and limits on access to high-capacity magazines. \"No one thinks gun control will be 100% crime control. But maybe, just maybe, it helps 1% or 2% or 50%? Who knows unless we try?\" she wrote. From evoking the United States Constitution as a \"living document\" to asking about the NRA's role to mentioning mental health, Feeley makes it clear she will have whatever conversation it takes to impel political leaders to action. She writes, \"I applaud politicians like Senator Chris Murphy, but so many of our elected politicians can't manage to work together (maybe they shouldn't be paid for a job they can't do ... just saying) or since they are in bed with all the wrong people, it is up to us if we want change.\" To that end, the mom asks, \"Can I help?\" Addressing \"entrepreneurs,\" \"innovators,\" \"incubators\" and \"investors,\" Feeley writes, \"Can I help? Can I help you make a difference? I want to offer support. I cannot give you techie advice, expertise in healthcare, or financial backing, BUT maybe I can point you in the right direction? Maybe I know someone who knows someone who can help?\" \"I am not pretending to have all the answers or even a shred of them, but unless you want your children standing on top of a toilet, we need to do something!\" she concluded, asking others to share her post and adding the hashtags \"#dosomething\" \"#prayfororlando\" and \"#wecandobetter.\" Feeley's impassioned Facebook post has received over 8,200 likes and 11,300 shares.\n",

            "Paragraph: In the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, Bonnie Kuester is finally saying goodbye to her childhood home after 70 years. But rather than selling the property, Kuester is opting to give it away for free. Sounds like a house hunter's dream come true, does it not? There is one slight catch, though. Whoever takes the home will need to take care of transporting it — and covering all moving charges, fees, permits and utility charges that result from doing so. That's because local developer Granville Homes is planning to build 28 brand new town homes on the plot on which Kuester's home currently sits. The house is very important to Kuester. She moved into the home with her family in 1946 when she was just 3 years old, and she grew up there playing in the surrounding woods. The home was one of the first built along Lake Jeanette Road in Greensboro. Interested in checking out the free home for yourself?

            "Topic: Social media: Think again before you post those pics of your kids\n",
            "Paragraph: You might think it is cute to snap a photo of your toddler running around in a playground or having a temper tantrum for social media, but did you ever think it might be a mistake, or even illegal? The French Government earlier this year warned parents to stop posting images of their children on social media networks. Under France's rigorous privacy laws, parents could face penalties of up to a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($65,500) if convicted of publicising intimate details of their children without their consent. This new legality is powerful food for thought for parenting in the Facebook era. As adults, we often express dissatisfaction at the ways young people post their lives online. But if we turn the mirror on ourselves, do we as parents actually have the right to make our family photos public? If so, which ones? Part of the issue is our tendency for over-sharing. A recent study by Nominet, which handles the UK's .uk domain name registry, found parents post nearly 200 photos of their under fives online every year. This means that a child will feature in about 1,000 online photos before their fifth birthday. We have even got to the point where if you don't upload photos of your baby, others question whether you are a committed parent. This new norm means many children will have a powerful digital identity created by someone else. This process can be likened to the manufacturing of celebrity identities, where parents can potentially shape the public persona of their child in any way they want: child genius, disobedient, fashionista, fussy eater and so on. How do you think your own mum or dad might shape your online identity? Do you think it would be an accurate portrayal of who you are? There is also the issue of likes and comments on those photos. Without realising it, are we choosing to upload posts about our kids that we hope will get the most audience attention? If so, how is this skewing the identity we are shaping for them? We often tell our kids that once something is on the internet it is there forever, and this is a core concern for kids. Research shows that parents often have not considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that they are sharing about their child. Your child will not have much control over where that home video of her having an embarrassing first singing lesson ends up or who sees it. And for this generation of kids, the publicising of their lives can start even before they are born, when parents broadcast photos to all their friends and their friends' friends of the antenatal scan. Parents' actions are generally not maliciously intended. In fact, they actually often see they are exposing something personal about their own life in such posts rather than that of their child. There is also benefit from such sharing. Posts about your child bed-wetting might help a friend find solutions, or boost their patience for dealing with a similar issue with their own child. Many parents find this community of support important. Given the relative youth of social media, it is hard to say exactly how growing up online could affect children's privacy, safety and security. But social media has also been around long enough now — Facebook is now 14 years old — that it is important to seriously consider the issue. It is time to question how individuals — both children and adults — should manage boundaries around sharing personal information, and how they can control information that is shared about them. Posting embarrassing photos of others on Facebook without consent is definitely tricky territory, but what constitutes embarrassing is slightly different for everyone, which makes this new issue even more of a minefield. The answer of how to approach this new-found issue might be to listen to what kids have to say about it. Recent research from the University of Michigan asked children and parents to describe the rules they thought families should follow related to technology. Adults tend to think of these rules around how much time kids spend on screen, but about three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents share and do not share on social media. Many kids said parents should not post anything about them online without asking them. Both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. An image of the child playing on the swings at the park is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of them having a tantrum because their breakfast is not in their favourite bowl. If you're a parent looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioural problem, then a community approach is still very helpful, just do not post an image and your child's name as part of the post. This will help to limit the searchability and reach of it. Asking your children's consent is also part of the issue and part of the solution. Asking if your child likes the photos of them and whether you can put it up online can be a very quick and respectful conversation. It also sets up a great approach to your kids understanding digital etiquette. Parents sharing photos of their kids online is not only about digital identity. It is also about our obsession with taking photos of our kids, particularly when they shine (or do not shine) in their respective activities. This can make kids feel pressured to perform to help mum and dad get the right snap to share. What the children really want to see is you taking notice of them and acknowledging that they and their actions are important.

            "Paragraph: Republican politicians have been focused on voter fraud as a hot-button issue for most of the last decade. Despite repeated claims of rampant illegal voting, election and law enforcement officials have found no evidence that its a widespread problem.  The data (or lack thereof) makes it all the more noteworthy when a case of voter fraud is discovered. A story emerged late this week about a Texas woman who was sentenced to eight years in prison, thanks to some confusion on her part on whether she was allowed to vote or not. Rosa Maria Ortega, 37, is a permanent resident of the United States who the New York Times reports was brought to America as an infant. The Times relayed a piece of her family history, and shared how she first gained the ability to vote:  Ms. Ortega, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, came to Texas with her mother when she was an infant. More than a decade later, the family was scattered after the mother was arrested and deported. Two brothers born in Dallas automatically gained citizenship; Ms. Ortega became a permanent resident and gained a green card, her brother Tony Ortega, 35, said in an interview. As a Dallas County resident, she registered to vote and later cast ballots in elections in 2012 and 2014, her lawyer, [Clark] Birdsall, said. While that was illegal, there was no attempt to break the law, he maintained: Some government forms allow applicants to declare that they are permanent residents, but the voting registration form asks only whether an applicant is a citizen. Lacking the permanent resident option, he said, she ticked the 'citizen' box. When the county later mailed her a registration card, he said, she believed she 'was good to go.' The issue for Ortega was simple: people with \"permanent resident\" status are not permitted to vote in national, state, or local elections that require citizenship to cast a ballot. Exceptions to this rule in a modern setting are rare, and provisions to allow non-citizen voters to participate in local elections have often been met with dramatic pushback. Unaware of this distinction, it was Ortega's next move that raised alarm and sealed her fate: Ms. Ortega moved to neighboring Tarrant County and again registered, but this time checked a box affirming that she was not a citizen. When her application was rejected in March 2015, the trial showed, she called election officials and told them that she had previously voted in Dallas County without difficulty. Told that she could not vote unless she was a citizen, she asked for another application, and returned it with a check in the box affirming citizenship. That raised questions, and law enforcement officials arrested her on fraud charges. Ortega was close to escaping serious punishment for the offense, and her attorney supposedly set up a plea deal with Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton. County DA Sharen Wilson axed the deal, and publicly signaled her intent to crack down on voter fraud. \"In all aspects of society, people verify their identity,\" Wilson said. \"Why not for voting? This case shows a clear need to enforce the laws we already have.\" Prior to her conviction, Ortega was a registered Republican. She voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, and in 2014 she voted for Paxton -- the man whose office would eventually prosecute her -- in his successful bid for Texas AG.  The eight-year sentence and eventual deportation will have far-reaching effects on Ortega's family. Her four children, all between the ages of 13 and 16, are currently being supervised by other family members and Ortega's fiancee, the latter of whom has no legal custody of the children.  President Donald Trump has doubled down on his party's insistence that voter fraud is an issue. He has publicly called for a \"major\" investigation of the 2016 election, echoing widely-discredited claims that three-to-five million illegal votes were cast last November.\n",

            "Paragraph: TEL AVIV – Mike Morell, the former acting director of the CIA, is generating headlines for claiming that alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election amounts to \"the political equivalent of 9/11.\" Morell further suggested that the U.S. should respond in a significant way to the alleged Russian actions and he has given interviews supporting reports that the CIA believes Russia tried to influence the election in favor of President-elect Donald Trump. Absent from the news media coverage of Morell’s statements is that he is known for his leading role in helping to craft the infamously misleading talking points used by Obama administration officials to blame the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks on a YouTube video. The news media also failed to mention that Morell, who abruptly resigned from the CIA in June 2013, took a job that year at the Beacon Global Strategies firm, where he still works as senior counselor. Beacon was founded by Phillippe Reines, who served as Communications Adviser to Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. From 2009-2013, Reines also served in Clinton’s State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications.  Reines is the managing director of Beacon. In an interview on Sunday with the Cipher Brief, Morell commented on reports in the Washington Post and New York Times claiming Moscow interfered in the presidential election to help Trump win – a contention the President-elect called \"ridiculous\" in an interview on Sunday. \"It is an attack on our very democracy,\" Morell said. \"It’s an attack on who we are as a people. A foreign government messing around in our elections is, I think, an existential threat to our way of life. To me, and this is to me not an overstatement, this is the political equivalent of 9/11. It is huge and the fact that it hasn’t gotten more attention from the Obama administration, Congress, and the mainstream media, is just shocking to me.\" Morell further asserted that the U.S. must respond overtly to the attack: He stated: The third implication is we need to respond to the Russian attack. We need to deter the Russians and anyone else who is watching this—and you can bet your bottom dollar that the Chinese, the North Koreans, the Iranians are all watching. We need to deter all of those folks from even thinking about doing something like this in the future. I think that our response needs to have two key pieces to it. One is it’s got to be overt. It needs to be seen. A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect. If you can’t see it, it’s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others, so it’s got to be seen. The second is that it’s got to be significant from Putin’s perspective. He has to feel some pain, he has to pay a price here or, again, there will be no deterrence, and it has to be seen by the rest of the world as being significant to Mr. Putin so that it can be a deterrent. The interview with Morell was widely cited by the news media. \"Former Acting CIA Director Calls Russian Interference In Election ‘The Political Equivalent Of 9/11,’\" reads a Huffington Post headline. Business Insider ran a piece similarly titled, \"Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell: Russian meddling in US election ‘is the political equivalent of 9/11.’\" \"Ex-CIA Director: Obama Should Retaliate To Russian Election Hacks Now,\" blasted a Forbes.com headline. Morell’s quotes were cited by USA Today, the Independent and scores of other publications. Morell also appeared Monday on \"CBS This Morning,\" where he supported a CBS News report citing intelligence sources saying the CIA has high confidence that the Russians attempted to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. \"The C.I.A. doesn’t come to a high-confidence judgment just based on circumstantial evidence. So I think they’ve got more here,\" Morell told the news network. \"I think they’ve got sources who are actually telling them what the intent was.\" The breathless news media coverage of Morell’s recent remarks, reviewed by this reporter, fails to mention Morell’s employment at the firm tied to Hillary Clinton. The coverage of Morell’s remarks also fails to take note of his central role in crafting misleading talking points on the Benghazi attacks. The talking points were used by United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice on Sunday, Sept. 16, 2012, when she appeared on five morning television programs to discuss the White House response to the Benghazi attacks. In nearly identical statements, she asserted that the attacks were a spontaneous protest in response to a \"hateful video.\" Morell addressed his role in editing the talking points during Benghazi testimony on April 4, 2014. The Guardian reported: In his testimony, Morell said he was deeply troubled by allegations made by lawmakers and some in the media \"that I inappropriately altered and influenced CIA’s classified analysis and its unclassified talking points about what happened in Benghazi, Libya in September 2012 and that I covered up those actions.\" \"These allegations accuse me of taking these actions for the political benefit of President Obama and then secretary of state Clinton. These allegations are false,\" Morell said. He said he and the agency could have done a better job, but he dismissed suggestions that the CIA \"cooked the books\" in the assessment of the attack. In a briefing to senators following the attacks, Morell claimed that references to terrorism and al-Qaeda were removed from the Benghazi talking points to \"prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation.\" Morell’s assertions were contradicted by a 46-page House Republican report from April 2013 finding the talking points were edited to protect the State Department’s reputation. \"Contrary to administration rhetoric, the talking points were not edited to protect classified information,\" states the \"Interim Progress Report for the Members of the House Republican Conference on the Events Surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi.\" \"Evidence rebuts administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\" the report states, charging the talking points were \"deliberately\" edited to \"protect the State Department.\" States the report: \"To protect the State Department, the administration deliberately removed references to al-Qaeda-linked groups and previous attacks in Benghazi in the talking points used by [United Nations] Ambassador [Susan] Rice, thereby perpetuating the deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a demonstration caused by a YouTube video.\" Morell resigned from the CIA amid the controversy surrounding the Benghazi attacks, saying he was stepping down to spend more time with his family. Morell, who was considered a favorite to lead the CIA and spent 33 years with the agency, acknowledged in his resignation statement that the reason for his leaving the agency may seem somewhat difficult to believe, but \"when I say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that.\" \"I am passionate about two things in this world – the agency and my family,\" Morell said in the statement. \"And while I have given everything I have to the Central Intelligence Agency and its vital mission for a third of a century, it is now time for me to give everything I have to my family.\" Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

            "Paragraph: The scent of lavender is known for its soothing properties, and for this reason is often recommended to people as a relaxation or sleep aid. But according to new research, the calming scent can also make us more trusting of others. \"Our results might have various serious implications for a broad range of situations in which interpersonal trust is an essential element,\" Leiden psychologist Roberta Sellaro said in a statement. \"Smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car, or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products. The smell of lavender may also be helpful in sport psychology to enhance trust and build team spirit, for example in the case of team games such as soccer and volleyball.\" To investigate the flower's effect on trust, Leiden University researchers exposed one group of study participants to the scent of lavender and another group to peppermint. Then, the participants were asked to play a game that is commonly used in experimental settings to measure how much one subject trusts another. In the game, a \"trustor\" was given 5 Euros and instructed to decide how much of that money to give a \"trustee\" in each round. The trustee, in return, could decide to split the money with the trustor. If the trustee gave the trustor enough money in return, he or she would receive additional money. After being exposed to lavender, participants gave significantly more money to the trustee (3.9 Euro) than those who had been exposed to peppermint (3.23 Euro). The findings \"reinforce the idea that interpersonal trust is sensitive to situational and environmental factors,\" the researchers note. Previous research on aromatherapy has found that lavender can affect mood and well-being. Lavender essential oil produces a mild calming and sedative affect, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center, and has been used to ease anxiety, depression, insomnia and fatigue. One brain-scanning study by Wesleyan University researchers found that participants who sniffed lavender oil before going to bed slept more soundly through the night.\n",

            "Paragraph: In December 2012, when Michelle Schroeder-Gardner graduated with an MBA, she had $38,000 in student loan debt. She got a job as a financial analyst earning $50,000 a year (plus bonuses of about $12,500 annually), but she set a goal of paying off her debt within six months. Though it took her one extra month, paying off a huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over-achievement. Since then, she has increased her income each year. In 2013, excluding her salary from her full-time job, which she quit that year, she earned $117,000. In 2014, that increased to $164,000. In 2015, her earnings jumped to $321,000. And last year, she made just shy of $1 million   $979,000, to be exact. Plus, the 27-year-old is a digital nomad. She and her husband live in an RV, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in Arizona when we spoke in late January) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including Colorado National Monument, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Arches, Moab, and others. Her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports. Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of the Making Sense of Cents blog and her husband, Wesley Gardner (Courtesy of Michelle Schroeder-Gardner) It also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says. But the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive. I've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems. Growing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm. Here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly. How did you pay off your student loans so quickly? Six months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later. So in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things. As soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it. What were your expenses during this time? My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills. When did the blog start coming into the picture? I had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs. I started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money. Until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me. My advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course. I also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community. How much did you earn from the blog to begin with? In the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month. How exactly does the blog bring in money? Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform. The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done. My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms. Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016? In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others. By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%. I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income. I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000. How has your changing income changed your lifestyle? As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time. The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever. Why did you start living in an RV? My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was. But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since. How big was your house?  We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms. How big is the RV? It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out. Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff? Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums. How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's? It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money. We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long. How has all this newfound wealth changed you? I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it. How has your wealth changed your relationships? It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth. How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood?  My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them. I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long. How much time do you spend on your blog? Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week. Do you have help? I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it. What do you do with your extra income?  We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon. For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible.\n",

            "Topic: 1 Brilliantly Simple Hiring Question That Will Tell You Instantly if Someone Is a Dreamer or a Doer\n",
            "Paragraph: Whether you're hiring a partner, sizing up a colleague, or just trying to get to know someone, asking a very simple question will tell you more about how innovative the person is than virtually anything else you can ask. Innovation Is Not Just About Talent I have to admit at the outset that when I hire senior-level people whom I expect to be innovative it is never just because of talent, brains, or even skills. Figuring out if they have the competency to do the job is actually pretty easy (see my article \" 6 Interview Questions You Must Ask if You Want to Hire the Best People \"). What is infinitely harder to judge is the degree to which they are truly innovative and committed to their ideas. The challenge, of course, is that many people can make a great first impression--but end up being someone totally different when you have to live with them eight to 12 hours a day. I've seen the strain that the wrong partnership can have. What starts off as a blissful union can turn into a nightmare when the underlying values and ambitions of partners don't align. Bringing on board a senior-level individual in a small business is crucial and will have a deep, long-term impact on your company. And partnerships are so hellish to untangle that companies can be ruined in the process. So you really need to get it right from the outset. But you can only assess compatibility and a commitment to innovation through experience, right? Wrong! You can get immense insight into a person's drive, commitment, innovative ability, and even loyalty by asking one utterly simple question. And here's the key: The actual content of his or her answer is interesting but irrelevant! What counts is how someone answers the question. In fact, this technique is so powerful that I've often used it when talking to people I've just met to get a sense for who they are and how they operate. Yes, I'm not much for small talk. Let's just dive into the deep end! The Commitment to Innovation Lie Detector Test I call this my commitment to innovation lie detector test. It's not foolproof, but it's good enough to give you what you need in order to understand how committed someone is to achieving his or her ambitions rather than just dreaming about them. First, here's the question I lead with (Stick with me after you read it, because there is a plot twist here that's critical if you're going to use this technique effectively): \"What are three things you have not yet accomplished that you would never forgive yourself for not having accomplished during the remainder of your life?\" Before you read on, stop and make a mental list of those three things for yourself. Got them? Now read on. Here's the twist. It's a follow-up question. OK, I know I said one question, but I wanted to set you up in the same way I'd set this up in an interview. I don't want the candidate to know that I'm going to ask a follow-up because it's the answer to the follow-up that I care most about. Frankly, within this context, the three things someone has listed are interesting but meaningless to me. Not because they're unimportant, but because we're all entitled to have whatever dreams of grandeur we want. It's the intentional strategies and tactics to achieve them that I want to hear about--that's what tells me who someone really is, how well he or she deals with uncertainty, how sincere the person is about his or her ambitions, and ultimately how innovative the person is. We can all dream; coming up with new ideas is simple. The world does not lack in dreamers, but some of us actually do something about those dreams. And, by the way, doing something isn't just about making a decision; those are easy too. Anyone can decide, but just because you've decided to start a business, become rich, get married, or have kids doesn't make you an entrepreneur, a millionaire, a good spouse, or a good parent. It's what you do after the decision that counts. So here's the follow-up question: \"Specifically, what have you done in the past 30 days to realize each of those three ambitions?\" What I'm looking for are specifics. If you respond immediately with actual tasks, projects, and measurable, tangible efforts, then I'm impressed. I want to see the numbers! How much are you doing? How often? If you have to think about it, then I'm worried, because, after all, you just told me that these were the three most important things in your life. And you're not doing anything specific to realize them? Really? Anything less than direct quantifiable and tangible effort to achieve these three ambitions tells me that the person I'm talking to lacks adequate discipline and self-direction. Most important, it tells me that this is someone who isn't accustomed to doing the hard work it takes to realize his or her dreams. Instead, the person expects that just deciding on having the dream is sufficient. By the way, there's a name for that. It's called entitlement, and it's the last thing I want from someone on my team, especially a senior-level hire! I want the person to know what it means to earn success rather than expecting it to be handed over! Entitlement is what destroys relationships and partnerships. Entitled people simply expect to be right, are regularly frustrated and blame others for their shortcomings, rarely take ownership of their actions, anger, temper, and reactions to others, have a short fuse and get exasperated easily, and are not transparent--in short they make lousy partners because they're usually too busy arguing about who's right rather than what's right. Innovative people don't care about who's right; they care about what's right. My suggestion is that you start using this technique not only in interview settings but with your interpersonal relationships as well. You'll find that it provides an incredibly powerful way to determine if your ambitions and commitment to a shared vision of the future are aligned with a colleague, friend, or partner or your spouse. Oh, by the way, you did have quantifiable and tangible activities that supported the three items you said would never forgive yourself for not accomplishing, right? Please, tell me you did.\n",

            "Topic: 4th Grader Comes Home With Disturbing News—Then Mom Realizes Her \"Worst Nightmare\" Is Coming True\n",
            "Paragraph: I will never forget the day my daughter told me that Bethany, a girl in her 4th grade class, was annoying her. \"What is she doing to you?\" I questioned, instinctively protective. \"She’s following me around on the playground and sitting by me at lunch!\" she quipped, as if that would sum things right up and get me squarely on her side of the matter. \"You mean she’s trying to be friends with you?\" I asked incredulously. I realized immediately that I had a problem on my hands. I was raising my own worst nightmare. Smack dab in the middle of my brood of five kids, was a charismatic, sassy, leggy, blonde, dance-y, athletic girl oozing confidence ... and apparently annoyance, directed toward another little girl that wasn’t lucky enough to be her. Inconveniently for my daughter, her own mother WAS Bethany in grade school. Freckled of face and frizzy of hair, I was an Army brat, always the new girl clamoring for a friend, drawn to the natural confidence of girls like my daughter. This conversation found me vacillating between heartache and fury, but one thing I knew for sure: Mama was about to put her money where her mouth had been all these years. The battle of two very strong wills ensued at my home the next morning. It wasn’t pretty, but I prevailed. My daughter attended a private Catholic grade school, where on any given day, she and a handful of her cohorts ruled the roost. One quick phone call to Bethany’s mother that same evening confirmed my worst fears. My daughter and her posse were using everything short of a can of \"Cling Free\" to rid themselves of the annoying Bethany. I’m sure there are parents out there who will say I overreacted. But, I firmly believe we’ve got to start to address our country’s bullying epidemic right at the heart; by re-defining bullying at its very core. To me, the rejection and complete lack of interest my daughter and her \"clique\" displayed toward Bethany was the beginning of a subtle type of bullying. It is true (confirmed to me by Bethany’s mom and teachers), that there was no overt unkindness or name-calling, etc., just rejection; a complete lack of interest in someone they wrongly concluded had nothing to offer them. After experiencing childhood myself and raising five of my own, I’ve been on every side of the bullying social dynamic, and I am convinced this is where it begins. A casual assessment and quick dismissal of an outsider. We would serve our children well, in my opinion, if we had a frank conversation with them about Social Darwinism and what motivates human beings to accept and reject others. It happens at every age and stage of life, race, creed and religion. It has its roots in our own fears of rejection and lack of confidence. Everyone is jockeying for their own spot on the Social Food Chain. I feel like I have experienced demonstrable success with my children by tabling this dynamic right out in the open. Parents need to call it by name, speak it out loud, shine a bright light in its ugly face. We need to admit to our children that we too experience this, even as adults. Of course it’s tempting to ‘curry favor’ and ‘suck-up’ to the individual a rung of two above you on the Social Ladder, but every single human being deserves our attention and utmost respect. In spite of this, we have to constantly remind our children and ourselves that everyone can bring unexpected and unanticipated value to our lives. But we have to let them. It’s simply not enough to instruct your children to \"Be Nice!\" You’ve got to be more specific than that. Kids think if they aren’t being outright unkind, they are being nice. We know better. Connect the ugly dots. Explain the Darwinistic social survival instinct that’s often motivating and guiding their impulses. I promise you, they can handle it. They already see it on some level anyway. They just need YOU to give it a voice and re-direction. As for my girl, I instructed her that she was going to invest some time and energy getting to know Bethany. I assigned her to come home from school the next day and report three cool things she found out about Bethany, that she didn’t previously know. My strong-willed child dug in. She did not want to do that. I dug in deeper. I refused to drive her to school the next morning, until she agreed. It seemed that, at least until now, I had the car keys and the power. Her resistance gave us time to have the Social Darwinism conversation. I walked her through my \"ATM Machine Analogy.\" I explained to her that she had social bank to spare. She could easily make a withdrawal on behalf of this little girl, risking very little. \"Let’s invest!\" I enthused and encouraged. She got dressed reluctantly and I drove her to school. She had a good day—what was left of it. But, she was still buggy with me when I picked her up, telling me that her friends’ mothers \"stay out of such matters\" and let their daughters \"choose their own friends!\" (Such wise women.) And then she told me three cool things about Bethany that she didn’t previously know. I checked back in with Bethany’s mother by phone two weeks later. It’s called follow through. (I don’t think enough of us are doing that. We \"helicopter\" over our kids’ wardrobes, nutrition, sleep schedules, hygiene, science fair projects and then pride ourselves on how \"hands off\" we are on social issues. If I had a dollar for every time I wanted to say, \"Seriously? You micro-manage the literal crap out of every thing your child does from his gluten intake to his soccer cleats, but THIS you stay out of?\" No wonder there’s zero accountability and a bullying culture!) Bethany’s mother assured me that she had been welcomed into the fold of friendship and was doing well. Bethany’s family moved to another state a few years later. My daughter cried when they parted ways. They still keep in touch through all their social media channels. She was and is a really cool girl, with a lot to offer her peers. But the real value was to my daughter, obviously. She gained so much through that experience. She is now a 20-year-old college sophomore, with a widely diverse group of friends. She is kind, inclusive and open to all types of people. When she was malleable, impressionable and mine to guide: —She learned her initial instinct about people isn’t always correctly motivated. —She learned you can be friends with the least likely people; the best friendships aren’t people that are your \"type!\" In the world of friendship, contrast is a plus. —She learned that there are times, within a given social framework, that you are in a position to make a withdrawal on behalf of someone else. Be generous, invest! It pays dividends. But, most importantly, she learned that, while I may not be overly-interested in what she gets on her Science Fair project, couldn’t care less if she’s Lactose Intolerant or whether her long blonde hair is snarled, she’s going to damn well treat people right. Parents—your kids are going to eventually develop the good sense to wear a jacket and eat vegetables, invest your energy in how they interact within society.

            "Paragraph: Raising kids gets expensive, and quickly. The average American family pays over $11,000 just in the first year of a child's life, and nearly $250,000 by the time they're 18. And while most of the incurred expenses prove worthwhile, not every toy, class, or experience warrants its price tag. So how can you decipher when it's worth it to splurge? Business Insider asked parents with children of all ages to weigh in on the financial side of having kids.  Not every parent went into their reasoning, but every family is different, and it makes sense that every expense would be valued differently, too. Below, we've anonymously included 16 things they say are totally worth the cash: \"A good babysitter [or] a regular part-time nanny for both working and stay-at-home parents is so worth the investment in your time and sanity. I've seen parents struggle through with two-hour windows of time away from their kids here and there, (it's hardly enough time to go grocery shopping, let alone shower and go for a run) or evenings where you don't get your first alone time until 9:40 at night. Having help five to 10 hours a week to pick up from school and help with dinner, tubs, and the occasional load of laundry is priceless.\" Orthodontics \"Life insurance gives me peace of mind knowing if something happened to me or my partner, there would be financial resources available to help care for our kids.\" \"Child care. It is expensive, but well worth the cost for me to know that my child is getting great care in an environment that encourages her development. As a parent, that is pretty priceless.\" \"I used to think child care was just a fancy babysitting service. My daughter and son are exposed to many more activities and peers than their stay-at-home cousins. When we're all together the differences are quite clear.\" \"I think it's worth it to spend on a few well-chosen extracurricular activities. My son does fencing and takes music lessons. I think these are worthwhile because they teach him focus and help him learn different skills and interests.\" Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts Summer camp Music lessons Family vacations A breast pump. \"It gave me more freedom as a mom, and I couldn't have continued working (and earning for my family) without it.\" Nursing pillow Good bottles A baby bouncer A decent mattress \"College tuition and spending money on educational resources, tutoring, and private school was totally worth the money.\" Studying abroad\n",

            "Paragraph: Melissa McCarthy's Elle cover, part of the magazine's Women in Hollywood cover series, features a striking gray winter coat, a voluminous woolen piece by Marina Rinaldi with a dramatic cut. But the fashionable garment isn't having quite the impact the editors likely anticipated. When McCarthy's cover debuted last week, critics were quick to point out that the other November cover girls, including Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, were all styled in body-conscious outfits that flashed some skin. McCarthy, on the other hand, was dressed in a coat \"so huge,\" wrote Slate, \"that she could hide her Mike and Molly co-star Billy Gardel underneath.\" Today, Elle has responded to the critics, defending its styling choices with the following statement: \"On all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. We are thrilled to honor her as one of our Women in Hollywood this year.\" Fashion magazines have long been accused of treating their curvier cover models differently than their stick-thin celeb cover girls. Vogue was hit with backlash in 2009 over an Adele shoot that showed her sprawled nearly facedown on a bed, her shape obscured; Vogue UK was faced with similar criticism over its Adele cover in 2011, which zoomed in on the singer's face so closely it cropped out her neck. In fact, Elle faced similar accusations in 2010 with another series of covers. Back then, instead of Melissa McCarthy, Gabourey Sidibe was the curvy girl in the bunch; instead of Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, the other cover girls were Megan Fox, Lauren Conrad and Amanda Seyfried. The latter three were photographed from the knees up, showing off their full outfits, while Sidibe's cover photo was cropped at her chest. Then, just as they did today, the folks at Elle denied any ill intent and said their choices for both photography and fashion styling were purely artistic. Do you agree?\n",

            "Paragraph: One piece of NASA’s massive new rocket NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562041 Space adventure fans might enjoy NASA’s latest saga, the story of a rocket to nowhere that Congress wants, very badly, built in Alabama. Or they might be really pissed off. In its 2017 budget request, NASA asked Congress for $1.3 billion to build its next jumbo rocket. Last week, despite years of fighting with the Obama Administration over its plans to explore an asteroid with the rocket, the Senate Appropriations Committee not only granted the request, but gave the space agency an extra $995 million to build it. A surprise billion dollars may sound good. But while adding money to \"Space Operations,\" the Appropriations Committee also cut $660 million from NASA’s science, aeronautics, and space technology programs that build the telescopes, observatories, planes, and landers that make the agency so beloved. In justifying this decision, the committee wrote that the rocket \"is the nation’s launch vehicle that will enable humans to explore space beyond current capabilities.\" The futuristic space rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), won’t send any astronauts into space until at least 2023, and it doesn’t even have a destination. But that doesn’t seem to matter to lawmakers. Since the moon landings ended, NASA is and has always been a jobs program, more about dollars spent on the ground than discoveries made among the stars, with the SLS bonanza just the latest example. \"It is more the politics of pork than the politics of progress,\" former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told BuzzFeed News. \"There’s a long-time pattern at NASA where money aimed at science and research ends up with builders and contractors instead.\" Ratana Meekham, a technician at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562047 The Senate space spending committee is headed by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, and on the minority side by Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, both of whom have NASA centers in their states. The SLS (nicknamed the \"Senate Launch System\" after it was forced on NASA in 2010), will be built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama, where a $45 million 15-story test stand for the rocket reached its intended height earlier this month. \"The point is to spend money and create jobs the way the Soviet Union did on its rocket design bureaus,\" Keith Cowing of NASA Watch told BuzzFeed News. The SLS — \"a rocket to nowhere,\" as Cowing put it — fits this pattern neatly because it provides thousands of jobs in space states. No one knows where it will go. Maybe to an asteroid (the Obama administration’s unloved notion), or to circle the moon, or boost astronauts on their way to Mars. Eric Berger, a reporter at Ars Technica decried the move to build the rocket ahead of a destination. Cuts also came to NASA’s \"space technology\" funding, a $130 million bite meant to keep aloft earth-observing satellites run out of Goddard Space Flight Center, based in Mikulski’s state of Maryland. As Berger said, \"the motivation seems primarily to be keeping people employed.\" One problem with this approach is that you might end up with space rocket that doesn’t have any space technology — a habitat module, deep-space propulsion, landers — to actually let astronauts voyage to asteroids, or the moon, or Mars. You might spend billions on workers who maintain the rocket you’ve built, and not have any money left over to build the interplanetary survival gear needed to ever get to Mars, the ultimate goal of the space agency. It’s happened before, Garver said, with the the $100 billion International Space Station. \"We had to spend all the money just to get it built, with very little left for science.\" Scientists have long complained how little research takes place on the orbiting lab. NASA’s scientific advisory committee decided only this month to send a fact-finding group to the foundation that manages ISS research, after questioning its scientific productivity. NASA Watch / Keith Cowing / Via nasawatch.com ID: 8562044 \"The critics are right, this isn’t a rational way to run a space program,\" political science professor Harry Lambright of Syracuse University told BuzzFeed News. \"But that doesn’t matter, because this is the way a space program will inevitably work in a democracy.\" So it has always been for NASA, born in a moment of Cold War lunacy over the Soviet Union claiming the moon for communism, and looking for another space race to justify its budget ever since the glamour of Moon landings first wore off. In the 1960s, NASA administrator James Webb faced declining popular interest in the moon landing, responded by spreading NASA centers to politically important states, such as Lyndon Johnson’s Texas, California, Ohio, and Florida. NASA’s Stennis Space Center, which will build the rocket engines powering the SLS, is located in Mississippi, home to the chairman of the Senate’s overall spending committee, Sen. Thad Cochran. In a sense, that system is still working. NASA built the space shuttle in the 1970s in a decision largely shaped by Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign. Since then, the space agency has had to compete for Congressional dollars like every other federal agency, which means that politicians will always look to jobs as a reason for any Mars landings, Lambright said. \"They can’t spend money that Congress doesn’t give them.\" So, NASA will at least get a rocket out of the deal, he and others argue. \"NASA is actually doing a very good job, in my view, of navigating to build a rocket while they can,\" Lambright said. \"That is what there is money to build.\" The real problem, former NASA official Scott Pace of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News, is that the Obama administration’s plans to fly astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars are not very interesting to international or commercial partners, who would rather return to the moon. Building SLS lets NASA keep its options open if the next president decides to look to lunar landings instead, something that Obama seemed to rule out in a 2010 speech. Meanwhile, one commercial partner of NASA appears very much interested in Mars. SpaceX has announced that it will land an unmanned Dragon astronaut capsule on the Red Planet as early as 2018. That landing would depend on its yet-to-be-produced Falcon Heavy rocket, one almost as powerful as the SLS, carrying the capsule to Mars. Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018. Red Dragons will inform overall Mars architecture, details to come — SpaceX (@SpaceX) ID: 8562055 That’s the same SpaceX that on April 8 demonstrated unparalleled rocket landing capabilities, by dropping one of its Falcon rockets onto an ocean barge after sending a satellite into orbit. Might SpaceX privately building a big rocket in the next two years, and sending something to Mars, make SLS look redundant to politicians, finally ending NASA’s long cycle of rocket-building jobs programs? \"That’s kind of optimistic, and I’m an optimist,\" said Garver, who served as a space policy advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008. \"I wouldn’t count on it.\" An artist’s rendering of the finished SLS NASA / Via nasa.gov ID: 8562049 ID: 8562045 4.

            "Paragraph: Until recently, doctors and scientists have quietly declined to engage in the \"How to prevent a hangover\" discussion, and the reasons they have for doing so are logical. First of all, hangovers aren’t killing anyone, so there’s no sense of dread or looming obligation to fix the issue. Secondly, hangovers (ostensibly) keep people from over-indulging in alcohol, which is a good thing, and create a sort of intrinsic deterrent from overindulging. But in refusing to so much as poke at the issue, the absence of academic discussion of what causes (or prevents) a hangover has led to a jumble of pseudoscience, anecdotal remedies, and outright nonsense. Wanting to hang his hat on some progress on this front, Richard Stephens oat Keel University created the Alcohol Hangover Research Group, which sounds like a nickname for a fraternity, but is actually a collective of scientists and doctors working to figure this thing out. While it’s still not definitively proven, it’s believed that hangovers come as a result of the chemistry of the drinks. Fermentation of alcohol creates congeners that poison us. It’s believed that darker liquors contain more congeners, which actually lend liquors their color, to a degree. So the notion of \"clearer drink, clearer head\" holds up...to a point. Regardless of what you imbibe, the alcohol is broken down to an acetate and the metabolites trigger sickness, sweating, and lethargy. You also suffer inflammation because your body thinks you’re warding off sickness. That inflammation also can lead to those notaries headaches. These are chemical functions of metabolizing alcohol, and very little can be done to circumvent them for a pain-free morning. But if that’s the case, then why do 23% of people, as found in this study, claim to never suffer hangovers? Are one in four people lying? Not likely. It’s probable that those immune to the nasty morning-after effects are genetically predisposed to doing so. Studies have shown that twins have a tendency to share this trait much more than two unrelated people do. So, unfortunately, if you’ve experienced a severe hangover before, you’re likely not among those immune, and barring some serious genetic work, you never will be. You can take a page out of the playbook from many who suffer from lessened hangovers, though, by pacing yourself. It’s been found that those who drink for long periods of time but regulate their consumption to hover around .10% suffer far less in the way of hangovers than those who get a more aggressive with their booze intake. Stephens says that the belief that hangovers get worse as you get older is a fallacy as well, stating, \"It’s a very commonly held perception that we suffer worse hangovers as we get older, but there’s no evidence for it. Hangovers are largely a young person’s problem.\" He attributes this to older folks knowing how much to drink and how to pace, whereas younger people do not or choose not to. As those looking for a surefire cure may have feared, common sense remains the most effective weapon in fighting hangovers. Don’t drink too much, and you won’t get one. But that almost certainly won’t stop people from crafting their own cures and theories in the hopes that hangovers are something that can be beaten. But this suggestion of an edible stinkbug helping your hangover might be an instance of a cure being worse than the disease. It COULD turn you off of drinking for a lifetime, though, which may solve the problem.\n",

            "Topic: Is Buying Organic Really Worth It?\n",
            "Paragraph: Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it? Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic. Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said. Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones. Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? What the heck does organic mean anyway? Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed. \"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email. When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says \"100 percent organic\" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. \"Organic,\" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while \"made with organic ingredients\" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients. There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an \"excuse to charge more.\" Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are. Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not. A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and \"substantially higher\" levels of antioxidants. Other ways of measuring \"worth\": When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too. \"When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,\" she told HuffPost. \"Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.\" According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health. But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit. Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation. Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large. \"Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,\" he said. \"It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.\" According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers. \"Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,\" the nonprofit writes. Many organic farms are small operations, though \"big organic\" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce. Organic on a budget Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just \"buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.\" And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply): 1. Prioritize your purchases. \"It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,\" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post. She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible. \"Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,\" she said. Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. \"The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,\" said Lu. For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable. \"Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,\" said Gerszberg. The Environmental Working Group's \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen\" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The \"clean\" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower. 2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce. Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative. \"The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,\" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. \"Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.\" Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation. It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less. 3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too. Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products. 4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals. 5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience. Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. Live in a small apartment? The Urban Organic Gardener website's got you covered. The bottom line So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key. And if you're not able to pay for that fancy, organic apple, a fear of pesticides shouldn't be a barrier to consuming lots of nutritious produce. \"Eating fruits and vegetables is good for health, whether organic or not,\" said Nestle.\n",

            "Paragraph: While many large companies use automated résumé-screener software to cut down the initial pool of job applicants, loading your résumé with meaningless buzzwords and phrases is not the smartest way to get noticed. \"Nearly everyone is guilty of using buzzwords from time to time, but professionals are evaluated increasingly on their ability to communicate,\" says Paul McDonald, senior executive director for professional-placement firm Robert Half. Some of the major problems with using buzzwords, according to Mary Lorenz, a corporate-communications manager at CareerBuilder, are that they have become so overused that they've lost all meaning, and they don't differentiate the job seeker from other candidates because they're so generic. Other, less jargony words and terms should be avoided when they serve little purpose to the hiring manager. All these words do is waste space and the reader's time and, as a result, you lose out on the few precious seconds a recruiter spends scanning your résumé. Instead, Lorenz says job seekers should speak in terms of accomplishments and show rather than tell. \"Avoiding overused terms can help job seekers convey their message and stand out from the crowd,\" McDonald says. Here are some words and phrases you should avoid: 1. 'Leadership' According to LinkedIn, \"leadership\" was the top buzzword on its user's profiles. And if the word doesn't help you stand out on your LinkedIn profile, you can bet it won't make your résumé more eye-catching, either. Rather than saying you have excellent leadership skills, you'd do better to highlight specific examples of when you demonstrated these skills and what kind of results you saw. 2. 'Exceptional communicator' Tina Nicolai, who has read more than 40,000 résumés since founding her company Résumé Writers' Ink, tells Business Insider that skills like being an \"exceptional communicator\" are \"baseline expectations in today's market.\" Stating that you are really great at communication isn't, in fact, saying very much. 3. 'Best of breed' When CareerBuilder surveyed more than 2,200 hiring managers, it found \"best of breed\" to be the most irritating term to be seen on a résumé.

'Responsible for' Superfluous words like \"responsible for,\" \"oversight of,\" and \"duties included\" unnecessarily complicate and hide your experience, says Alyssa Gelbard, founder and president of Résumé Strategists. \"Be direct, concise, and use active verbs to describe your accomplishments,\" she suggests. Instead of writing, \"Responsible for training interns ...,\" simply write, \"Train interns ...\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Annabelle Breakey/Getty Images Why So Delicious? It's largely about how it feels in the mouth. Once a piece of cheddar has been heated to around 150°F, the matrix of milk proteins that provide its structure begins to break down, and the cheese takes on a creamy texture that many people find appealing. What defines creaminess, and why do people find it so appetizing? That's a mystery. But a group of scientists based in the Netherlands, using experimental vanilla custard, found that the dessert's creaminess depends on factors including its viscosity, homogeneity, and texture and surface appearance. One of the scientists, René de Wijk of Wageningen UR's Food & Biobased Research division, says test subjects were especially inclined toward custards that produce lower friction in the mouth. The same factors may apply to cheese, de Wijk says. Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, adds that the warmth of melted cheese provides its own source of pleasure. Taken together, all the sensations associated with melted cheese—smoothness, gooeyness, and warmth—connote a fatty treat. And humans love fat. Ivan de Araújo, a researcher at Yale, has studied how the nervous system responds to fatty foods. Possibly as a result of evolution or individual learning, he says, receptors in our mouths are keyed in to the texture of oily, calorie-dense foods. \"And that perception may be an indicator, either innate or not,\" he says, \"of the presence of fat.\" tl;dr: Our nervous system is stimulated by creamy textures.\n",

            "Paragraph: Got a chic flapper dress in your wardrobe? Then you're all set for Halloween. Google's stats show that \"Great Gatsby\" costumes, inspired by this year's blockbuster movie, are among the top 10 costumes for Halloween 2013. According to Google Shopping's data, the top trending costume searches for this year's holiday are: Minion costume Breaking Bad costume Fox costume Duck Dynasty costume Miley Cyrus costume Minecraft costume Daenerys costume Batman costume Gatsby dress costume Daft Punk costume Hooray for no sexy nurses/cats/policemen? The data, which reflects searches on Google Shopping, indicate this year is all about the 2013 memes and cult shows. We already assumed we'd see plenty of twerking Mileys and even some Batmans in anticipation of the new movie; but dressing up as the little yellow Minions from \"Despicable Me\" or the Fox from the \"What Does the Fox Say?\" video demonstrates an impressive commitment to pop culture, we'd say. Same goes for \"Breaking Bad\" costumes. At least Daenerys from \"Game Of Thrones\" has a look that can be easily recreated with an icy wig; Walter and Jesse from \"Breaking Bad,\" on the other hand, are probably more challenging to imitate accurately in costume form. That would probably explain why people are Googling it so much -- Google notes that searches for \"Breaking Bad\" costumes are three times higher this year, on the heels of the series finale, than they were last year. But the easier route, of course, is \"The Great Gatsby.\" Google reports that Gatsby costume searches are trending highest in New York and California, where we bet lots of stylish gals probably own Gatsby-like dresses and accessories anyway. Which just solved our \"what to be for Halloween\" problem. Thanks for the idea, Google.\n",

            "Paragraph: Small change, big difference. 1. If you have 3 minutes: Relax with rain sounds. I love RainyMood for some soothing white noise. You can download it as an app, but I like to just have it open in a tab. 2. If you have 5 minutes: Put pressure on period cramps. Whatever helps, right? 3. If you have 10 minutes: Try scent therapy. Look, maybe this isn't for you, and I appreciate that. But my friend and colleague Emma writes: \"If you don't buy into this, that's cool, but I am 👏 here 👏 for 👏 aromatherapy👏 . I always carry around an essential-oil rollerball in my purse to rub on my pulse points, I'm a huge fan of candles and scented baths, and I also use a pillow spray to help me sleep. Maybe I'm just a creature of luxury, but there's something about the ritual of all these things, and taking the time to focus on lighting a candle or running a bath, that I find intensely relaxing – as well as the actual smell of it.\" 4. If you have 15 minutes: Try a game to keep your brain happy. I love this blog post about ways to distract your brain if you feel you're going to have a panic attack. The author writes: \"One of the things I find most useful to have in my armoury against my anxiety, is these little games I have created for myself. I can play them (mostly) anywhere, anytime and they manage to distract my brain enough to get past the rush of adrenaline which usually means I’m on the Anxiety Express- NEXT STOP PANIC ATTACK!\" 5. If you have 20 minutes: Eat exactly what you fancy. Make something you really want to eat. For example, I'm going to spend Sunday making this Buttermilk Fried Chicken (that's the end result in the picture – I hope that mine will be as delicious). The world's not going to end if you don't eat perfectly every day. 6. If you have 30 minutes: Get an STI check. Part of self-care (for me anyway), is respecting my body enough to look after it – not just fudging along with things that don't feel right. So get an STI check, or a smear test if you're due one. If you're someone who takes contraception, take some time to figure out what the right one for you is. Speaking of, this is a useful piece about what it's like to have an IUD inserted.\n",

Usually, the core of the heat is focused around the hinge of your computer. Taking a stack of coins and lining them up there can actually help cool it down considerably. #9. So how does it work? A Japanese laptop user, Akinori Suzuki, was the one to figure it out. He found that the problem can be solved by simply stacking copper coins on top of your machine, as copper is good at dissipating heat. #10. In his case, he used certain yen coins. But in your case, pennies will definitely do the trick. #11. And luckily, we've all got extra change lying all over the place. Sure, you could buy a cooling desk for your laptop, but why not try using some of the stuff you already have? #12. And if it doesn't work? Well, you have some other options. One of them being that you can use your laptop to cook your breakfast. Talk about making the best out of a bad situation.\n",

            "Paragraph: The Pulitzer Prize has broadened eligibility in feature writing and investigative reporting to include online and print magazines, the Pulitzer Prize Board announced in a press release on Monday. In the past, publications that identified as magazines, either in print or online, were not allowed to compete for a Pulitzer in any category. But as an increasing number of Americans turn to digital media for their daily news, and many print magazines publish weekly and operate their own websites, the decision to broaden the spectrum makes sense. \"Pulitzer’s aim was the progress and elevation of journalism,\" Pulitzer Prize administrator Mike Pride said in a statement. \"He envisioned that future generations would make changes in the Plan of Award for the prizes that are 'conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time.' Increasingly, online and print magazines have expanded their mission. It’s time to enlarge the tent again.\" While websites operated by broadcast news organizations remain ineligible, and the prize continues to be primarily focused on text, the Pulitzer Prize Board acknowledges that the web has provided new and compelling ways for journalists to integrate the written word with multimedia content. \"Consistent with its historical focus on text-based journalism, the Board will continue to place emphasis on the enduring value of words and of serious reporting,\" the press release read, \"while also recognizing the opportunity provided by the web for integration of text with audio and visual elements to strengthen story-telling and provide information and analysis.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: It is the age-old method for cooking Brussels sprouts, handed down the generations and put into practice at least once a year. But it now seems that by cutting a small cross in the base of each sprout all this time, we have all simply been doing it wrongly. And instead of boiling them, we should be steaming, stir-frying or even microwaving Brussels to get that perfectly crunchy consistency. Britain’s top sprout expert has urged the nation’s cooks to reconsider their approach to the Christmas staple whose fortunes are starting to be revived. Matthew Rawson, chairman of the Brassica Growers Association, said: \"Boiling them was traditionally the way of doing it, but putting the cross in puts in too much water. \"They turn soggy and rubbish. People who do that have ruined the Brussels sprout.\" Mr Rawson, who farms in Yorkshire, added: \"People now are learning that it is a very versatile vegetable. The big ones lend themselves well to a stir-fry. People are steaming them, and there are fancy microwave packs. It is being driven forward by people who are more creative.\" He credits the new vogue for dishes such as Brussels sprouts with pancetta and chestnuts or pistachio and pomegranate sprout salad with revitalising the vegetable’s fortunes. \"Brussels sprouts have moved away from the poor little malign Christmas sprout image, and it has seen demand increase,\" he said. \"It’s happened over the last decade. Certainly people do eat more of them – there are a lot more foody programmes on television and foody magazines, and it is there in their subconscious.\" The sprout farmer has teamed up with Aaron Craze, a Youtube cooking star, to set up the website loveyourgreens.co.uk and to promote the wonders of his beloved brassicas. \"The reality was that people who were eating our products were the older generation, and the older generation keep dying so we had to link in with younger generations and mothers,\" said Mr Rawson.  \"It was just another way of experimenting with our product.\" Nicola Knight, an analyst at Horizons, which provides information on the food sector, said sprouts are now seen as a more versatile winter ingredient than just a traditional festive accompaniment.   She said: \"Following on from the recent rise in popularity of spinach and kale, Brussels appear to be the latest vegetable to benefit from growing awareness of the health benefits of leafy greens.  \"We are now seeing them used in soups and salads, and as a topping for burgers and pizza.\" Brussels on pizza?

            "Paragraph: It’s been almost three weeks since Pokémon Go came out, and it already has people talking. It is an incredibly immersive game that blends a virtual world with reality with one goal – to catch them all. And it seems that one man has finally managed to do so. New York resident Nick Johnson recently became the first person to announce to have caught all 142 Pokémon in Pokémon Go. His journey spanned two weeks and involved catching 4,269 Pokémon, hatching 303 and walking 95 miles across New York. It’s a dream he’s had ever since he was a kid, and now he’s the first person to boast a collection of 142 Pokémon. \"I’m an avid Pokémon fan. I played a lot as a kid,\" said Johnson. \"But it wasn’t until I caught 135 Pokémon that I thought I should go for this, and see if I could be the first to catch all of them.\" \"You want to catch ’em all and become a Pokémon master, the childhood dream, but it never really occurred to me I might be the first one to do it until I got pretty close,\" he said. What’s even more impressive is the fact that he managed to catch them all, while holding a job and maintaining a social life. How did he accomplish this feat in such a short time, you might ask? Well, he had to sacrifice sleep, and lots of it. He was moonlighting as a Pokémon hunter when most people were asleep. The hardest Pokémon he’s ever had to catch was a Porygon by the waters in Jersey City. \"It popped up on my radar, so I ordered an Uber and had the guy drive me around until I found it,\" he wrote in a Reddit comment. However, he managed to catch most of his Pokémon in Brooklyn and Manhattan and because of his job, he’s had to go out on the hunt mostly at night. \"Sometimes they got pretty lengthy into the wee hours of the morning,\" he said. \"Fortunately I tend to function well on short sleep over a short period of time. And with a little black tea.\" Even his girlfriend supported his obsession, but not because she enjoyed time alone while he was out catching Pokémon. It was because he agreed to catch Pokémon for her as well. \"I was double-fisting two phones while I was playing,\" he laughed. This is not the end of his journey, however, because there are 151 available Pokémon worldwide, most of which are exclusively available in regions on different continents. He says that in the future he might go on a world Pokémon hunt, but not before he gets some sleep. \"I’m looking to see if I can find a travel company to partner with me or sponsor me,\" he said. \"But now I’m taking a little rest, and catching up on my sleep.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: The commoners of the ancient city of Pompeii may have eaten a varied diet, with the wealthier even dining on giraffe, new research suggests. Remains of food scraps found in the drains of Pompeii, Italy, a Roman city wiped out by a volcano, revealed that the middle- and lower-class residents dined on cheap but healthy foods, while slightly wealthier citizens dined on delicacies. The new findings belie the common belief that the Roman elite dined on exotic delicacies while poor Romans starved on birdseed. \"The traditional vision of some mass of hapless lemmings — scrounging for whatever they can pinch from the side of a street, or huddled around a bowl of gruel — needs to be replaced by a higher fare and standard of living, at least for the urbanites in Pompeii,\" study co-author Steven Ellis, a classics professor at the University of Cincinnati, said in a statement. Pompeii was a bustling Roman city that was buried in ash after the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Ellis and his colleagues excavated about 20 shop fronts near one of the once-bustling gates of Pompeii known as the Portia Stabia. The latrines and cesspits behind the food sellers revealed charred food waste from the kitchens, as well as human waste, that dated as far back as the fourth century B.C., when Pompeii was still in an early stage of development. [Preserved Pompeii: Photos Reveal City in Ash] Along with grains, the waste revealed that the commoners of Pompeii ate a simple, but fairly varied, Mediterranean diet that included lentils, olives, nuts and fish, as well as the odd scrap of salted meat. More upscale restaurants could be distinguished by the wider array of delicacies they served. \"The material from the drains revealed a range and quantity of materials to suggest a rather clear socioeconomic distinction between the activities and consumption habits of each property, which were otherwise indistinguishable hospitality businesses,\" Ellis said. For instance, the drains at a more central property contained traces of imported foods such as shellfish, sea urchin and even a giraffe's leg. \"This is thought to be the only giraffe bone ever recorded from an archaeological excavation in Roman Italy,\" Ellis said. \"How part of the animal, butchered, came to be a kitchen scrap in a seemingly standard Pompeian restaurant not only speaks to long-distance trade in exotic and wild animals, but also something of the richness, variety and range of a nonelite diet.\" The team also found traces of exotic and imported spices that came from far-flung regions such as Indonesia.\n",

            "Paragraph: The first Chinese citizen to deliver a graduation speech at Harvard University wants to know why his mother only knew to light his hand on fire when a poisonous spider bit him. Why wasn't she able to use \"less painful, and less risky treatments\" that already existed? Jiang He, who grew up in a rural village in southern China’s Hunan Province, just received his Ph.D in molecular and cellular biology from Harvard. He explained in his Harvard commencement speech this week that his mom put a chopstick in his mouth, wrapped his hand in wine-soaked cotton, and set it on fire after the spider bit him 15 years ago. It was painful, but the flame actually deactivated proteins in the venom, Jiang said. \"I'm happy to report that my hand is fine,\" he said in his speech Wednesday, but he added, \"I'll continue to be troubled by the unequal distribution of scientific knowledge throughout the world.\" Society has unlocked the human genome, but \"we haven't been so successful in deploying [knowledge] to where it is needed most.\" Jiang appreciated the value of innovation, but he believes there should be more emphasis on distributing the knowledge to those who need it. \"Changing the world doesn't mean everyone has to find the next big thing -- it can be as simple as becoming better communicators and fighting more creative ways to pass on the knowledge,\" he said. Quartz noted that China’s state media outlets have bragged that Jiang was \"making history\" by delivering his speech. The graduate told SixthTone.com that people in his native village were spreading news of his speech on WeChat ahead of the commencement, which shows how technology can help improve the lives of people in rural, remote areas. Society must recognize that the equal distribution of knowledge is a pivotal step of human development and we should work to bring this into reality, Jiang said. \"And if we do that,\" he said, \"then perhaps a teenager in rural China who is bitten by a poisonous spider will no longer have to burn his hand, but will know to seek a doctor instead.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Is Adele A Total Diva?? Adele is an extremely successful English songwriter and performer. Her incredible voice and one of a kind storytelling ability helped her win over the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Thanks to her popularity and tremendous career success, Adele managed to amass a net worth of more than $125 million. If you couldn’t guess, that kind of money can get you pretty much anything, including – of course – a pizza from a pizzaria more than 70 miles away. Yup, the 28 year old sent a resort employee on a 140 mile round trip for a slice of ‘za, and to make matters worse, she didn’t even end up eating it. Before you start judging, let’s back track and hear the full story. Adele is widely known as one of the most down-to-earth entertainers in the industry, but even she is seemingly capable of occasionally acting like a total diva. When the superstar was vacationing at a luxury country estate with her partner and 3-year-old son, she apparently had a craving for some pizza. The resort the couple were staying at had a number of on-call chefs, all of whom are capable of preparing a pizza. In fact, a source told Daily Mail that the resort is equipped with some of the best pizza ovens that money can buy, but Adele wasn’t having any of it. She insisted that a member of the resort staff drive to her favourite restaurant in Kensington, to pick up some pizza there. The Soho Farmhouse has a policy of saying \"yes\" to pretty much every whim of their guests, and Adele made sure to take advantage of the fact. It was 11pm when the singer ordered her take out, and by the time the driver made the trip out to London and back, she and her partner were fast asleep. A roomservice team member pointed out that the pizza was still in its box when the room was cleaned in the morning – rendering the entire late-night trip useless for resort staff. Tabloids all over the world picked up on this story and made quite a big fuss about it, seemingly forgetting that Adele isn’t just a regular person. She is a superstar singer and a multimillionaire, so ordering a pizza from a different city isn’t that big of a deal. After all, the employees were paid for their time. Also, pizza is a rare treat for Adele these days. After returning to the limelight with the release of her third album, it became obvious that the superstar lost some significant weight. In fact, Adele revealed that she follows a strict diet regimen, and a custom workout program – despite hating spending time at the gym.\n",

            "Paragraph: An international team of scientists from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is investigating mysterious signal spikes emitting from a 6.3-billion-year-old star in the constellation Hercules—95 light years away from Earth. The implications are extraordinary and point to the possibility of a civilization far more advanced than our own. The unusual signal was originally detected on May 15, 2015, by the Russian Academy of Science-operated RATAN-600 radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, Russia, but was kept secret from the international community. Interstellar space reporter Paul Gilster broke the story after the researchers quietly circulated a paper announcing the detection of \"a strong signal in the direction of HD164595.\" The mysterious star’s designation is HD164595, and it’s considered to be sun-like in nature with a nearly identical metallic composition to our own star. So far, a single Neptune-like (but warmer) planet has been discovered in its orbit—HD 164595 b. But as Gilster explained, \"There could, of course, be other planets still undetected in this system.\" Decorated Italian SETI researcher and mathematician Claudio Maccone along with Russia’s Nikolai Bursov of the Special Astrophysical Observatory are the principal scientists working on the apparent discovery. They claim that \"permanent monitoring of this target is needed.\" \"The signal conceivably fits the profile for an intentional transmission from an extraterrestrial source,\" said Alan Boyle, author of The Case for Pluto who reported the story for Geekwire. \"In any case, the blip is interesting enough to merit discussion by those who specialize in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\" The signal’s strength indicates that if it in fact came from a isotropic beacon, the power source would have to be built by a Kardashev Type II civilization. (The Kardashev scale is used to determine the progress of a civilization’s technological development by measuring how much energy was used to transmit an interstellar message.) An ‘Isotropic’ beacon means a communication source emitting a signal with equal power in all directions while promoting signal strength throughout travel. In his acclaimed work \"Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations,\" Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev explained that a Type II civilization would be able to harness the energy of their entire host star. The most common hypothetical example of this would be a Dyson Sphere—which is a massive artificial structure that could completely encapsulate a star and transfer the energy to a nearby planet. Basically, if the signal was beamed out into the galaxy without aim or direction, that would require an enormous amount of power to actually be detected. But what if the signal was beamed specifically at our solar system? Well, that would require less energy and could indicate the presence of a Kardashev Type I civilization—meaning that it could be a highly technological, contemporary society that harnesses the solar energy emitted by its local star, much like our planet does with solar panels. This particular civilization’s social structure is theorized to be completely globalized and interconnected. \"The signal is provocative enough that the RATAN-600 researchers are calling for permanent monitoring of this target,\" said Gilster. And that’s exactly what is transpiring. As of last night, the SETI institute is diverting its Allen Telescope Array in northern California to investigate while their counterparts at METI International (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) will use Panama’s Boquete Optical Observatory. The detection of the mysterious signal and the ensuing investigations will be discussed at the IAA SETI Permanent Committee during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on September 27—the same day and location where Elon Musk will reveal his plans to colonize Mars. The Observer will be following up on both these stories from the Congress. Robin Seemangal focuses on NASA and advocacy for space exploration.

While the country was coming to grips with this new phase in the Iraq conflict, President Obama was busy on Facebook, sending videos warning us of his real adversary... climate change.

And Hillary Clinton thinks we don’t even have any ground troops in Iraq. We have thousands.

This hearty stew is made of local veggies, salted meat and aromatic spices. It's a dish prepared cookout-style at social gatherings, where everyone brings something to put into the pot. Scott Neuman for NPR hide caption toggle caption Scott Neuman for NPR Oil down, Grenada's national dish, is a melting pot of its cultural history. This hearty stew is made of local veggies, salted meat and aromatic spices. It's a dish prepared cookout-style at social gatherings, where everyone brings something to put into the pot. Scott Neuman for NPR When describing the cultural history of the Caribbean island of Grenada, it's the cooking pot rather than the melting pot that springs to mind. And there's no better culinary metaphor than \"oil down,\" the peculiarly named national dish of Grenada, a mix of meats and vegetables. Nearly every ingredient in this hearty stew has a unique origin and story to tell: For instance, callaloo, a leafy vegetable somewhat similar in taste to spinach, and the same plant's root, known as dasheen, are indigenous to the Caribbean and were cultivated by Grenada's earliest Amerindian inhabitants. Beginning in the 16th century, bananas came from Asia via European explorers and settlers. A few centuries later, slaves from West Africa were brought here to work in the sugarcane fields, and with them came their tradition of one-pot meals. Pig snout and tails were scraps from the plantation master's house. Salted fish (originally cod) imported from Canada was meant as a cheap source of food for the slaves. So was breadfruit, that starchy, nutrient-packed fruit famously associated with the 1789 \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" This South Pacific staple arrived in the Caribbean on a subsequent expedition led by the hapless Capt. William Bligh. Decades later, turmeric — known locally (and confusingly) as \"saffron\" — was introduced by South Asian immigrants, who themselves were meant to fill the labor vacuum left by emancipation in the 1830s. Although the island nation has been independent from Britain for barely four decades, most Grenadians are quick to note (with a hint of patriotism) that the mélange of colors in oil down are reflected in the country's flag – green for callaloo, red for carrots and gold for the curry-like hue of the turmeric. Enlarge this image Turmeric — known locally as saffron — is mixed into coconut milk and poured over meat in the oil down pot. Scott Neuman for NPR hide caption toggle caption Scott Neuman for NPR Turmeric — known locally as saffron — is mixed into coconut milk and poured over meat in the oil down pot. Scott Neuman for NPR Today, oil down – which gets its name from the layer of coconut oil and meat juices that settle to the bottom of the cooking pot — is a staple at the family table and at special gatherings, during the annual Carnival bacchanal or simply as a weekend feast. \"Oil down is a social thing,\" says Simeon Cornwall, a television producer who has researched the history of the dish for Grenada's National Museum. \"If you're cooking oil down, it's because you have a group of people gathering to eat.\" At such gatherings, everyone brings something to put in the pot, says Karen Hall, the owner of Patrick's Local Home Style Restaurant near the capital, St. George's. At home, it's usually a woman making oil down; however, much like a backyard barbecue in the United States, \"at a block party or a beach party, really whenever there's a bit of excitement, the men like to take over the cooking,\" Hall says with a grin. Even so, the matriarchal line is where the oil down meme gets transmitted. Esther Benoit, a chef at the Dodgy Dock restaurant on Grenada's south side, says for her, it's about the way her mother used to make it. \"Even today, as a professional cook, I am still influenced by how she made it,\" Benoit says. Some of her oldest memories of oil down the dish are about the sibling rivalry with her sister \"over which of us got the most dumplings,\" she says, referring to the dense balls of spindle-shaped dough that are a staple of many Caribbean soups and stews. The actual recipe for oil down, which can vary considerably from household to household, has \"evolved over time,\" notes Shirma Wells of the Grenada Tourism Authority. For example, today some Grenadians prefer to leave out the lesser parts of the pig, she says. \"Conch and crab are thrown in the pot in some families, and there's also a vegetarian version.\" Preparation, though, is not for the faint-of-heart. It takes a village, as demonstrated by a neighborhood gathering I recently attended in the Grenadian town of Belmont. It all begins with identifying ripe breadfruit and knocking it off the tree with a long stick, followed by lots of peeling, chopping and kneading of dumpling dough, culminating in the minimum one-hour of cooking time. It can take up most of a morning or afternoon. However, time isn't the only thing consumed: At the feast I witnessed, the whole process was fueled by liberal doses of high-octane white rum. Enlarge this image This steaming pot of oil down, with callaloo leaves on top, is ready to eat. Scott Neuman for NPR hide caption toggle caption Scott Neuman for NPR This steaming pot of oil down, with callaloo leaves on top, is ready to eat. Scott Neuman for NPR Unlike most stews, in which the ingredients get a thorough mixing during the cooking process, a pot of oil down is \"packed.\" Exactly how to \"pack the pot\" is a matter of taste and tradition, as well as a subject of occasional controversy. Everyone has a different order and method, but usually the breadfruit and meat goes on the bottom, most of the vegetables in the middle, and the callaloo leaves and dumplings on top. The ingredients simmer in situ. A few caveats about this dish: An American palate might be put off by the amount of starch. Oil down could also strike some as a bit salty, but eliminating the sodium-rich fish (or pre-soaking it) will likely rectify that. And unless you live in a town that has a well-stocked international grocery, you will probably have some difficulty finding callaloo and dasheen. For callaloo, you can substitute spinach and the dasheen can simply be left out – alterations that even many Grenadians will grudgingly approve. For breadfruit, yams or potatoes are a decent substitution. The bananas should be green. But still, what about that name that sounds more like a sports massage than a comfort food? \"When tourists see it on the menu, they always ask if it's something that has a lot of oil,\" restaurant owner Hall says with a laugh. \"I admit, it's a tough name.\" Oil Down This recipe is a fairly simple version of oil down, This recipe is a fairly simple version of oil down, courtesy of the official website of the Government of Grenada.

            "Topic: America's 10 Absolute Favorite Places to Shop\n",
            "Paragraph: America’s most visited stores are popular for a variety of reasons. According to data provided by Placed , a consumer habits data service provider that monitors behavior of more than 150,000 American consumers at 150 million locations daily, the most popular brands are primarily in the fast-food, discount retail and pharmacy segments. Half of the most visited retailers are fast-food chains. Placed founder and CEO David Shim explained that while you don’t need household supplies every day, \"three times a day or more you need to eat, so there’s a higher propensity to visit these types of businesses.\" The lower price per transaction at fast-food chains compared to other retailers also helps them to attract consumers, Shim noted. Consumers also regularly shop at the country’s biggest drugstore chains and big-box retailers. In addition to selling widely purchased goods, these retailers have the most locations in the country. Walgreens, 7-Eleven and CVS Caremark all had more than 7,000 U.S. locations in 2012, among the most stores nationwide. Food chains were even more numerous. Subway, McDonald’s and Starbucks were all among the top five companies by store count, each with well over 14,000 U.S. locations in 2012. Many of the most popular stores with consumers tended to have large advertising budgets. According to Shim, \"From our perspective, [advertising] dollars do matter in terms of driving traffic in the store.\" In fact, seven of the 10 most popular stores were among the top-spenders on advertising nationwide in 2011 and 2012, according to Advertising Age, a magazine providing market and industry data. Placed found that consumers’ habits differed considerably by gender and income level. \"Fast food typically tends to skew more men than women,\" Shim said. In contrast, retail shoppers skew female. While men and women were equally likely to go to Starbucks, shoppers at Target were 16% more likely to be women, and Taco Bell diners were 13% more likely to be men. Americans making more than $100,000 per year were on the whole were more likely to shop at big-box retailers and drugstores than those making between $25,000 and $100,000. On the other hand, consumers making less than $25,000, were more likely to eat at three of the most popular fast food restaurants — Burger King, McDonald’s and Taco Bell — than those making more than $100,000. To determine the nation’s most popular stores, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from location analytics company Placed. Placed calculated the percentage of Americans who visited various stores in March 2014. The group also provided demographic and socioeconomic data on customers for various retailers and restaurants . These are indexed to a base of 100, representing the average American consumer. We also reviewed 2012 U.S. sales and store count data from the National Retail Federation’s Stores.org, as well as advertising expenditure figures from AdAge covering 2011 and 2012. These are America’s most popular stores: 1. Walmart > Index score, women: 106 > Index score, men: 93 > Store count: 4,570 > One-year stock-price change : -0.9% > Store category : Department store Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is far and away the nation’s largest retailer, with nearly $329 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2012. Unlike many other popular destinations, Americans earning more than $100,000 a year were far less likely to visit Walmart than the average American. Walmart continues to grow, having increased its U.S. store count 3.3% to 4,570 locations in 2012. Walmart spent $1.8 billion on advertising in 2012, effectively unchanged from the year before, but still more than all but a handful of companies. 2. McDonald’s > Index score, women : 97 > Index score, men : 103 > Store count: 14,146 > One-year stock-price change : -0.6% > Store category : Restaurant McDonald’s was by far the most visited fast- food restaurant in the nation in March. Although McDonald’s remains hugely popular, its U.S. same-store sales declined by 1.7% this quarter from the same quarter the year before, with reports citing slowing service times and heightened competition. Among the company’s plans to draw diners back to its stores is the recent unveiling of the newly redesigned Ronald McDonald, which attempts to make the icon more contemporary and less clown-like. Like several other popular stores, McDonald’s Corp. has among the nation’s largest advertising budgets, spending $1.4 billion on ads in 2012, up 4.2% from a year before. 3. Subway > Index score, women: 95 > Index score, men : 105 > Store count: 25,900 > One-year stock-price chang e: N/A > Store category: Restaurant Among restaurants, Subway trails only McDonald’s in popularity. While more Americans visit the Golden Arches, by the end of 2010 Subway actually passed McDonald’s in the number of stores globally, at 33,749. Subway’s expansion continued in 2012, with the number of stores growing 3.5% that year, among the biggest increases nationwide among major chains. Subway spent nearly $545 million on advertising in 2012, up 6.1% from the year before, and more than most other U.S. companies. 4. Starbucks > Index score, women: 100 > Index score, men : 100 > Store count: 11,128 > One-year stock-price change : +18.2% > Store category : Restaurant Starbucks Corp. has dominated U.S. coffee sales for years. Its sales have generally continued to grow since its initial public offering in the early 1990s. The coffee chain has changed its product lineup in recent years, introducing a range of foods, including a larger breakfast and lunch menu. The stores also continue to attract coffee drinkers with its free Wi-Fi. Unlike many other popular stores, Starbucks is less segmented by gender or age. As David Shim explains, \"Everyone wants coffee.\" However, unlike others in the food sector, shoppers making more than $100,000 were far more likely — 58% — to buy cup of coffee at Starbucks than those making less than $25,000. 5. Walgreens > Index score, women: 105 > Index score, men : 94 > Store count: 7,821 > One-year stock-price change : +35.9% > Store category : Department store As with many retailers, Walgreens was more popular among women than men. Women were 11% more likely to visit Walgreens than men. The company expanded faster than many others recently, with the number of Walgreens locations growing by 2.2% between 2011 and 2012. Walgreen Co. — the largest pharmacy operator in the nation — was fined $80 million by the Food and Drug Administration last year for failing to properly control distribution of dangerous drugs. According to The New York Times, this was the largest fine ever paid by a pharmacy chain at the time.\n",

            "Paragraph: You've seen them on TV, the big screen and maybe even center stage at a sold-out arena, but there may also be someone you've overlooked this whole time — their twin. Some of their twins have followed in their famous brother or sister's footsteps, while others went a completely different route. Take a look at some of our favorite, yet lesser known, celebrity twins. Gisele and Patrícia Bündchen After 20 years in the business, Gisele Bündchen, 36, remains one of the world's most famous supermodels. Since 2002, Bündchen has been the highest-paid model in the world. But her career is just one part of her life, and the other part, perhaps the most important, is family. That includes her fraternal twin sister, Patrícia. \"Thank you for being always there for me, since the very beginning. I love you so much. #birthday #twinsister #bestfriendintheworld #love,\" she wrote on Facebook for their 35th birthday last year. Ashton and Michael Kutcher Before Ashton Kutcher, 39, made it big with his acting and modeling career, he was just another boy from Iowa, where he grew up with his fraternal twin brother, Michael. Michael faced some serious health problems as a child. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and got a heart transplant at the age of 13 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Scarlett and Hunter Johansson Scarlett Johansson, 32, may steal the spotlight with her movies, but her twin brother, Hunter, steals the attention with his height. Hunter is nearly a foot taller than his \"older\" sis. But the pair are close. ScarJo has brought Hunter as a date to many red carpet events, including the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2010. Jon and Dan Heder No, you're not seeing double — you're just seeing identical twins, Jon and Dan Heder, 39. You may remember Jon from his breakout role in \"Napoleon Dynamite.\" Dan is also active in show business. He has been credited with several producer gigs and has acted in various short films over the years. Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Bush Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Bush were 18 when their father was elected president, and the transition forced them into the spotlight. Now 35, Hager is a correspondent for the \"Today\" show and Bush is the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps. Aaron and Angel Carter Aaron Carter, 29, and his twin sister, Angel (left) are extremely close. In fact, Aaron walked his sister down the aisle in her 2014 wedding. Vin and Paul Diesel You may remember Vin Diesel's heartfelt Facebook tribute  a year after his good friend and actor Paul Walker died in Nov. 2013. In the post, titled \"The Two Pauls,\" Diesel joked that his twin brother, Paul, looked more like Walker than he did and said he considered Walker a brother. \"Pablo and my mother would have deep conversations... she claimed, that it was no accident that this on-screen duo has come to define brotherhood in Our millennium,\" Diesel wrote. Tasha and Sidra Smith Actress Tasha Smith, 45, who plays Cookie's (Tajari P. Henson's) sister Carol on FOX's hit series \"Empire,\" has an identical twin sister, Sidra. Like Tasha, Sidra has also acted, but mostly she works full time as a director and producer.\n",

Nightwing a.k.a. Batman's estranged sidekick in Zack Snyder's \"Man of Steel\" sequel, \"Batman Vs. Superman.\" The trade publication was not privy to the other two names. That Grayson will be part of Snyder's 2015 film was first reported by Latino Review on Wednesday. The site noted that \"Batman Vs. Superman\" producers were looking for \"a young John Hawkes-type\" to play the role, which will find Grayson and Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) at odds as the film starts. (Grayson, of course, was first known as Robin in the Batman comics.) Whether Driver, who plays Adam on the HBO series \"Girls\" and was a recent Emmy nominee, snags the role is unclear, but his career is definitely on the upswing. \"I'm definitely trying to figure this all out as I go along, how to craft a career,\" Driver told The New York Times in a recent interview. \"As things get bigger, I have days of depression, sitting in the house and wondering 'What are you doing?

Manuel made history Thursday by becoming the first African-American woman to win a medal in an individual swimming event. She tied Canadian swimmer Penny Oleksiak in the 100-meter freestyle, giving both of them the gold medal. According to According to The Gospel Herald , within moments of leaving the pool, Manuel was clear as to who deserved all of the credit for the victory. \"All I can say is all glory to God,\" an emotional Manuel said. \"This medal is not just for me, it’s for a whole bunch of people who have came before me, and been an inspiration to me and it’s for all the people after me who believe they can’t do it,\" she added. \"I want to be an inspiration to them that they can do it.\" \"It’s definitely been a long journey for the past four years.

            "Paragraph: Azaleas bloom in front of CF Taylor Alternative School, site of Tim Cook's old high school in Robertsdale, Alabama. (Photo by Jeff Haller for The Washington Post) For years, every student at Robertsdale High in tiny Robertsdale, Ala., was given their own Apple MacBook to use at school and at home. It seemed like a fitting nod to Robertsdale High's most famous graduate, Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Class of '78. His journey from small-town Alabama to the helm of the world's most-valuable company was chronicled in a story in today's Post. [The roots of Tim Cook’s activism lie in rural Alabama] In fact, Apple MacBooks were given to every student from third through 12th grade in Robertsdale and surrounding Baldwin County. Teachers, too. Younger students used Apple iPads. That added up to more than 20,000 Apple devices. It was part of a three-year, $24 million plan that school officials called the \"Digital Renaissance.\" But school officials decided to stop using Apple devices last month. Instead, students will be given Lenovo Chromebooks. The reason was simple: Cost. Each Chromebooks costs about $200, 75 percent less than a MacBook, according to school board documents. The school system plans to spend $6.6 million to buy 23,500 N21 Chromebooks to give to students before the start of classes this fall. That will be paid for by selling the used MacBooks. In arguing for moving away from Apple products, Homer Coffman, chief technology officer for Baldwin County schools, told the school board that not only are Chromebooks cheaper, but that they are \"simpler to maintain and simpler to use.\" And they're more secure than MacBooks. And teachers and students already use Google education applications, which are compatible with the Google-run Chromebooks. Coffman also -- perhaps somewhat harshly -- wrote that by moving away from Apple products \"Baldwin County will not be using bleeding edge technology with this implementation. It will be using proven technologies.\" Apple and Cook had nothing to do with Baldwin County's decision to start or end using Apple products. In recent years, Google has seized a dominant slice of the educational technology market with cheaper prices.\n",

            "Paragraph: Pokémon GO is one of the biggest game crazes to come along in history. Go to your local downtown area and tell me you don’t see groups of people on their smartphones trying to find a rare. You can still come across a good amount of uncommons, rares and epics, but legendaries are a whole other story. This game contains all of the original 151 Pokémon, meaning that the legendaries are represented by Mew, Mewtwo, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. Read on for info on how to get the Legendary Pokémon in Pokémon GO! First, let’s run through all of the rumors that have been flying around the internet. Many people have reported seeing Moltres, especially. One person has reported seeing Articuno’s silhouette with three footsteps next to it so far. Nobody that I know of has reported seeing Zapdos or the Mew twins in the wild. The biggest Mew twins rumor out there centers around the idea that Mewtwo can be found in Times Square. This stems from an old trailer for Pokémon GO that was released which involved players gathering in Times Square, with Mewtwo spawning across all of their phones. They teamed up to face Mewtwo and then they all caught him. That was just for the trailer, though. Mewtwo has not been spawned in the wild yet and according to the developer Niantic, none of them have. That is because Niantic has to manually spawn the legendaries. The legendaries, unlike the common and even rare Pokémon that permeate the rest of the game, do not show up unless they are manually made to show up. So the way to get the legendaries is to wait for a special event to happen, and if Niantic’s prior game Ingress is any indication, there will be loads of special events, probably held monthly or whenever there is a new console Pokémon game released or to celebrate an anniversary of some kind. Bring along plenty of Great Balls, Ultra Balls and Master Balls with you when these special events. Niantic has previously, in the game Ingress, organized events where players fight to take control of a city, and a citywide event could certainly lead to earning the legendaries. In addition, players are organized into three teams with Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres as mascots, so a worldwide top-team competition or an intra-team competition to be the top trainer could be organized with those three birds as the rewards. Having extremely high combat power or CP will help. As for Ditto, it, like the legendaries, is in the source code of the game; however, Ditto has not been added to the game yet and is so far the only non-legendary Pokémon that not one single person has caught. Expect Ditto to be added to Pokémon GO with a future update to the game. When it is, we will be there with some tips and tricks on how to find Ditto.\n",

            "Paragraph: The Pokémon Go craze is sweeping across America. See how the game works, why everyone's so crazy about it, and all the stories that have come from it, from the game's positive impact on depression victims to armed robberies. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) This is part of an occasional series in which we explain Internet things. We like to call it memesplaining; you might call it meme-ruining. Regardless, if you just chanced upon an image macro, hashtag or GIF you don’t understand, we have the answers — insofar as answers can be had. The meme: Pokémon Go What it is Pokémon Go is a (possibly overrated?) augmented-reality game that launched in the United States late last week. In a nutshell, the game lays a sort of semi-transparent Poké-world over your actual, geographical location, which you can explore by physically walking around while staring zombie-like at your screen. [The first Pokemon game for smartphones is not what I expected] Pokémon Go has some things in common with the Pokémon franchise that captivated kids in the late 1990s: As in those games, the objective is to find and capture mythical creatures called Pokémon, which can be upgraded and squared off against each other. Pokémon Go differs in a few key respects, though. For starters, as of this writing, there’s no actual mission to work on or some big boss to beat — the point of the game is to amble around more or less aimlessly. You can’t trade Pokémon yet, although that’s allegedly coming, and features such as battling and training have been deliberately watered down. Go also has a wildly popular feature that allows you to take screenshots of Pokémon in the \"wild\" — i.e., on your desk, on a child’s head or on your wife’s hospital bed immediately before she gives birth. Those screenshots, which have blown up on Twitter and Reddit at a truly alarming rate, are critical to the appeal of the game. [The non-gamer’s guide to playing Pokemon Go] Pokémon Go has already been downloaded more times than the dating app Tinder, and it is rapidly encroaching on Twitter, which has been around for a full 10 years. Nintendo’s stock soared nearly 25 percent Monday because of the game — its biggest gain in more than 30 years. Where it started The game was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 6 and was rolled out in the United States the day after. It was supposed to become available in more countries from there, but so many people are already playing the game — overloading its servers — that international rollout has been paused indefinitely. Naturally, that is not stopping some determined players in Europe and elsewhere: It is possible to download Pokémon Go, no matter where you are, by changing your phone’s region settings. [Pokémon Go craze sweeps nation: Players find monsters — and worse] Who started it Go was developed by Niantic, a company spun out from Google and known to many as the studio that previously brought you \"Ingress.\" That game is conceptually similar to Pokémon Go, in that you have to get out and explore the \"real world\" to play it. Niantic chief executive John Hanke explained his motivation this way in an interview with the New York Times last month: \"Everyone is spending all this time inside, by their computers. No one goes to the local parks. We wanted to do something that was aspirational: Let’s get people outside. ... Part of the joy of the game is going off the beaten path. We’re not about being strapped in a couch in ‘The Matrix.’\" How to play it as if you know what you’re doing There are already a million guides to playing Pokémon Go out there, from Polygon’s tips for the \"ultimate beginner\" to Game Revolution’s \"advanced\" strategies. Regardless of where you fall on that spectrum, though, the best way to not look like an idiot while playing is to ... not look like you’re playing. Seriously. (Others may think differently about this, but I was sort of embarrassed when a smug stranger in the park across from The Washington Post office sidled up to me and said: \"You’re playing Pokémon, aren’t you? EVERYBODY IS.\") To avoid such encounters, I suggest a dual strategy: One, find a viable cover for your phone-distracted wandering. (A dog is helpful here, as is any car ride in city traffic when you’re sitting in the passenger seat.) Two, limit yourself to casual, incidental checks in public — of the kind you might usually deploy for your email or Facebook notifications. Added bonus: This will also help you avoid walking into people or suffering other accidents. A smart observation to make at your next nerdy dinner party More than a mobile game, Pokémon Go is sort of a massive-scale trial run for augmented-reality technology: a chance to get consumers used to the idea of interacting in mixed virtual and physical environments. The more people adopt it, the more situations like the one I described above — where it felt awkward to be called out for playing in public — will actually seem normal, even expected. As the co-founder of one augmented-reality company told NPR, \"I think this could be a real driver of early adoption and bringing people into the fold.\" And last but not least, further reading:\n",

            "Paragraph: Plenty of people are complaining about the new Instagram logo and want it changed back to the \"original.\" But wrap your mind around this little-known fact: The old Instagram logo — the square instant camera with the tiny rainbow — was actually not the original. Before Instagram had the iconic logo we're all familiar with (and are now wistfully remembering), the app actually brandished a design that looked a lot more like a real camera, designed by CEO Kevin Systrom himself. Systrom said in 2011 that he changed the logo because it \"had nothing to do with Instagram,\" and enlisted the help of one of the app's users, designer and photographer Cole Rise, to design a new one back in the fall of 2010. The original Instagram icon Image: Instagram But that's not the whole story. Mashable caught up with Rise in the wake of Instagram's big change. Far from being bitter over seeing his work cast aside, Rise thinks the new icon is great, which probably isn't surprising since he's a friend and former colleague of both of Instagram's founders. SEE ALSO: Instagram just changed its logo in a big way \"I'm super psyched on the new one,\" Rise says. \"I love the minimalism. Regardless of the colors behind it, the white shape — the actual bones of the new symbol itself — is beautiful, and I think that can persist over time.\" Rise says he's also a friend of Robert Padbury, one of the architects of the new icon and one of the designers behind other big tech design changes, including Uber's revamp from earlier this year and Apple's huge shift to flat design in iOS 7. \"If anyone is going to update it, I trust that guy,\" Rise says. \"He's done so many great icons. I'm glad to see him riff on it.\" Genesis of an icon Rise's old design came about when the app was virtually brand-new. Systrom and his co-founder, Mike Krieger, had just formally launched Instagram in the App Store after a months-long beta. Rise was an active beta user (in fact, the app's Rise filter is named after him) and had become friends the the pair. Instagram's old app icons (above) vs. the new ones. Image: Instagram \"I was just helping out a couple of buddies of mine who were launching a new photo app,\" recounts Rise. \"I think they're the smartest people in the world. I was really excited about [Instagram] as a photographer.\" When the app was about to launch in October 2010, Apple wanted to put Instagram in the store's \"featured\" section. But there was a problem: The original logo — which Systrom designed himself and was basically a stylized rendering of a real Polaroid OneStep instant camera — was using a trademarked design, and it had to go. So Systrom called Rise since he had recently created a camera-like app icon he liked. \"He said, 'We can't use our current icon because of trademark stuff, so I was wondering if we could buy an old icon you had done.' He was referring to an icon I had designed that was inspired by a Bell & Howell camera, an 8mm camera from the '50s.\" Rise's \"Uooo\" icon that served as inspiration for the Instagram icon. Image: Cole Rise Rise went to work, and in about 45 minutes, the Instagram logo was born. That icon was spoken for, however. Rise, who has created his own apps over the years, had designed the icon for his startup, but he told Systrom he might be able to rework the design into something for Instagram. Systrom gave him an hour. Rise went to work, and in about 45 minutes, the Instagram logo was born. \"I made this brand-new imaginary camera that was Bell & Howell-inspired, with elements of the old icon so it was an easier transition,\" he says. The logo Rise submitted that day was a less-polished version of the logo we've been tapping on for years. He continued to iterate with Systrom's guidance, adding details like adding an overhead lighting effect, and detailing the room reflected in the camera lens (you can see a window if you look closely). The final version of Rise's icon shipped with Instagram 2.0 in 2011. Instagram 1.0 vs. 2.0 Image: Instagram \"We got really nerdy on it,\" Rise says. \"As a joke, we designed the back of the icon. We shipped it off to Facebook when they got acquired, it was a nice handoff.\" The \"back\" of the Instagram icon. Image: Cole Rise Although Rise likes the new logo, there's been plenty of panic on Twitter about the change, particularly with the choice of colors and the gradient. He chalks the reaction up to the standard hand-wringing whenever a major product or service changes. \"It's kind of like the Uber redesign — people freaked out, and now it's totally fine. Change can be hard, and people will have to adjust to it, but I think people will love the new stuff once they get used to it on their home screens.\" BONUS: Why Instagram is the No. 1 iPhone app of all time Have something to add to this story?

            "Paragraph: (CNN) Are you having enough sex? You might have wondered if you should up your bedroom activity after reading about other couples' resolutions to have sex every day or about all the health benefits of getting horizontal . In what might be welcome news for everyone exhausted from work and frazzled from kids, research suggests you don't have to get down every day to reap the rewards of sex, at least in terms of happiness and relationship closeness. \"I do think couples can end up feeling pressure to try to engage in sex as frequently as possible,\" said Amy Muise , a postdoctoral researcher studying sexual relationships at Dalhousie University in Canada. Once a week \"is maybe a more realistic goal to set than thinking you have to have sex everyday and that feels overwhelming and you avoid it,\" said Muise, who is lead author of the study, which was published in November in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. The study found that sex could boost happiness because it makes people feel more satisfied in their relationship, based on survey data from two separate cohorts, including 2,400 married couples in the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households. \"For people in relationships, their romantic relationship quality is one of the biggest predictors of their overall happiness,\" Muise said. \"Having sex more than once a week might not be enhancing that (relationship connection), although it is not bad.\" However, there are a couple of rubs with this research, Muise said. One is that it is not clear which came first, sex or happiness. It may be that people who have sex once a week or more were happier in their relationship and life to begin with, and not that the sex helped make them happy. Or both may be true: Sex enhances happiness and happiness enhances sex. The other catch is that, although a weekly romp might be just what some people need, it might be too much or too little for others. \"Certainly there are couples for whom having sex less frequently will be fine for their happiness, and there are couples who will get increases in happiness if they have sex more than once a week,\" Muise said. What's the right number for you? \"One of the best effects of an article like this (by Muise and her colleagues) is that it opens up conversations with couples\" about their sex life, said Vanessa Marin, a sex therapist based in Berlin. For some couples, the question of how often they should have sex might not have come up, which could be a sign they feel sufficiently close and satisfied -- or that they are just too busy or disconnected to think about it. \"Most couples want to be having more sex and I think this is really a result of how busy and full most of our lives are,\" Marin said. Marin avoids prescribing an amount of sex that couples should have, because every couple is different, and instead recommends couples test it out for themselves. \"I'm a big fan of having clients experiment, like, one month try to have sex twice a week and see how that goes, or once a week, try to play around with it,\" Marin said. As for those lucky couples that are content with how often they get busy under the sheets, one study suggests they may not want to change a thing. Researchers asked couples that were having sex about six times a month to double down on getting down. Couples that doubled their sexual frequency were in worse moods and enjoyed sex less at the end of three months than couples who had stuck to their usual level of bedroom activity. \"Being told you should do something always makes it less fun,\" said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the study. That is another reason Marin does not make recommendations to couples about sexual frequency -- for fear they could worry they are not living up to expectations and lose their mojo. However, there's a far bigger relationship problem than couples worrying they aren't having quite enough sex -- \"couples that have pretty much stopped having sex,\" Loewenstein said. For these couples, \"I think once a week is a good final goal. ... It is almost like a natural constant to do it once a week,\" he said. Even if these abstinent couples want to be having more sex, they may lack the desire for their partner. These couples can try conventional strategies, such as scheduling more quality time together or trying a change in scenery. \"What couple has not had the experience that you go to a hotel in a new location in a new environment and the person you're with seems different, and different is good when it comes to sex,\" Loewenstein said. But if these tricks aren't enough, couples may have to appeal to their rational rather than lustful side and tell themselves to just do it. \"These couples might be surprised how enjoyable it would be if they restarted,\" Loewenstein said. Should you schedule your sex? It might sound like the least romantic thing in the world to pencil in sexy time with your partner. But if you and your partner are game to try, there is no reason not to make a sex schedule. \"For some couples, scheduling sex works really well, it gives them something to look forward to, they like the anticipation, they like feeling prioritized,\" Marin said. \"Then other couples (say) scheduling sex feels horrible to them, like sex is transactional and just another item on their to-do list.\" Again, Marin recommends couples experiment with scheduling sex to see if it helps them, as long as neither is opposed to it. A good idea for all couples, whether they like the idea of scheduling sex, is to plan for quality time together -- just the two of them. Ideally, this would be about 20 minutes a day with the TV off and cell phones away, but for extra busy couples, it can help to reserve just five minutes a day for a tete-a-tete, Marin said. This time is also the \"container for sex,\" the time and privacy when sex can be initiated, but you don't have to feel pressure about it, she added. Although scheduling sex can help couples that want to be having sex but just can't find the time, it can make things worse for some. \"If there are relationship issues or psychological issues such as stress or anxiety, then scheduling sex might just add to the pressure,\" said Acacia Parks, associate professor of psychology at Hiram College. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. As for when to schedule the sex, the best time is probably the time when you are least likely to be pulled away by life's obligations. One of the perks of rise-and-shine sex is that testosterone levels are highest in the morning, and this hormone drives sexual desire. On the other hand, tuck-you-in sex could help lull you to sleep, as hormones released during orgasm could help you relax and feel tired. According to Muise, the participants in her research typically reported having sex at night before going to sleep, which is not that surprising. But it has to work for both parties. \"This is another point of negotiation between partners,\" Muise said. \"One of them is just too exhausted. That might be something to play around with, is there a time on the weekend that we could try instead.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Veteran Republican consultant Rick Wilson has been at the vanguard of the #NeverTrump movement. As other anti-Trump Republicans have fallen in line for the sake of party unity, Wilson has continued to launch fiery (and profanity-laced) tirades against the presumptive GOP nominee and the party poobahs backing him. On Wednesday night, he unleashed an epic tweetstorm, denouncing Republican National Committee staffers for working to get Trump elected. \"You own this,\" he warned. \"You're covered in his stench.\" In the course of his Twitter rant, Wilson coined a new nickname for Trump, \"Cheeto Jesus,\" which fast became a meme.

It seems as if the pop music world has spent the past 10 months getting in \"Formation,\" but Sunday night made one thing clear: Grammy voters prefer Adele to Beyoncé. The New York Times pop music team had discussed the possibility of Adele sweeping the major categories at the 59th annual Grammy Awards in a Popcast previewing the ceremony. It was a scenario that left the Recording Academy open to criticism that voters had been slow to acknowledge the contributions of younger black artists, preferring more classic songwriting and production. And then it came true. For a debriefing on a Grammy night that also featured a political statement by A Tribe Called Quest, two big podium moments for Chance the Rapper, a pantsless acceptance speech by Twenty One Pilots, a dramatic performance by Beyoncé and a Prince tribute from Bruno Mars, Mr. Caramanica was joined by the chief pop music critic, Jon Pareles; the pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli; and the pop music editor, Caryn Ganz.

            "Paragraph: You can buy anything online these days, right? It seems that way, but when Aaron Krane tried to purchase his last car via a dealership's website, he quickly learned that although he knew exactly what he wanted to buy, he still needed to physically go into the store to complete the purchase.  Krane couldn't find a way to buy a car online anywhere, as such functionality was yet to exist in the automotive industry. As a serial entrepreneur who was part of the core team at Slide (which was acquired by Google), the founder of Hitpost (acquired by Yahoo!), and EIR at Khosla Ventures, Mr. Krane knew a disruptable industry when he saw one. Aaron Krane, pic via Drive Motors It was with this in mind that he created Drive Motors, the Silicon Valley startup which builds e-commerce solutions for auto dealerships.  Drive Motors powers dealerships to sell directly through their websites, providing them with a buy online button. The company is backed by Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, and Propel Venture Partners. All the trials and triumphs of building a business  delivered to your inbox. By offering a solution which modernizes the 100 year old automotive industry, you would think it would seem easy to build momentum. However, in order to gain traction, Drive Motors first needed to educate the dealership community on why now is the time to embrace e-commerce, and how it would help-- not replace-- the current dealership model. This is a challenge many startups face when they are seeking to introduce new technology solutions to an industry with a strong legacy processes.  It requires a company to uniquely become the expert voice of the very industry they are trying to change. Over 150 stores currently use Drive Motors' online checkout, and dealership volume has doubled nearly every month for the last three.   So what are some of the lessons learned about how to market innovation to an industry that may or may not be ready to embrace it? Know Your Audience:  According to Krane, developing a true connection and empathy for your target customer is critical, even if the temptation might be to rush to market with what you perceive as the 'right' solution. If you want to solve a problem, spend ninety-five percent of your time researching the problem, and five percent of your time designing the solution.  Krane and his team spent approximately nine months researching and observing the inner-workings of dealerships, which allowed them to be laser-focused on the exact needs and attributes of his customers.  tRelationships Matter:  In the world of digital marketing, it may seem that online connection is the only tactic needed to engage customers. Not true, according to Krane. Our head of dealership success and I flew from San Francisco to Atlanta for a single day, just to say hello and check-in with a large customer with whom we were piloting. We returned from that trip with an expanded pilot program, and two months later, we onboarded the entire group.  Why? It's important to interact directly with your customers on a frequent basis, and invest resources in keeping them happy. tBecome An Insider:  Once you know your audience, and you've developed relationships with them, leverage key introductions and customer references to become a trusted player in the space, said Krane. That concept of becoming a trusted brand holds true not just in business development efforts, but also in media relations, as Krane experienced.  For example,  some of his most successful media efforts have been around showcasing how he was driving value for dealerships, instead of just promoting his own product.  The result? Other inbound inquiries around how Drive Motors could help other dealerships too. Becoming a trusted brand is an ongoing effort, and sometimes requires overcoming an initial industry skepticism.  However,  as Drive Motors has found, with the three tactics above, the road becomes easier and easier. \n",

            "Paragraph: Celebrity is fleeting, and to some it can come at too high a price. There were many times when our favorite actors, musicians, and other shining stars were extinguished too soon, at the height of their careers. Some stars who died too young passed away from natural causes. Some succumbed to the pressures of fame, dying from drug overdoses or suicide. Others were tragically killed, losing their lives long before the world was ready to lose them. Despite their passing, these figures live on in the TV, films, and music they have created. Here are some of the famous stars who died too young. Which of these tragic figures do you miss the most? SHARE your memories on Facebook, and make sure to pass this along so we never forget these legendary talents. 1. Paul Walker The sudden death of this charismatic Fast & Furious actor shocked the world. After leaving a charity event in California, Walker got a lift from race car driver Roger Rodas. Both were killed in the fiery crash. At 40 years old, Walker was coming into his own as a bona fide star. 2. Cory Monteith This star, known for playing Finn Hudson on the FOX TV show Glee, often battled addiction and depression. An abrupt end to his life came at the age of 31, due to a drug overdose. 3. Heath Ledger It is often said that only the good die young. This rising star passed away at age 28 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Ledger died just before the hugely successful movie The Dark Knight was released in theaters. For his role as the Joker, he won a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. 4.

When he suddenly died at age 32 from a brain swelling, the entire world mourned his death. 10. Brandon Lee He followed in his father’s footsteps in too many ways. Like his dad, Bruce Lee, Brandon was a rising film star and martial artist. A freak accident involving a prop gun while filming The Crow took his life at age 28. 11.

She was 36. Her sons are Prince William and Prince Harry. 20. Marvin Gaye This world-famous Motown singer was fatally shot by his father on April 1, 1984. While his parents were in a heated argument, Marvin tried to intervene on his mother’s behalf. Ironically, the gun that killed him was the same gun Marvin had given his father to protect their home from intruders. He died at age 44. 21. Amy Winehouse This amazing singer was truly destined for superstardom until she tragically died of alcohol poisoning at the young age of 27. Winehouse had battled addiction for years. The world of music lost a great talent. 22. Selena Quintanilla Perez She was one of the hottest and most talented Mexican-American music stars, with millions of fans around the world.

Jonathan Brandis This talented young actor seemed destined for Hollywood stardom, yet fate threw him a curve and his career didn’t take off as many had expected. This may have led to his depression and eventual suicide at age 27.\n",

            "Paragraph: A WHOPPING 23 medical experts and other staff were on hand to help deliver Prince George and Princess Charlotte, a senior member of the team has revealed. The exact facts surrounding the births of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s children were shrouded in secrecy for security reasons – until now. To help her through the labour, Kate had at her disposal: two obstetricians, three midwives, three anaesthetists, four theatre staff, two special care baby unit staff, four paediatricians, one laboratory technician to check blood samples and four senior managers. The Duchess, 34, gave birth to both children at the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London. \"We had a huge team,\" Professor Tiong Ghee Teoh, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital told The Daily Telegraph. \"I was back-up to Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who led the team, but for anything that could possibly go wrong we had a team of people behind each specialty. \"Everyone was sworn to secrecy about who it was.\" Professor Teoh said the team met monthly to discuss Kate’s birth plan and then weekly as the due date got closer. Describing her as a \"fit young lady\", he added: \"They are the best patients. \"At the end of the day you want to deliver a healthy, happy baby to a healthy, happy mother – and that’s what happened.\" But it seems Kate didn’t really get any special royal treatment – according to Professor Teoh most mums-to-be have this amount of people involved in our births. The difference is, they don’t have named doctors – it’s whoever is on call that day. Kate’s luxurious private delivery suite cost an average of £4,965 a night and featured an en suite, wireless internet, satellite TV and champagne on request. There was also a chair for William to recline in while he waiting to meet his new arrival.\n",

            "Paragraph: Willem Dafoe is not a fan of Sony's \"Spider-Man\" reboot, \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" Dafoe, who starred as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. Green Goblin) in Sam Raimi's 2002 film about the young webslinger, told Total Film that he was disappointed to see the studio take another crack at the character. \"I saw a trailer for the first Spider-Man reboot and I thought, 'This is crazy! It's not shot for shot, but it's the same story,'\" Dafoe said. \"I thought, 'This is sort of a cynical approach to making money!'\" Indeed, while there were some major differences between 2002's \"Spider-Man\" and 2012's \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" -- notably, that Spider-Man fights The Lizard instead of Green Goblin, and that Mary Jane doesn't appear -- the film's were largely structured the same, owing to the fact that \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was yet another origin story for the character. Dafoe isn't the first \"Spider-Man\" actor to question the existence of \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" James Franco, who played Dafoe's onscreen son, Harry, in the film and its sequels, has gone on record twice before about his issues with director Marc Webb's reboot. \"I mean, they could have strayed a little bit more from the original,\" Franco said to MTV in January of this year. \"It's like, 'Why?' Well, I guess they made a lot of money. Congrats. Good for them. Sam and I moved on, we made 'Oz The Great And Powerful.'\" In a piece published by Vice in June, Franco wrote that the 2012 Spider-Man reboot was made \"before there was time to bury the corpse of the old one and enshroud it in the haze of nostalgia.\" In fact, of the original \"Spider-Man\" participants, only Raimi himself has come out in favor of \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" \"I loved it,\" Raimi told the website Hey U Guys back in March of this year. \"Of course the next Spider-Man story should be told, and [Marc Webb] did a wonderful job telling that. I loved the movie, and I'm looking forward like a fan to the next installment. I love the comic book, and now I don't feel bound, and I'm really glad somebody's remaking it again.\" For more from Dafoe, head to Total Film.

            "Paragraph: My parents are My parents are divorced . They actually had a good divorce. It doesn’t make me sad to think or talk about it. I have no memories of terrible fights or custody battles. No, they decided their marriage wasn’t working out and just decided to go forward as friends instead. They’re still best friends to this day. So, I guess as far as children of divorce go, I’m the best-case scenario. That being said, I don’t want to get divorced. I want to get married and live happily ever after. I mean, don’t we all? Maybe not the marriage thing but the happily ever after. Nobody wants to fall in love with THE ONE, only to have it all fall apart years down the line. Whether we admit it or not, I think we’re all terrified of getting divorced. That being said, a , finds what increases the probability of divorce for some couples. Whether we admit it or not, I think we’re all terrified of getting divorced. That being said, a new study shows some of us should be a little more terrified than others. Harvard sociologist, Alexandra Achen Killewald’s study, published in the American Sociological Reviewfinds what increases the probability of divorce for some couples. This study was no joke. She tracked 6,309 (yes, 6,309) married couples between 1968 and 2013. In that time, 1,684 of these couples either divorced or permanently separated. What she found in her study was interesting. While a wife’s paid or unpaid labor has little to do with her chance at a divorce, whether or not the husband is working full-time is the biggest determinant in their likelihood of getting divorced. Turns out that, despite the many strides we’ve made in feminism since 1968, we still like our men to be breadwinners. A man with full-time employment has a 2.5 percent of his marriage splitting up within the next year, while a man without a full-time job endured a 3.3 percent chance of the same. Killewald explains the significance of these findings to Killewald explains the significance of these findings to New York Magazine’s Science of Us This shows that, for contemporary couples, wives can combine paid and unpaid labor in various ways without threatening the stability of their marriages. Meanwhile, men have to be a little more concerned, But, for those same marriage cohorts, the risk of divorce increases substantially when the husband isn’t employed full-time. If you’re a man afraid of divorce, I’d suggest a full-time job.\n",

The idea was to challenge friends to either dump a bucket of ice water over their heads or donate to the ALS Association. A lot of people—over 17 million—got doused in icy water. You remember, you were there. Everyone was there. 50 Cent was there. Most Popular A lot of people also donated, giving those who denounced the challenge as a viral blip with no real power something to think about. With the reported $115 million raised from the Ice Bucket Challenge, the ALS Association funded six research projects, one of which recently published its findings: identification of a new gene that contributes to the disease. According to the BBC, finding the gene can lead to gene therapy treatment for about 10 percent of those with ALS and allow scientists to better understand the neurodegenerative disease, which affects around 20,000 Americans. So, thank you, eager teens and invested celebrities and 50 Cent. There's power in virality after all.\n",

            "Paragraph: A new study finds that the wealthiest Americans are less mobile than lower income workers, but those who do relocate are looking for a tax cut. Like its economy, America’s tax system is heavy up top—especially at the state level, where payments from the super-rich form a substantial share of revenue. When hedge-fund magnate David Tepper announced he was moving from New Jersey to Florida, the state estimated that it could face millions of dollars in lost taxes, putting New Jersey’s revenue base and budget at risk. Indeed, income tax rates vary considerably across states, from zero in places like Florida to nearly nine percent or more in states like New York. With inequality rising and related political concerns rising faster still, a number of states have imposed millionaire taxes in an effort to close the growing wealth gap, redistribute income, and generate more revenue. But to what extent do the super-rich actually move away from a state to avoid taxes? That’s the key issue addressed in a new study published in the American Sociological Review by Cristobal Young and Charles Varner of Stanford and Ithai Z. Lurie and Richard Prisinzano from the U.S. Treasury Department. To get at this, the authors used detailed IRS data on the tax returns of all million-dollar income-earners in the U.S. between 1999 and 2011. Strikingly, they find that millionaires move at a lower rate (2.4 percent) than the population as a whole (2.9 percent). The chart below, which tracks migration rates from 1999 to 2011, shows how these rates fall as incomes rise. Those making $10,000 a year have the highest migration rates—about 4.5 percent per year. As incomes climb, the migration rate falls steadily, until it reaches its lowest point (2 percent) for those making $90,000 a year. Once incomes reach millionaire-level, the migration rate increases, but only slightly. As the study points out, \"higher-income earners show greater residential stability ... than do low-income earners.\" In other words, the well-off tend to be even more settled than other residents. (Young et al.) \"Persistent millionaires\"—those who earn $1 million or more year after year—have the lowest overall migration rates (1.9 percent); substantially less than one-time millionaires (3.2 percent), according to the study. Thus, residents with a consistent flow of wealth are less likely to migrate outside of their own state. \"These results help explain how elite income embeds people in their local regions,\" the authors write. \"People who can expect continuous flows of million-dollar income over time do not tend to move.\" In other words, the consistently rich are the most settled of all, mainly because they depend on the places they live for their wealth to begin with. As readers of this site know, the industries and businesses where Americans are likely to make the most money tend to be highly concentrated in high-cost, high-tax locations like New York, D.C., San Francisco, and L.A. That said, those millionaires who do move are more likely to move to a lower-tax state, the study finds. On average, a 10 percent increase in a state’s top tax rate leads to a one percent decline in its millionaires. Still, only around 2 percent of millionaires move due to income taxes, according to the study. To dig deeper into millionaire migration, the study examines the migration patterns for two states with high tax rates (New York and Illinois) and two with no personal income tax (Texas and Florida). In New York and Illinois, the study does find a net out-migration of millionaires, particularly to states with lower tax rates. And in Texas, the study finds a net in-migration of millionaires. Interestingly, all three states saw a large portion of their millionaires migrating to Florida. In fact, Florida has a net in-migration of millionaires from nearly every state in the U.S., especially from those with higher tax rates. The study dubs this influx of millionaires \"the Florida effect.\" After removing Florida from the equation, they find little evidence of millionaire migration—even to low- or no-tax states such as Texas, Tennessee, or New Hampshire. The authors also look at the flow of millionaires in counties that border states. The map below shows the tax differences for 1,134 counties adjacent to interstate borders, representing 35 percent of all millionaires and 32 percent of the U.S. population. On the map, high-tax sides of the border are shaded in blue, and low-tax sides are shaded in orange. Those states with the largest tax differences between their borders include Oregon and Washington (7.3 percentage points), Vermont and New Hampshire (6.7), and North Carolina and Tennessee (6.4). Between bordering counties within the same state, the study finds, the county with the higher taxes has a significantly smaller millionaire population. (Young et al.) That said, the study finds no difference in millionaire population between the low- and high-tax counties that straddle state borders. What’s more, millionaire migration does not seem to be affected by shifts in a state’s tax rates. Ultimately, the study finds that, while some millionaires do move to lower-tax destinations, the overall rate of millionaire migration is extremely low. When all is said and done, the super-rich tend to migrate less then the rest of us. The reason for this is simple—most people depend on the places they live for their incomes, since their businesses are based there. Indeed, this new study confirms an increasingly important fact of our economic geography: because some places generate a lot more wealth than others, the amount of money we make is largely tied to where we live.\n",

            "Topic: Here's what Apple's new iPhone is missing\n",
            "Paragraph: But it’s looking forward to next year’s phone release Time This file photo taken on June 13, 2016 shows the Apple logo displayed on a screen at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference presentation at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California. (Photo: GABRIELLE LURIE, AFP/Getty Images) Diehard Apple (AAPL) fans are fretting over what will go missing in the newest iPhone. But investors are more worried about something other than an absent headphone jack: The missing enthusiasm for Apple's stock. Shares of Apple are down 0.7% in the 30 days leading up to the 11th iPhone product launch expected Wednesday, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 index 0.1% increase during the same time. The lackluster stock reaction coming into the smartphone announcement is a departure from previous Apple smartphone launches going back to the original iPhone almost a decade ago. On average, Apple shares have gained 3.8% in the month prior to an announcement. The last iPhone, the shrunken-down and discounted SE, certainly sparked more interest, gaining 10.3% in the 30 days prior to the March 2016 announcement as the S&P 500 rose 6.9%. The lack of excitement is notable given the importance of the product to Apple; iPhone revenue accounted for two-thirds of Apple's revenue last year, according to market research firm Trefis. All this shows investors, despite media hoopla, aren't looking for much from the iPhone 7, says UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a note to clients. \"Investors already anticipate underwhelming iPhone 7 features,\" Milunovich says. Apple's shares are lagging the market ahead of the iPhone 7 launch. (Photo: S&P Global Market Intelligence, USA TODAY via Microsoft Excel) The lackluster run of the stock ahead of the new smartphone announcement is even more disappointing since the stock typically runs into pressure afterwards. Apple's stock has declined an average of 0.6% in the 30 days after the previous iPhone announcements going back to 2007. In the last four cycles, shares of Apple fell 4% in the two weeks after new phones were actually launched and made available, Milunovich says. The smartphone is a mature product and the company's other offerings ranging from watches to tablet computers as well as music and payment services have failed to pick up the slack. Apple's revenue is expected to fall 8% this fiscal year ended in September to $215.4 billion, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even with a new smartphone launch, next fiscal year, analysts see revenue inching up just 4%, a fraction of its 28% revenue growth in fiscal 2015 and 31% average revenue growth over the past five fiscal years. Samsung also continues to challenge Apple's cash cow. Apple claimed 75% of the premium-tier smartphone profits in the second quarter, says Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. But that's down from Apple's 90% share of profit in the first quarter due to Samsung capitalizing on better demand for its Galaxy S7 device, he says. Investors appear to be saying Apple's halcyon days may be over. Shares are down 4% over the past year to $107.70, as of Tuesday's close, while the S&P 500 is up nearly 11%. Investors are paying roughly 12 times for every dollar in earnings the company is expected to post this fiscal year, which is \"similar to other large computer vendors,\" says Milunovich, who is holding his price target on the stock at $115 a share. And that's the bright spot for investors at least hoping the stock will stop falling as expectations are brought down. Consumers waiting to upgrade their phones may finally pay up for the iPhone 7 or new phones launched in 2018, Walkley says. Apple still also has a large captive audience of users to pitch its services to, Walkley says. Analysts think Apple shares should be worth $123.25 each in 18 months. \"Barring any surprises, such as an iPhone price cut, we see limited downside risk,\" Milunovich says.\n",

            "Paragraph: Jon Heder shot to fame with the 2004 indie hit Napoleon Dynamite. Just a few years later, he'd pretty much disappeared from the spotlight, and these days, it seems like movie studios want nothing to do with him. Why isn't Jon Heder welcome in Tinseltown anymore? He's kind of a one-hit wonder This isn't to say that Jon Heder is a bad actor. He's made some enjoyable films. It's just that no matter what he does, he's never going to shake Napoleon Dynamite. In School for Scoundrels, he attempted to play a romantic lead. In Blades of Glory, he played an eccentric, disgraced figure skater. Yet whenever audiences hear or see his name, they expect to see the curly-haired, bespectacled nerd who danced his way into movie watchers' hearts. A string of flops Again, Heder has made some good flicks. His more prominent movies, such as Just Like Heaven and Monster House, met with financial success, critical praise, or some combination of the two. But if you look at his filmography, those are the exceptions to the rule. Most of his films, like Mama's Boy or Bling, were greeted with critical wrath or outright indifference. Even worse, the majority have made very little money. Whether or not that's Heder's fault, his name's attached to those projects. He's not really a nerd Take away the hair, the glasses, and the \"Vote for Pedro\" T-shirt, and Heder looks nothing like the awkward, dweeby heroic nerd fans took him for in Napoleon Dynamite. In real life, Heder resembles a classic, rugged leading man with a five o'clock shadow, square chin, and sharp jawline. Perhaps when the geek masses saw the true Heder, they felt betrayed and turned their backs on him—and suddenly there was no one left to buy tickets to his flicks. He'd rather do voice work Even though we haven't seen that much of Jon Heder, it doesn't mean he's out of the picture. In fact, he's been behind it. Beginning with 2005's Monster House, Heder booked a lot of voice work for video games, animated films, and cartoons, which includes an animated series/quasi-sequel to Napoleon Dynamite. As of this writing, he's completed almost 20 projects of this ilk, and the work seems to be ramping up. It's not surprising, considering his, let's say, distinctive voice. So it could be a matter of him not wanting to bother with Hollywood anymore, just like his other venture... And web series work His prolific voiceover career keeps him busy, but Heder hasn't stayed completely behind the scenes. Like many creative professionals, he's gone to work for himself by taking his talents to the internet. Since 2009, Heder's appeared in several web projects, like the zom-com Woke Up Dead. With these successful ventures, and the sans-studio freedom it affords him, there's no reason for him to bother with Hollywood productions. He's already got all the opportunity he needs. Not enough controversy Jon Heder leads a fairly innocent life. The reason movie watchers are attracted to some celebs—like, say, Lindsay Lohan—is that they're human trainwrecks. Or film fans clamor for a star who's overcome a serious, debilitating problem, like Robert Downey, Jr. Either way, studios love this—after all, there's no such thing as bad publicity. Heder's never had any problems like this. Nothing sensational ever occurred in his life. In fact, he's even made sure to stay away from potential projects because he believed they'd attract the wrong kind of attention, and conflicted with his Mormon faith. He might be so squeaky clean that there's nothing for ticket buyers to stick to. What's next If he wants, Jon Heder could revive his career easily, and he doesn't have to compromise his values at all. As a father of three, it should be a piece of cake for this indie star to develop a project that appeals to audiences of all ages without being cringe-inducingly corny. And seeing as how he's worked in multiple platforms, it's pretty much up to him how he gets his productions to the people. Or, if nothing like that pans out, he could always take after Kip and train to become a cage fighter.\n",

            "Paragraph: It has been a mystery why some people love some vegetables like broccoli, while others find it to be bitter, even though most people have the same genes for bitter taste receptors. Now scientists may have found the missing link -- it's not only people's genetic makeup that determines people's reaction to broccoli's bitter taste, but also how these genes are instructed to make taste receptors, according to a new study published today (Sept. 11) in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The most-studied gene for bitter taste receptor, TASR38, comes in two types. People who have only one type or the other may be at the extremes -- they are either very sensitive to bitterness, or don't taste it unless it's very strong. But most people are somewhere in between, having one copy of each type. However, even within this group of \"moderate tasters\" who have the same genes, there is greatly varied sensitivity to bitterness. [Tip of the Tongue: The 7 (Other) Flavors Humans May Taste] In the study, 18 people with the same bitter taste genes rated the bitterness level of several beverages, including broccoli juice and carrot juice. The researchers took small samples of tissue from the participants' taste buds. Taste buds, small bumps that cover the tongue, contain taste receptors. The researchers measured the amount of a molecule in the taste buds, called messenger RNA (mRNA), which contains instructions for making bitter taste receptors. The results showed a direct relationship between how much mRNA people's cells made, and their bitterness ratings of broccoli juice. People who had the most mRNA for bitter taste receptor rated the juice as most bitter. \"The amount of messenger RNA that taste cells choose to make may be the missing link in explaining why some people with 'moderate taster' genes still are extremely sensitive to bitterness in foods and drinks,\" said study researcher Danielle Reed, a geneticist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. The findings shows a new level of complexity in taste perception, and may ultimately lend insight into individual differences in food preferences and dietary choices, the researchers said. Although the finding has solved one mystery, it has opened the door to new questions.\n",

            "Paragraph: The ability to shop for clothing online is a miraculous development of the Internet age, a blessing to women everywhere... except for one thing: A lot of the time, it just really doesn't work. Clothes, particularly hard-to-fit items like pants or bras, are difficult to buy online without trying them on first. So several websites, including Qvit.com, are trying to fix that by making the online shopping process as close to the in-store shopping process as possible. Qvit.com's unique development is the use of personalized avatars, allowing shoppers to \"try on\" clothes on an avatar resembling their exact bodies so they can see how the garments will look and even feel. The idea, says co-founder Laura Pastrana, came when she was in college. Dorming with a \"shopaholic\" friend who \"ordered and returned, ordered and returned everything she bought,\" Laura and her friends couldn't believe there wasn't a better way to see how clothing fit before ordering them online. \"We wanted to have a figure that replicated your body and that allows you to try garments on yourself, so like a virtual you, to see how a garment fits,\" Pastrana said in an interview with HuffPost Style. After years of development, in 2013 they finally came up with an avatar, a custom replica of the shopper's body, that allows her to try clothes in three different ways: 1. \"Mirror Image\" Gives the shopper a straightforward reflection of exactly what she looks like in the clothes, down to her customizable skin color. 2. \"Transparency\" Makes the clothes see-through so the shopper can see how closely or baggily they lay on her body. 3. \"The Heat Map\" Shows how tightly or loosely a garment fits with colors not unlike topography (red means \"so tight you can barely breathe,\" blue means \"there is more than one inch between the item and your body\"). The beauty of a customizable avatar, says Pastrana, is that it doesn't rely on predetermined body \"types\" so often used to guide women's shopping choices, i.e. if you're pear-shaped, buy this; if you're ruler-shaped, buy this. \"We're not looking for what designers believe is the perfect fit,\" Pastrana told HuffPost Style. \"We're rather looking for more of a desired fit, i.e. how I want to take it or how I want to wear it, how it reflects my lifestyle or my look or even my mood.\" She added, \"Sometimes, we women go 'Today I feel fat' or 'I feel ugly, so I want something more loose.' So it's usually not about what fits you exactly as much as what you want to wear.\" Amen to that. Qvit.com, which features a boutique-style selection of clothes for both men and women, ranging from $100 - $400, joins a group of e-commerce ventures such as My Virtual Model and \"Swivel\" by Facecake that aim to improve upon the online dressing room experience. Whether high-tech advancements such as avatars and stop-motion technology will ever make online shopping as appealing and user-friendly as the real life, in-person thing still remains to be seen.\n",

            "Paragraph: A series of Martian craters assumed to have been formed by meteorites may actually be extinct volcanoes so massive that, when they were active billions of years ago, they could have buried Mars in ash. The craters pepper the surface of Arabia Terra, a geologically ancient region of northern Mars. They appear as several huge circular pits that resemble Earth's calderas, in which magma beneath a volcano drains after a volcanic eruption, causing the ground above the magma chamber to collapse. The best example on Mars is a feature called Eden patera, a depression about 85 kilometers long, 55 kilometers wide and 1.8 kilometers deep, says Joseph Michalski, a researcher jointly at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and at the Natural History Museum in London. Using data from several satellites orbiting Mars, Michalski and his colleague Jacob Bleacher, a volcanologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, mapped Eden patera in detail. Eden patera is the best example of suspected supervolcanoes on Mars. Its caldera is shown here as a gray bullseye. In a report in Nature today, they describe three separate calderas within the depression, along with possible signs of a lake of solidified lava and a volcanic vent where lava could have oozed out. \"I just don’t think it’s an impact crater,\" Michalski says. Another possible explanation is that underground ice could have melted and formed the depression, but ice typically isn’t known to form such big features. Rubble raisers Rather, Michalski and Bleacher argue that an entirely new category of volcanoes once existed on Mars: ones that rivalled supervolcanoes on Earth, such as that underlying Yellowstone National Park in the western United States. Researchers suspect that Eden patera and other extinct supervolcanoes may have once spewed out enough ash to cover much of Mars in their rubble. Supervolcanoes are loosely defined as those that erupt at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and other debris in a single blast. Given their dimensions, Martian supervolcanoes such as Eden could have spewed out enough ash to cover much of Mars in their rubble, Michalski says. No one had recognized these features as supervolcanoes until now because researchers thought that the giant depressions were just eroded impact craters, Michalski says. The idea is likely to stir controversy. \"I wouldn’t say I’m convinced, but it’s certainly a plausible idea worth getting out there,\" says Brian Hynek, a planetary geologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who has studied how volcanic material is spread around Mars. A close-up view of Eden patera's floor shows layers that formed when lava in an ancient lake attached to the floor of the volcanic crater, froze against the bedrock and then broke away as the lake drained. These ancient volcanoes would have been fundamentally different from others on Mars. The planet’s famous Olympus Mons, one of the biggest volcanoes in the Solar System at 625 kilometers across, would have quietly oozed lava for billions of years. By contrast, the ancient Arabian volcanoes would have blasted out ash ferociously, perhaps because their magma was wetter or rose through the planet's crust more quickly, Michalski suggests. Either way, the Arabian volcanoes were probably active only in the first billion years of Martian history, and then ceased to erupt. They are likely to have played a big part in the early evolution of Mars, says Hynek — maybe even helping to create environments that were conducive to life. Researchers suspect that Oxus patera, shown here, is a Martian supervolcano.\n",

I was missing out on​ family vacations and life's precious events. ​My overall health wasn't good either: I was diagnosed with acid reflux, diabetes and high blood pressure. I knew I needed to make a change but did I? No. I experimented with programs such as Weight Watchers and Medifast, the cabbage soup diet and Atkins. Within six months to a year of starting my diet, my weight would creep back up to my heaviest. Shopping for clothes was pure hell for me. I ate myself up to a size 5XL and 30-32 blouses, 28-32 pants and 50 bra. I didn't have a lap; I couldn't hold my beautiful grandkids. Breaking Point: Three things: In July 2013, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Dallas and the seat belt barely fit around me. I was so embarrassed and wanted to cry. We decided to stay an extra day to tour the new Dallas stadium, and I couldn't walk the tour with my husband. I was so sick and tired of all the blood pressure, diabetes and acid reflux medicine. I had had enough. I went to dinner to celebrate July birthdays in my family. We all gathered to take pictures. Later that evening as I sat on the couch looking at the picture, I noticed that my husband could barely put his arm around me. I looked at that woman in the picture and asked, \"Who are you?\" I didn't know the woman looking back at me. How I Lost It: The initial start was to remove sugar from my diet, stop late-night eating and start using the gym membership that I had been paying for for two years. I knew I had to do something different this time. I had to find a way to make it work longterm. I knew ​giving up too much and feeling deprived wasn't going to work this time. I looked at every diet plan I'd ever been on and came up with a lifestyle plan that would that fit my daily routine and give me long-term results. Because at the end of every diet, you've got to get back to real life. For the first 30 days, I didn't eat any potatoes, pasta, white rice, flour, soda or sugar, and I drank no less than a gallon of water a day. I've learned to read labels. My meals consisted of baked chicken, fish and vegetables. As much as I try to stay away from processed foods, in some cases, it's hard to avoid, so moderation is the key. I make my own snacks, like roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, cashews and roasted chickpeas. I lost 20 pounds in 30 days and started going to the gym. I was sore for ​three months straight, but I kept going every day. Even after losing 20 pounds, I could only walk on the treadmill at the lowest speed, but I kept going. I would be on it for an hour, take a break and get right back on. I stuck with the treadmill for the first nine months. Now, I love going to the gym, and my energy level is off the charts. Everybody who knows me is cheering me on. I want to do everything: Spinning, dancing, running, horseback riding, traveling the world. Now, I can walk on the treadmill on its highest level for 45 to 50 minutes. For someone who could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being winded, I feel like I got my life back! I'm no longer on any of the medications. One year later, my husband said, \"I bet you can run that Dallas stadium now!\" After Weight: 169 pounds\n",

On one day in June last year, a public experiment was conducted in Perth, Australia to find out how people would respond when they were invited to share eye contact with a stranger for a full minute. What happens next is surprisingly poignant. Although no words were spoken, many participants found themselves getting quite emotional. In the quiet moments they shared with the person sitting opposite, it was almost as though they came to a mutual understanding. Watch the heartwarming experiment unfold below. The video, which has since gone viral, was created by a social activist collective called The Liberators International . Founded by artist Peter Sharp, the organisation describe their mission as, \"To involve people in participatory acts of freedom that allow us to see that beyond our differences there is love and humanity.\" Holding someone’s gaze can reveal intimate details about emotions and intentions. It’s hardly surprising then that many find eye contact to be more powerful than words. It’s a formula that SBS is putting to the test in a unique new upcoming documentary series that explores the power of eye contact. ...And we want YOU to participate. Is there a painful rift between you and a family member? Have you grown distant from a friend you used to care about? Has a close relationship ended and you don’t know how to move on? SBS are looking for people who genuinely want to reconcile after years apart to participate in a compelling new TV documentary series. Look Me in the Eye is produced by Endemol Shine for SBS. How long can YOU hold eye contact with someone before it gets weird? Maintaining eye contact for a sustained length of time can be hard – especially with a stranger. How long can you last?

            "Topic: This Guy Shared His Distraught Ex Classmate's Story & We Bet, That You'll Know Someone Like Her\n",
            "Paragraph: Life in a world governed by inhibitions can be taxing. You're constantly oppressed, devoid of fundamental rights, and asked to give away your wishes for nought.  But even after all these years of relentless struggle, it will take some time for a change to come along. Speaking of a similar case, this guy shared a story of his ex-classmate in a series of tweets. The story speaks about how an erudite individual became someone's housewife. It speaks about how, thousands of girls every year, give up on their career, education, intelligence, potential, and capacity because they get married.  And while marriage may have nothing to do with what you do with your career, in the recent years, it has emerged as something which says otherwise.  Something's been pinching me for some days now. Thought of letting it out of my system by sharing it here. Here goes....... Read the full story here: 1. There was this girl in my school, back in 90's. Brilliant, studious, hard working, very confident, a topper, a debater, a class prefect.... 2. We were class fellows. She was the kind of girl with whom boys talked after rehearsing. Despite mad competition between us, we were friends. 3. I guess the proudest moments of my school and college life were whenever I scored better than her in exams. Couldn't beat her in confidence 4. We both chose engineering after college and graduated. I chose to work in an industry and she chose to pursue Masters in engineering. 5. Later, she joined one of the best universities of the country as a lecturer in Engineering. That's when her parents decided to marry her off 6. An arranged marriage in a well off family meant that she had to quit job & live as a house wife. This wasn't all, guy was a college dropout. 7. She resisted as much as she could. But after sometime, she agreed to everything saying, \"my parents are too old& scared of me being single\". 8. Parents, too old and too scared. That was the reason for this brilliant girl to give up all her dreams, her ego and her career. 9. The guy was nearly an uneducated, spoiled brat of a business family who couldn't stomach a woman having an education, or an opinion, or ego. 10. In no time after her wedding she realized that he was verbally and physically abusive and his family supported and encouraged all this. 11. But she kept quiet in the face of all abuse because her parents were too old and too scared. 12. She had no money to spend on herself and her husband never bothered to give her a penny. She had already quit her job. So there was no way. 13. Very recently she texted me that her husband had beaten her and given her talaaq twice and if after two times talaaq she could live with him 14. Shocked, I asked why would she live with a man so abusive and so insulting. Her reply was, \"My parents are too old.... sick and scared.\" Most women these days are still shackled by what their family thinks and what their family wants. In retrospect, it is always a good option to leave your job/career/life for a good marriage. But why?  Girls! Your parents love you. But one day, they will be old, sick and scared. DO NOT QUIT YOUR CAREER FOR MARRIAGE. Earn you own money. It does not matter if you're thirty or thirty five, do not marry, I say DO NOT MARRY a man you feel is unsuitable for you. Marriage shouldn't happen at the cost of your career. Both of them stand mutually exclusive of each other and it should be kept that way. In today's times, it is extremely integral for an individual, be it a man or a woman, to have a career, to have a constant source of earning, to be independent, and most importantly, to be financially stable.  Parents! One day, you will be old, sick and scared. Please raise your daughters as persons and not as commodity. Let them work and earn. Teach your girls to live on their own and never depend on a man for their survival. Do not force them to marry if there is no compatibility. Wait for your dream man, but do not wait for him to pay your bills. Just because most women don't have a free-flow of income, they chose to stay in an abusive relationship.  But you don't deserve that. None of us does.  And it is a humble request to all the parents, to stop forcing girls into marrying someone just because they are hitting that age.  Parents! Don't panic if your girl is in 30's & single. Let her pursue her dreams. Don't blackmail your girl for marriage. This isn't love. Girls! Do not be blackmailed in the name of family, honor or parents. You are the ones who have to live with the man, YOU decide. Speak for yourself and take care of yourself. And if you know anyone who's going through this, please help them.  Parents! Teach your sons to respect women. Teach them that they're marrying a human being and they're equals. Let your daughter-in-law work.\n",

            "Paragraph: When moving into a new house, Imgur user CzarMatt and his wife didn't expect to stumble upon a mind-blowing secret hidden in one of their new home's closets. While moving all their stuff into their new house, Matt stacked some boxes into an empty closet, not paying much attention to the floor. While Matt was pretty oblivious to the secret hiding under the cardboard boxes, his wife noticed a panel in the floor and said to him, \"Did you know we had a trapdoor?\" Super curious, they quickly moved the boxes out of the way and Matt tried the handle...hoping not to find any dead bodies below. The trapdoor opened easy but it looked like there was nothing but dust to be found down there. But wait...what's that hiding in the corner?! A box! This intricate little box was sitting on plastic sheeting. They tried to open it only to realize it was locked tight. Not having any idea how old and delicate it was they decided not to force it open and risk ruining the box itself. It was surprisingly heavy. Since the keyhole appeared to be intact, Matt decided to leave the box and call up a locksmith friend for help. Here's a close-up of the keyhole. After finding out his locksmith friend wasn't coming to explore the unopened box, overly curious Matt decided he had to try to force it open and see what was hiding inside. He grabbed his tools and got to work! Using a screwdriver and a hammer, Matt got the box open in no time at all. Oh wow! It was a little treasure chest! What excited Matt and his wife the most was when they found a tiny box within the bigger one. This probably explains why the thing was so heavy... Here's a close-up of some of the coins, including a British 50 pence coin. Some of the coins appeared to be very old, and on closer inspection... ...they saw that yes, they were old! This one was over 130 years old! This one cent coin was incredibly from 1859. Most of the coins were American, but there were some from all corners of the world. While looking through the coins, Matt's wife spotted something else... It was this awesome retro Silver Surfer card in a protective case. While the coins and card were cool, there was something else in there... ...that other tiny box! What's that? Seems like this box had been outfitted with some serious tiny-lock technology. Luckily, Matt's wife found the key among all the coins... Tiny mystery boxeth unlocketh! Those better not be tiny body bags... Nope! Just protective bags for all that bling! What a beautiful old collection of pocket watches, chains, and a ring. It looked like two of the three watches were still functioning. This ring with the old Girl Scout logo was also in the tiny box. While Matt and his wife were super giddy over their amazing little treasure find, their dog couldn't have cared less. You don't see that every day. A mystery box that actually had cool things in it!'\n",

That’s what the tabloids are wondering after the actress was spotted with a handsome hunk said to be her financial advisor.can exclusively reveal what’s really going on. Garner was \"spotted with the finance fox outside of office hours on June 4 at SoHo House in Malibu,\" writes Star . A so-called \"spy\" is quoted as saying, \"They were with a friend, but Jen didn’t seem to care. She had on the biggest grin, batting her lashes and giggling at all of his jokes. She just melted.\" The magazine even describes Garner as \"acting more like a googly-eyed teen\" than a mother of three. And what about estranged husband Ben Affleck? \"Ben knows he doesn’t have a leg to stand on, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t jealous,\" a supposed \"pal\" claims. \"He’s got his eye on this guy.\" Uh, actually, he doesn’t, and he doesn’t need to. There is nothing going on between Garner and the man Star can’t even identify by name. Gossip Cop has exclusively learned that the guy in question is actually the husband of Garner’s longtime manager. What’s more is that he isn’t even the star’s accountant. Basically, Star took a photo of Garner, ignored the fact that the aforementioned \"friend\" with her was her manager, and tried to make it look like she was dating someone who is very much married. And that means the Affleck quotes are either made up or from a very misinformed \"pal.\" In any case, the tabloid couldn’t be more wrong here.\n",

Outside of helping with constipation, decreasing inflammation, helping you with cholesterol levels—or just generally being a tasty fruit—pears are reportedly perfect with helping avoid the possibility of a hangover. The consumption of the fruit can help reduce alcohol levels significantly. Of course, they should be consumed in advance, preferably towards the end of your long, drunken night, in order to be effective. Researchers suggest that Korean pear juice is the most effective, and that the most significant impact it has seen is helping subjects' under the influence increase their concentration levels. The study, conducted by Professor Manny Noakes, revealed that the enzymes that come with alcohol metabolism can be effected by the consumption of pears, which helps the body metabolize alcohol faster, or even eliminate it. \"In particular, reductions were seen in blood acetaldehyde levels, the toxic metabolic thought to be responsible for hangover symptoms,\" she says in an interview with Quartz. So the next time you want to get some late night, drunk grub, make sure you Google Map the nearest 24 hour grocery store and grab you and your squad some pears. [via Quartz]\n",

            "Paragraph: A customer dining at Ankar’s Hoagles in Chattanooga, Tennessee (US) noticed that the cook was suffering from Down syndrome and so s/he decided to report the said worker to the health department. Instead of talking with the restaurant’s owner and manager (trust me, she should’ve done that), she’d rather file an official complaint against the worker. But when the health department came to the restaurant, they were shocked to discover that the ‘worker’ with Down syndrome was actually the restaurant’s manager and co-owner! Apparently, shortly after his father died, Andrew took over and started becoming a manager that every worker loved. But as seen in the picture, despite being the manager and co-owner, Andrew works tirelessly. He cooks, and serves, and practically does every worker in his restaurant does. His brother Alex shared a picture of his hardworking brother on Instagram, which instantly gained much love from many netizens. He captioned the picture with this: Ever since my dad passed away, my little bro has been working day in and day out at Ankar’s Hoagie’s to ensure that my father’s legacy keeps going strong. From greeting customers to cleaning the dining room to working the grill, Andrew works tirelessly to make sure our business is a success – and he does it all with a smile on his face. When I learned that someone had the audacity to file a report with the local health inspector over an adult with Down syndrome being in the kitchen of a restaurant that he is not just employed at, but that he owns, I was floored. It makes my blood boil that there are people in this world who don’t have an ounce of kindness in their heart to appreciate what an amazing person he is. The fact that there are people out there in this world that view people with disabilities as sub-human disgusts me. Sometimes I sit back and marvel at Andrew’s ability to love everyone... even people who aren’t deserving of his kindness. He knows no hate. If the people out there who constantly ridicule people with disabilities had even half of Andrew’s capability to love EVERYONE, this world would be a better place. I challenge every single person who reads this to take a minute to put all differences aside. Whether it’s ability, race, sexual orientation, religion, whatever – try to put your differences aside and love one another. Trust me, the world would be a much better place if everyone had Andrew’s ability. He’s not the disabled one, we are. Love you, kid.\n",

HBO Finally, after teasing the confrontation all season, last night’s episode of Game of Thrones saw Jon Snow face off against the vile Ramsay Bolton. The two Northerners battled in the courtyard of Winterfell, after the largest and most brutal battle in Thrones history, and Jon ended up beating the bastard into a bloody pulp. It was a wonderfully cathartic moment to see the usually cocky and sneering Ramsay get his just desserts but it was anything but wonderful for poor Iwan Rheon. HBO Kit Harington admitted during filming he may have got a bit too in character accidentally hitting Iwan not once but twice while miming his punches, according to the Evening Standard He said: I actually did punch Iwan in the face, twice, by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it. I had to buy him a pint after that one. Thankfully Iwan doesn’t share his characters love of skinning men alive and laughed off the accident joking: \"Jaw hurt a bit the next day, but, you know, it’s understandable.\" Harington also revealed that he thinks Jon goes a bit too far while beating Ramsay’s face into a fine paste. He said: It’s a horrible moment when you see your hero go a bit too far. The audience should feel, ‘Yes! Yes! Ramsay’s getting what he deserves! He’s still getting what he deserves, this is- OK, stop. Could you stop now? That’s fair enough Kit but I can’t say I didn’t smile a little when the show’s biggest bell-end since Joffrey got what was coming to him.\n",

            "Topic: 6 Tips To Be More Spontaneous While Clicking Candid Photographs\n",
            "Paragraph: Moments and emotions are usually best captured when the subject is totally unaware, without striking clichéd camera poses. This is when the beauty of the subject is portrayed in a truly genuine sense. Be it a person, an object or even a random street, clicking a candid photograph always tells the story behind the picture! Now, clicking candid doesn’t mean that you should go crazy and haywire with the camera. You need to remember that being spontaneous and tactful is the way to get the best candid shots. Here are some tips that you must know. 1. Set your camera settings so that you can forget about it for the rest of your photography session. When you are in a place where you want to enjoy and click as well, this is the first thing you need to do. Set your camera on Aperture priority mode where the camera will choose a shutter speed to give the right exposure while you control the ISO and aperture, or on Shutter priority mode wherein you can control the shutter speed. Depending on the location, you can adjust your shooting modes.  2. Find the right frame through your eyes first and then through the viewfinder.   Again, the fun in clicking candid shots is only when you are able to spot the right frames with your own eyes (because only your eyes can capture the story behind the picture). Avoid getting distracted by constantly looking through the camera’s viewfinder. Instead, once you spot the right frame, move the viewfinder to your eye and click effortlessly in the exact frame which you saw through your eyes.  3. Shoot multiple shots at the same spot.  Don’t be satisfied with just one click when it comes to candid photography. Instead, just put on your camera on continuous shooting mode. Shoot in bursts of multiple images because facial reactions and movements continually keep changing. So, you never know when you might get that one awesome shot.  4. Switch off the flash to avoid distraction.  Generally, people get conscious of the camera if they spot flashes clicking on them, and you might just miss the whole point of clicking candid pictures. They would either start posing or just run away from the camera! To increase the lighting, either you can increase the ISO, aperture or shutter speed.  5. Find your angle.  Clicking from a different angle and a lower height than your usual 5-6 feet eye-level will always give you a more relaxed perspective. You can keep your subject unaware this way as you capture them in their eased-out moments. You might just need to use a wider angle in this case.  6. Stand far and use a long zoom lens instead.  The key is to just capture even the most beautiful moments without an ounce of disturbance. So, you can just stand at a distance and use the double zoom kit of Canon EOS 1300D which comes with EF-S 18-55mm IS II + EF-S 55-250mm IS II. This will help you not look creepy, and help you get the best shots.  When it comes to photography, the most refined and amazing shots can be clicked if you have a DSLR with the finest features. Canon's EOS 1300D is exclusively built for first-time DSLR users. In fact, it packs multiple features which will give one some real fun of photography. Be it the smart transfer on social media via Wi-Fi, continuous shooting, remote shooting or different shooting modes which you can play with, this DSLR is built for you to enjoy photography. Give your passion a kickstart by getting one before you start capturing all those beautiful and candid moments.\n",

It's bad enough that we have the global media claiming some of our biggest actors, directors, writers and artists are English, but when it comes to films and TV shows we have a distinctive flair when it comes to producing art. 2015's release of Brooklyn, a film directed by director John Crowley and based on the novel written by our very own Colm Tóibín saw Carlow native Saoirse Ronan fill the main role of Eilis, which in turn led her to be nominated for an Oscar. As Brooklyn began gathering momentum in 2015, it lead many people to assume it was a British film however considering the direction, the lead actor and the original writer of the story are Irish, we would consider it 100% our own.

Twitter user Aoife Lawlor notified us to the scandalous placement of our favourite film. Twitter user Paulie B also found the same result while on a flight, which is extremely disheartening. Being the nosy parker I am, I logged onto my own Netflix and found that, it is in fact, listed under British movies... Meanwhile, the search 'Irish movies' even more sadly, holds no movies at all.

            "Topic: Undocumented Immigrant Population Estimated At 11.7 Million\n",
            "Paragraph: WASHINGTON -- The undocumented immigrant population rose to an estimated 11.7 million in 2012, up from 11.5 million one year before, according to a Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends Project report released Monday. As Congress considers whether to give a path to citizenship -- or just legal status -- to undocumented immigrants, the numbers could make a difference in showing how many people are in the U.S. and who might be allowed to stay, should reform pass at all. The numbers also show that laws meant to drive away undocumented immigrants, such as Arizona's SB 1070 in 2010, did not lead to a broad decrease in the general undocumented population, despite lawmakers' intentions. The undocumented population declined during the recession, as many people left or decided not to come at all due to the bad economic climate. There were an estimated 12.2 undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, but the number decreased to 11.3 million by 2009, according to Pew. Pew noted that the increase in its estimate doesn't necessarily mean a huge increase in the undocumented population, or that the trends have definitively reversed. \"Although there are indications the number of unauthorized immigrants may be rising, the 2012 population estimate is the midpoint of a wide range of possible values and in a statistical sense is no different from the 2009 estimate,\" the report reads. After 2007, Pew found that the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico -- about half of the total undocumented population in 2012 -- had decreased at higher rates than the general group. There are now about 6.05 million Mexican undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to the Pew 2012 estimate. Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at Pew, explains how researchers estimate the unauthorized population here. It's not clear how many undocumented immigrants would actually seek citizenship if given the chance. Pew put out a report in June noting that although most Hispanic immigrants say they want to become citizens, only 46 percent who currently could become citizens have done so. Nearly half of those who did not become citizens despite eligibility said it was either for personal reasons or administrative ones, such as the high cost, according to a 2012 Pew report. Still, a strong majority -- more than 90 percent -- of Latino immigrants who had not naturalized said then that they would become citizens if they could. The June report also noted that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- which grants two years reprieve from deportation concerns to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children -- saw a sizable number of applications, but not as many as Pew researchers estimated would be eligible. The Senate passed a bill in June that would allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventual citizenship, but for now, it's not clear the House of Representatives will pass, or even vote on, such a bill this year. Instead, the House may pursue smaller measures to increase border security and enforcement, legalize undocumented young people and change the high-skilled work visa system. Clarification: This piece has been updated to clarify Pew's adjustments to its 2011 numbers subsequent to the publishing of that year's report. This article previously listed the initial estimate for undocumented immigrants in 2011 as 11.1 million; Pew had since updated its estimate to 11.5.\n",

            "Paragraph: Mindfully approach your week ahead to free yourself from the tyranny of chaos and stress. Sometimes, increasing your productivity level isn't about working faster. It's about getting better organized, so you'll be able to do more in less time and with less stress. Here's how. Determine your key activities for the week. Sit down in a quiet location for 15-20 minutes and plan your week ahead. Write down the key projects and tasks you need or want to accomplish. Consider all the important meetings you're already scheduled to attend. What prep time will you need? For many people, the best times to do this planning is on Friday afternoon or at some point during the weekend. For anyone who gets anxious on Sunday evenings or on Monday mornings thinking about their work week, this short planning period can help alleviate some of those feelings of worry. Block your calendar. Schedule the time you'll need to complete your high-priority tasks and projects. Also, be sure to block any time you'll want to prep for important meetings so you can walk in feeling ready for the discussions. I like to think of this exercise as a way of taking back my time, so I'm better prepared to say No to some requests, delegate others, and push other requests out for future work. Carve out email time. Try setting aside specific times for checking your email throughout the day, such as when you get up, when you arrive at work, right before and after lunch, once in mid-afternoon, before you leave work, and (possibly) one more time in the evening. Then, avoid checking your email when you're in a meeting or when you're working on an important project or task. Switch from multi-tasking to single-tasking. The problem with trying to multi-task is all that shifting back and forth between tasks isn't all that efficient because, each time we do it, it takes our brain some time to refocus. While it might seem efficient on the surface, it isn't  studies show that multi-tasking can reduce productivity by as much as 40%. Prep your attire. Based on your meetings and the key activities for the week, determine the clothes to wear each day and hang the outfits in order, in your closet. Why waste time searching through your closet each morning (while trying not to slosh coffee on your clothes)? Taking a few minutes each weekend to prep your attire will save time and decrease your stress level during the week. Plan your breakfast food. For many people, one of the most stressful times during the work week is getting ready for work. If mornings tend to feel chaotic, take another step toward decreasing stress  by planning breakfast meals ahead of time. If you shop for items on the weekend, you'll also be more likely to have your kitchen stocked with healthy items that you can eat on the go, if necessary. Bonus: Plan some healthy lunch meals you can take to work with you  you'll save time, feel better and save money versus eating out. By mindfully approaching your week ahead, you will free yourself from the tyranny of chaos and stress and can better focus on what's most important.\n",

            "Topic: Why Indie Filmmakers Should Care About Net Neutrality\n",
            "Paragraph: Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith banded together to form United Artists nearly a hundred years ago, with hopes of controlling their own work and liberating it from the studios’ grip. Filmmakers today face similar challenges in gaining control of their work from faceless commercial entities. While there are, of course, more opportunities for creating work than ever before, filmmakers are also increasingly facing roadblocks to getting that work seen by the public. This is where Net Neutrality comes into play. The past generation has seen an explosion in the volume of content consumed over the Internet, accompanied by a lack of infrastructure to support the flow of that information. If there isn’t enough bandwidth for all of the content that a set of subscribers to an ISP (such as Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.) require, then the ISP either has to build additional bandwidth or ration the existing bandwidth. A lack of bandwidth to support video streaming manifests for the viewer as \"buffering\" messages and stuttering playback. These pauses deliver a disappointing experience for the viewer and it can (and will) cause them to seek out a better option. Net Neutrality is important because it affects how and when this rationing occurs. If viewers are already paying for content, they will be hard-pressed to pay a second time to optimize the viewing of that content. At the same time, any content provider (including Fandor) wants to make sure that their customers have the best experience possible and don’t leave the service due to poor quality viewing. The natural progression of rationing is not pretty: those services that have greatest ability to pay will have their content favored by the ISPs. If only filmmakers could simply make great films and have them seen by their eager fans. If only viewers could choose which films they wanted to watch and not have that choice made for them by the companies they pay to deliver content. There’s much to think about when it comes to the control of art and its flow to the public. Unfortunately, as was true a hundred years ago, power still belongs to those that have the money or resources to organize. The Internet has created an amazing opportunity to easily connect people with shared interests. In this case, it’s not just the artists who need to unite, it’s the viewers. The more informed we all are about what the challenges are, the more organized we can be to confront them. Read Aronson’s full post here.\n",

            "Paragraph: The National Anthem is covered by artists time and time again, but even though the original song is timeless, artists sing their renditions in an attempt to make the song memorable and their own. Whitney Houston’s rendition of the Star-Spangled banner at the Super Bowl is considered one of the best performances of the song of all time. With so many incredible artists singing this song, it is difficult to differentiate your version from the rest. However, Chloe and Halle Bailey’s version of the National Anthem at the BET Experience’s Sprite Celebrity Awards is unlike any rendition I have ever heard and it blew the entire audience away. These teen sisters grew up in Atlanta, Georgia but eventually moved to Los Angeles with their family to pursue careers in music. Their YouTube channel is what has really launched them into the music industry, singing incredible covers that garner millions of views. These girls have an insane amount of talent. Their voices show the utmost display of control and skill and they blend together in such a beautiful way. I am simply blown away by their clever harmonies and strategic pauses, it is no wonder they were recently signed to Beyonce’s Parkwood Entertainment. You need to hear this performance for yourself to understand just how amazing it is. It starts off pretty normal, but as soon as they both started singing together, I had goosebumps. I think this pair is making an excellent example for young girls everywhere in empowering them to do what they love and to follow those dreams. I am still in awe by how unique this performance is and I have no doubt that we will be seeing more from Chloe and Halle in the future!\n",

Sarandon, who broke off her 23-year relationship with actor Tim Robbins in 2009, said she hasn’t received many \"offers\" to date recently. \"I haven’t really had a large dating career.

But I think back in the ’60s it just was much more open.\" When the interview shifted to politics, Sarandon said it was important not to cast blame on anyone for the results of November’s presidential election. Sarandon was a vocal supporter of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, and has been a fierce critic of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party in general. \"The important thing right now is that we stop harping on blame because blame, if you really want me to talk about this election – you know, I was not the person who brought Trump into power,\" Sarandon said. \"The DNC has a lot of... there are already suits all over the country about how that was rigged, the primary.\" \"People have to get over what happened, take some personal responsibility for being in a bubble and not paying attention to what was going on in the country, and start applying their anger and their energy to rectifying what’s going on,\" she added.

When members of our armed forces enlist, they do so knowing that there’s a chance they might not come home. In return, it is our duty to honor our vets in life — as in the case of Cpl.

What moves me most is when everyday people take on the solemn responsibility of mourning our veterans after they’ve died, like these bikers who assembled to pay their respects to a soldier whose remains were finally returned after 65 years. But not every soldier gets that kind of heartfelt memorial. That’s why it was so beautiful to see one airline employee take action this past week in honor of one of America’s fallen warriors. Julia Jette and her husband were preparing to board a flight from Anchorage to Seattle on Alaska Airlines, when one of the company’s customer service reps took to the intercom. The employee, Denise Snow, announced that the ashes of a 21-year veteran of the forces would be sharing the flight. Then, she asked permission from the passengers to send him off in a truly beautiful fashion.

            "Topic: How presidents use their portraits to shape their legacy\n",
            "Paragraph: American presidents build their legacies through a vast array of institutions and images. In the months and years after they leave office, presidential libraries are built, official and personal papers preserved, documentaries filmed, houses made into museums and, if the president is Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln or a Roosevelt, mighty statues carved. (Angela Merkel can’t expect anything like that.) And of course, in a time-honored tradition, presidents sit for their portraits. Dozens of presidential portraits hang in the bright halogen wattage of the National Portrait Gallery; 42 grace the White House. Gilbert Stuart set the template when he painted Washington in the rancorous waning years of his presidency. A bust-length version appeared on the $1 bill in 1869 and remains there today, making it the most-reproduced image in history. A full-length version hangs prominently in the East Room of the White House, and every president since John Adams has had to measure himself against the great man’s penetrating gaze. Other presidential portraits followed the precedent of Stuart’s Washington, standing by a desk strewn with books and papers. In the White House, those of Presidents James Polk, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Rutherford Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush are variants of the Washington original. A different presidential image, also pioneered by Stuart, had Thomas Jefferson seated at a desk. Knowing that the projection of personality was at the heart of politics, Jefferson wanted to embody \"chaste republican character\" by being portrayed as a man of the people doing his ordinary daily work. That \"Jeffersonian\" style was adopted in White House portraits of Presidents John Quincy Adams, John Tyler, Grover Cleveland, Franklin Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. As one might expect, these portraits tell stories, and not always true ones; spin has always been a part of any presidential legacy. Though the goal of the presidential portrait is commemorative, at a more ambitious level, it is political: to influence and, if possible, control posterity’s judgment of a president. It’s been this way from the start. In Stuart’s full-length, Washington stands majestically, in a plain black suit by a cluttered desk, dignified and serious, bordering on remote. That hardly described his character. After their first meeting, the startled artist wrote that \"all Washington’s features were indicative of the strongest and most ungovernable passion, and had he been born in the forest, he would have been the fiercest man among the savage tribes.\" On another occasion, Stuart watched the president \"seize a man by the collar and thrust him violently across the room.\" Washington’s \"ungovernable passions,\" as one commentator put it, were well known in 1796. But his lifelong quest was to subdue and redirect that temper, to be known as a leader of prudence and wisdom. For his part, the supremely talented Stuart, who was always aware he was working for the political elite, considered it his job to fashion Washington into that prudent and wise leader. He painted more than 100 portraits of Washington, in which he is repeatedly encountered as the Republic’s iconic chief of state. Stuart’s brilliance was not just a matter of artistic technique; it was also an ability — and a willingness — to be political choreographer for the strategic desires of the presidents he served: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe. Never did he consider himself an independent political voice. Washington clearly recognized Stuart’s value in his long-term project of legacy-building. Explaining his logic to a skeptical Lafayette, Washington said that artists and writers \"hold the keys of the gate by which Patriots, Sages and Heroes are admitted to immortality;\" they are the \"doorkeepers to the temple of fame.\" And of all the artists and writers shepherding Washington toward that temple, it was Stuart who, better than anyone else, crafted the imposing image that has endured for 220 years. A number of other presidents have used talented artists to project their public image. Ronald Reagan, in a portrait by Everett Kinstler, radiated his renowned affability. Seated on the Truman balcony of the White House, he is the only president positioned out of doors, smiling so broadly that his teeth show. But not all official portraitists followed the wishes of presidents, and presidents sometimes sat for painters without complete foreknowledge of what would emerge on the canvas. Theodore Roosevelt originally had himself painted by a Frenchman who, it was said, made the former Rough Rider look like a \"Mewing Cat.\" Roosevelt had the painting destroyed, and then hired John Singer Sargent — another artist who knew how to amplify a client’s desires — to paint him standing on a staircase, latching one hand onto his hip, flaring his elbow, looking dead ahead and grasping a newel post as if the Earth itself were under his command. Rarely has an official portraitist had the temerity to paint something that would be an open embarrassment to the sitter. Graham Sutherland’s controversial 1954 portrait of Winston Churchill was merely harsh. But Nelson Shanks’s portrait of Bill Clinton is hostile. Shanks deposited a poison pill into his portrait of Clinton at the National Portrait Gallery: the shadow of Monica Lewinsky’s dress, cast onto a nearby fireplace. Over that fireplace, a portrait of Washington is cropped at the neck, as if the first president would prefer to look away from the unseemliness. Shanks’s goal, we can infer, was to be doorkeeper to the temple of infamy. He doubled the inappropriateness when he let Clinton review and accept the picture before revealing its humiliating content. Then tripling the stakes, he declared the president \"probably the most famous liar of all time.\" Though the cost of the Clinton portrait is unknown, Shanks has received as much as $200,000 for a full-length portrait, a lot to be paid for public mortification. Maureen Dowd called it \"devilish punking,\" which it would be in a political cartoon. But in an official presidential portrait, it registers more like a toxic brew of passive aggression and political opportunism. President Obama’s official portrait has yet to be painted. Over the centuries, the acquisition date of a presidential portrait has varied widely (Herbert Hoover’s was painted 23 years after he left office), but more recently it has occurred during the next president’s term, when the sharpest political and personal comparisons can be made. We can speculate on what Obama’s portrait might look like, whether he will be standing or sitting, introspective or gregarious, a doer or a thinker. The format might be traditional or original, the artist African American or not. But whatever the format or whoever the artist, the occasion will be momentous. The portrait will join a presidential cavalcade that includes those who worked for the civil rights that made Obama’s election possible: Lyndon Johnson, Ulysses Grant, John Quincy Adams and Abraham Lincoln. At the same time it will stand as a permanent rebuke to all those who stoked the flames of racism, most egregiously Andrew Johnson, Woodrow Wilson, James Polk and John Tyler. Obama will need to think long and hard on what his artist should do for him. He will need to start a dialogue, discuss preliminary sketches and take a hand in shaping his legacy. His portrait, after all, will be less about what his presidency means, and more about what he wishes to say about himself.\n",

            "Paragraph: After calling out makers of cars and air conditioners, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has set his sights on a new industry to pressure for manufacturing jobs: drug companies. In his first press conference since his election, Trump lumped pharmaceutical firms in with the car companies that so far have borne the brunt of his Twitter feed for moving operations abroad. \"We’ve got to get our drug industry back,\" he said. \"They supply our drugs but they don’t make them here, to a large extent.\" Afterward, pharmaceutical stocks around the world plunged, partly on Trump’s promise to cut drug prices but also on concerns that companies could face the same choice he’s proposed for carmakers: make it in the U.S. or face punitive tariffs. For the most part, no. About 75 percent of U.S. spending on drugs is for products that are manufactured domestically. The expiration dates on medicines mean it pays to be nearer to the end consumer. Being close to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a tightly regulated industry doesn’t hurt either. Nevertheless, because of the sheer size of the American market -- the biggest in the world by far -- the $86 billion of medicine brought in from the rest of the world in 2015 still makes the U.S. the biggest drug importer on the planet. The value of those imports has almost doubled since 2005. In 2015, the U.S.’s top five sources of pharmaceutical imports by value were Ireland, Germany, the U.K., Switzerland and India. With the exception of India, those countries aren’t exactly places to find cheap labor. Yet Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland are home to some of the world’s biggest research-based pharmaceutical companies, firms that develop new drugs and then manufacture what they design. Germany and Switzerland are also headquarters to the two largest contract manufacturers for biological medicines. Whereas most drugs are chemically synthesized, biologics come from human, animal or micro-organism sources and require a great deal of know-how and high-tech equipment to make. Ireland is the biggest source of U.S. imports, accounting for $25 billion of drugs in 2015. It has emerged as a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing largely in the past decade as its low corporate tax rate and other incentives attracted $8 billion in investment. Nine of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations in Ireland. The country’s tax policies have proved so attractive to drug and medical-device companies that some, including Allergan, Medtronic and Shire, have made Dublin their legal address. The U.S. may have put a stop to these so-called tax inversions with rule changes last year. After the Treasury issued the revisions, U.S.-based Pfizer and AbbVie abandoned their planned mergers with Irish-based companies. India represents a different case from the European countries on the list. Rather than producing small volumes of high-priced, innovative medicines, Indian companies specialize in large volumes of cheap generics. These are copies of drugs whose U.S. patent protection has expired. Generics are essentially a commodity where the producer with the lowest production cost wins the market. They now make up eight of 10 prescriptions filled in the U.S., though because they are so much less expensive than branded drugs they account for only about 22 percent of total spending on pharmaceuticals. With manufacturing costs in India as much as 50 percent lower than in Western industrialized countries, India has become the biggest exporter of generics in the world. Sales of generic medicines in the U.S. reached $70 billion in 2015, and that’s expected to grow as more medicines go off patent. The Indians and Chinese say Americans would pay higher prices if they made more of their own generics and drug components. That would put Trump in a bind given that he’s also said he wants to bring down prices. In the U.S., the cost of a generic drug, the kind that India specializes in producing, is estimated to be 80 percent to 85 percent lower than that of the brand-name equivalent. In 2010 alone, the FDA estimates, the use of generic drugs in the U.S. saved $158 billion, or $3 billion every week.\n",

According to the Daily Mail's sources, Craig has said he is \"done\" playing Bond, despite MGM offering the huge sum for him to return for two more films beyond Spectre, including endorsements, profit shares and even a co-producer credit. Craig has reportedly earned £38 million total for the four Bond films he has made so far. Last year, Craig said he'd rather \"slash my wrists\" than play Bond again, but added that \"If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\" Apparently, even that wasn't enough.

            "Topic: The Day I Stopped Saying 'Hurry Up'\n",
            "Paragraph: When you're living a distracted life, every minute must be accounted for. You feel like you must be checking something off the list, staring at a screen, or rushing off to the next destination. And no matter how many ways you divide your time and attention, no matter how many duties you try and multi-task, there's never enough time in a day to ever catch up. That was my life for two frantic years. My thoughts and actions were controlled by electronic notifications, ring tones, and jam-packed agendas. And although every fiber of my inner drill sergeant wanted to be on time to every activity on my overcommitted schedule, I wasn't. You see, six years ago I was blessed with a laid-back, carefree, stop-and-smell-the roses type of child. When I needed to be out the door, she was taking her sweet time picking out a purse and a glittery crown. When I needed to be somewhere five minutes ago, she insisted on buckling her stuffed animal into a car seat. When I needed to grab a quick lunch at Subway, she'd stop to speak to the elderly woman who looked like her grandma. When I had 30 minutes to get in a run, she wanted me to stop the stroller and pet every dog we passed. When I had a full agenda that started at 6:00 a.m., she asked to crack the eggs and stir them ever so gently. My carefree child was a gift to my Type A, task-driven nature --but I didn't see it. Oh no, when you live life distracted, you have tunnel vision -- only looking ahead to what's next on the agenda. And anything that cannot be checked off the list is a waste of time. Whenever my child caused me to deviate from my master schedule, I thought to myself, \"We don't have time for this.\" Consequently, the two words I most commonly spoke to my little lover of life were: \"Hurry up.\" I started my sentences with it. Hurry up, we're gonna be late. I ended sentences with it. We're going to miss everything if you don't hurry up. I started my day with it. Hurry up and eat your breakfast. Hurry up and get dressed. I ended my day with it. Hurry up and brush your teeth. Hurry up and get in bed. And although the words \"hurry up\" did little if nothing to increase my child's speed, I said them anyway. Maybe even more than the words, \"I love you.\" The truth hurts, but the truth heals... and brings me closer to the parent I want to be. Then one fateful day, things changed. We'd just picked my older daughter up from kindergarten and were getting out of the car. Not going fast enough for her liking, my older daughter said to her little sister, \"You are so slow.\" And when she crossed her arms and let out an exasperated sigh, I saw myself -- and it was a gut-wrenching sight. I was a bully who pushed and pressured and hurried a small child who simply wanted to enjoy life. My eyes were opened; I saw with clarity the damage my hurried existence was doing to both of my children. Although my voice trembled, I looked into my small child's eyes and said, \"I am so sorry I have been making you hurry. I love that you take your time, and I want to be more like you.\" Both my daughters looked equally surprised by my painful admission, but my younger daughter's face held the unmistakable glow of validation and acceptance. \"I promise to be more patient from now on,\" I said as I hugged my curly-haired child who was now beaming at her mother's newfound promise. It was pretty easy to banish \"hurry up\" from my vocabulary. What was not so easy was acquiring the patience to wait on my leisurely child. To help us both, I began giving her a little more time to prepare if we had to go somewhere. And sometimes, even then, we were still late. Those were the times I assured myself that I will be late only for a few years, if that, while she is young. When my daughter and I took walks or went to the store, I allowed her to set the pace. And when she stopped to admire something, I would push thoughts of my agenda out of my head and simply observe her. I witnessed expressions on her face that I'd never seen before. I studied dimples on her hands and the way her eyes crinkled up when she smiled. I saw the way other people responded to her stopping to take time to talk to them. I saw the way she spotted the interesting bugs and pretty flowers. She was a Noticer, and I quickly learned that The Noticers of the world are rare and beautiful gifts. That's when I finally realized she was a gift to my frenzied soul. My promise to slow down was made almost three years ago, at the same time I began my journey to let go of daily distraction and grasp what matters in life. And living at a slower pace still takes a concerted effort. My younger daughter is my living reminder of why I must keep trying. In fact, the other day, she reminded me once again. The two of us had taken a bike ride to a sno-cone shack while on vacation. After purchasing a cool treat for my daughter, she sat down at a picnic table delightedly admiring the icy tower she held in her hand. Suddenly a look of worry came across her face. \"Do I have to rush, Mama?\" I could have cried. Perhaps the scars of a hurried life don't ever completely disappear, I thought sadly. As my child looked up at me waiting to know if she could take her time, I knew I had a choice. I could sit there in sorrow thinking about the number of times I rushed my child through life... or I could celebrate the fact that today I'm trying to do thing differently. I chose to live in today. \"You don't have to rush. Just take your time,\" I said gently. Her whole face instantly brightened and her shoulders relaxed. And so we sat side-by-side talking about things that ukulele-playing-6-year-olds talk about. There were even moments when we sat in silence just smiling at each other and admiring the sights and sounds around us. I thought my child was going to eat the whole darn thing -- but when she got to the last bite, she held out a spoonful of ice crystals and sweet juice for me. \"I saved the last bite for you, Mama,\" my daughter said proudly. As I let the icy goodness quench my thirst, I realized I just got the deal of a lifetime. I gave my child a little time... and in return, she gave me her last bite and reminded me that things taste sweeter and love comes easier when you stop rushing through life. Whether it's ... Sno-cone eating Flower picking Seatbelt buckling Egg cracking Seashell finding Ladybug watching Sidewalk strolling I will not say, \"We don't have time for this.\" Because that is basically saying, \"We don't have time to live.\" Pausing to delight in the simple joys of everyday life is the only way to truly live. (Trust me, I learned from the world's leading expert on joyful living.)\n",

            "Paragraph: WASHINGTON, Aug 11 - All but one of the 17 Republicans vying for the party's presidential nomination have made the cut so far for the next debates hosted by CNN, the network said on Tuesday in a decision that could leave former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore on the sidelines. CNN and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which is co-hosting the Sept. 16 debates, said invitations have been sent by former first lady Nancy Reagan to 16 candidates who meet their criteria. All but Gilmore \"have qualified thus far and have received invitations,\" they said in a statement. Earlier this year CNN said candidates must meet certain criteria, including an average of 1 percent of support in three recent national polls. CNN's latest poll released showed Gilmore at the bottom of the pack with less than one percent. \"Additional candidates will receive invitations if they meet all of the previously released debate criteria.\" CNN and the library said. Like last week's Republican presidential debates hosted by Fox News, the CNN event will actually be two debates - dividing the crowded Republican field into two groups, with one featuring the top 10 candidates. Although nearly all of the candidates made the cut for the CNN event, it is still unclear how the field will look a month from now when CNN and the library determine how to split the group based on their standing as of Sept. 10. Gilmore, who was governor of Virginia from 1998-2002 and previously made a brief run for the presidency in 2008, also has until then to try to boost his recognition among voters to make the cut. The candidates are vying to be their party's nominee in the presidential election in November 2016.\n",

            "Paragraph: Summit Entertainment When it comes to introverts and extroverts, many see these two personality groups as being polar opposites. Introverts are those who need to recharge after spending time with others and that’s something extroverts just don’t understand, right? Well, according to a new study , that may not be the case. According to The Atlantic , researchers had 48 Finnish university students report their behavior and feelings five times a day. They did this for 12 days via a phone survey and at the end, the participants took a test measuring where they fit on the scale of the Big Five personality traits: neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion. What they found has given new meaning to the introvert/extrovert divide. Universal Pictures / giphy.com The results: Whether they were introverts or extroverts, participants consistently felt the need to recharge after socializing. In other words, when someone took part in extroverted behavior, they ended up feeling happier in the moment, but were ultimately tired three hours later. The same thing happened when the students did things like study or work. Yes, extroverts may be more eager to socialize than introverts, but that doesn’t change the fact that being around others makes them tired. The study explains \"For those who do feel depleted after social interaction ... it may be pleasant to learn that such a reaction is quite normal (and does not imply that one is an introvert or that one is lazy).\" Finishing the Hat / giphy.com Though this is one study, others do point out that extroverted behavior can make many different types of people happy. Plus, whether someone is an introvert or extrovert, they can exhibit different behavior depending on the day, mood, or situation. Ultimately, while it is fun to learn more about our personalities, it’s also important to remember that nothing is set in stone. Each one of us is constantly evolving and, because of this, we shouldn’t feel as though we’re boxed in by labels such as introvert or extrovert.\n",

            "Paragraph: Thursday on Fox News Channel’s \"America’s Newsroom,\" Howard Kurtz, anchor of the network’s \"MediaBuzz\" program took aim at critics in the \"establishment media\" that have bemoaned President Donald Trump’s selection of reporters at press conferences with foreign leaders, which have been mostly members of what they deem to be the conservative media. Kurtz called those critics \"whiny\" when asked by anchor Shannon Bream to react to CNN’s Jim Acosta, who took to the airwaves to criticize Trump for those selections. \"It’s not just Jim Acosta,\" Kurtz replied. \"The establishment media as a whole is engaging in a lot of hand-wringing and hyperventilation over the president’s selection of questioners. And frankly, it’s sounding a little bit whiny. But here are the facts: Eight questions from American reporters at the four news conferences the president has held with foreign leaders. Six of those have come from Fox, Fox Business, The New York Post, Christian Broadcasting, Townhall and The Daily Caller. So this is quite deliberate. He hasn’t called on any of the broadcast networks or major newspapers. Some of the questions have been good and some questions not so good. It was embarrassing on Monday as the controversy swirled about National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, what would he do hours before he was forced to resign, that the questions asked at that news conference did not mention General Flynn.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: 40K Like 4 40K Share share The sciatic nerve is among the biggest in the body, starting at the lower spine, going through the buttocks, and ending down to the lower limb of the foot. Its location makes it responsible for the strength, feeling and movement of legs. Sciatica pain is a common issue, manifested by pain, tingling, weakness, and numbness of the lower limbs, and due to these signs, it may often be mistaken for leg cramps or lower back pain. At times, it may lead to numbness and mild ache, but sometimes it causes almost unbearable, sharp, burning sensation in one side of the body. The resulting discomfort and pain usually force people to stay in bed, and usually, patients use some over-the-counter drugs to relieve its symptoms, such as ibuprofen. Research shows that even 40% of the world’s population will experience this issue at some point in their lives. We will reveal 8 natural ways to alleviate sciatica pain and treat the inflammation. Acupuncture Acupuncture is an alternative treatment, which includes the insertion of hair-fine needles at certain body points, aiming to help the nerve function and boost energy. The relief of this therapy is felt even after the first treatment, but a few sessions can do miracles for the pain. Nowadays, acupuncture is extremely popular, as it has been shown to be effective in the case of migraines, stress, giving up smoking, and also to stimulate the lymph flow. Chiropractic Adjustments Research has shown that chiropractic adjustments can be effective in treating this issue, as the manipulation of the spine can alleviate pain, promote healing, treat inflammation, restore mobility, and enhance function. Ice Packs Ice packs can instantly relieve sciatica. You can also use a simple package of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, and place it directly on the painful area. Leave it for 20 minutes I every 3 hours, and the pain will be completely relieved. Alternate Temperatures Ice packs definitely provide an instant relief, but they cannot do deeper and treat the inflammation, and the sciatic nerve is deep in the body. Therefore, you should apply a hot pack immediately after the ice pack, or you can have a hot bath. The alternation of temperatures will stimulate the circulation and lymph flow, and thus, you will treat the inflammation, and accelerate its healing. For improved results, you can add some essential oils, herbs, or Epsom salts to your bath. Mild (Yoga) Stretches Even though every single movement can be painful, you need to be active in order to accelerate healing. Therefore, you can practice yoga stretches or gentle back stretches. In this way, you will improve mobility, strengthen the muscles on the back, and boost the blood flow. Massage Trigger-point therapies or deeper massaging is extremely effective in treating pain, muscle spasms, and numbness of the toes and legs. Moreover, you will benefit a lot from the use of herb-infused oils and essential oils. Herbs And Oils Numerous natural herbs can provide great effects, as they reduce inflammation and treat pain. These herbs can be used via infused oils, capsules, salves, and liniments. Furthermore, you can use these herbs in tinctures, elixirs, essential oils, and tea from fresh or dried herbs, and alleviate pain. Yet, before you start using natural herbs, consult your doctor, in order to check if they interfere with some medications you take. These are the most helpful herbs you can use in order to reduce inflammation, and pain, and support nerve health: Turmeric or curcumin (mix it with black pepper in order to increase its bioavailability) Roman chamomile Devil’s claw Milky oat tops White willow bark Mullein root Clary Sage Lavender Licorice St. John’s Wort Skullcap Jamaican dogwood Linden flower Kratom Arnica Sleep Make sure you get enough sleep, in order to relax the muscles and the body, and strengthen and rebuild the nerves. Although science has not confirmed these alternative sciatica pain remedies, numerous people have experienced significant relief due to them, and have succeeded to control cramps, spasms, pain and numbness. Yet, in case you experience these symptoms longer that a couple of weeks, you should visit your doctor, as you may have some other condition which pinches the nerves or leads to pressure, such as dislocated vertebrae, and another therapy, or a surgery, may be the solution.\n",

            "Topic: Gitmo Board Approves Release of Al-Qaeda Bomb Maker\n",
            "Paragraph: President Barack Obama’s parole-style board has approved the repatriation of an al-Qaeda-linked Saudi bomb-maker — held at the U.S. military detention center in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — who authorities believe may re-engage in terrorism against the United States. The Gitmo detainee has been identified as Jabran Qahtani, 39. In March 2002, he was detained in Pakistan where he received explosives training from al-Qaeda. By August of that year, he had been transferred to the Guantánamo facility, also known as Gitmo. Qahtani had traveled to Pakistan from his home country to Afghanistan at the beginning of the war in October 2001 with the intention of fighting U.S.-led coalition troops. In its final determination, Obama’s multi-agency Periodic Review Board (PRB) argues that \"the risk the detainee presents can be adequately mitigated by transfer for prosecution and rehabilitation in Saudi Arabia.\" It adds: The Board noted... the detainee’s expressed regret and commitment to not repeat his past mistakes, the detainee’s family commitment to support the detainee upon transfer, and the detainee’s recent positive change in behavior and mindset while detention. The Board acknowledges the detainee’s past terrorist-activities and connections, specifically the detainee’s admission of support for the Taliban, association with two [al-Qaeda] leaders, and his training in building electronic boards. Meanwhile, the PRB declared al-Qaeda-linked Yemeni Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, 47, a \"forever prisoner\" on November 21, the same day that it decided to approve Qahtani for release. Abdullah, also known as Said Salih Said Nashir, traveled to Afghanistan in June 2001 where he trained with al-Qaeda. He was arrested in Pakistan in September 2002 and taken to Gitmo the following month. Some detainees who had been previously designated too dangerous to release — \"forever prisoners\" — have been liberated by the Obama administration. The recent decisions come as outgoing President Obama has stepped up PRB reviews in his quest to keep his campaign promise of shutting down the Guantánamo prison. Abdullah (Nashir) is expected to get another hearing on December 8. A U.S. intelligence profile of Qahtani, dated March 4, notes that he received an electrical engineering degree from King Saud University in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. It adds: He received abbreviated weapons training at an [al-Qaeda] camp in Afghanistan and was selected by a senior [al-Qaeda] military commander to receive explosives detonator training in Faisalabad, Pakistan ... His education and training also make [Qahtani] a skilled bomb maker, however, whose electronics expertise would be in high demand by terrorist organizations. Should [Qahtani] return to Saudi Arabia, we assess that he would seek out prior associates who could provide him a path to reengage in hostilities and extremism, if he chose to do so. Nevertheless, he was approved for repatriation on November 21 by Obama’s board. The PRB points out: In making this determination, the Board considered the detainee’s credible desire to participate in the Saudi rehabilitation program and reintegrate into society, the detainee’s willingness to submit authority of the Saudi Government, the Board’s confidence in the efficacy of the Saudi rehabilitation program, and Saudi Arabia’s ability to implement security assurances after completion of the program. Citing a January 2009 report from the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), the U.S. intelligence profile reveals that the Saudi terrorist expressed his support for the Taliban, al-Qaeda’s ally, early in his detention at Gitmo. He \"repeatedly stated that he intended to rejoin the extremist fight against the US and its allies,\" notes the profile. The Obama administration disclosed the PRB’s dual decision regarding the release of Qahtani and indefinite detention of Abdullah on Tuesday. Currently, 60 captives are being held at Gitmo. Following the recent decision, the number of detainees approved for release by Obama’s board reached 21, and the number of \"forever prisoners\" increased to 29. The remaining 10 Gitmo detainees \"are in war crimes proceedings at military commissions, six of them death-penalty tribunals,\" reports the Miami Herald. U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has to approve security arrangements after providing 30 days notice to Congress for each prisoner that is to be released, which means some of them may not be liberated by President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day on January 20, 2017. Nevertheless, the Miami Herald, citing an unnamed U.S. official with knowledge of the transfer process, reported last month that the Obama administration is currently not providing 30-day transfer notices to Congress as mandated by law. Trump campaigned on a promise to keep Gitmo open and \"load it up with some bad dudes.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Sure, it's enjoyable, but why did it first evolve? MBLifestyle/Shutterstock Considering that it’s happening all the time, everywhere, all across the world, there’s a lot that scientists still don’t know about the female orgasm. Although the debate over the chemistry of female ejaculation has been settled, it’s still not definitively clear how many types of female orgasms there are. The most tantalizing question of all, though, has barely been addressed – namely, what is the evolutionary point of the female orgasm? Writing in the Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution , a team of scientists at Yale University think they’ve come up with an answer. Rather than merely evolving as a trait to accompany the male orgasm, which some presumed was an adaptation to encourage pair-bonding between partners, these researchers have concluded that it was once the key biological trigger required for ovulation to take place. When women orgasm, they release two hormones, oxytocin and prolactin. In the females of wild placental mammals , this type of hormonal discharge actively causes ovulation to begin, and without it, pregnancy would not be possible. The male and female orgasms work together, so to speak, to begin ovulation. It’s likely that the same mechanism initially evolved in human females for precisely the same reason. Over time, women developed the ability to ovulate on cycles independent of male sexual activity. This hormonal function was rendered unnecessary and it became superfluous, but it stuck around in female biology due to its secondary role as a pleasurable bonding mechanism.\n",

            "Paragraph: Millennial men, hang onto your wallets. Phone scams are soaring, and you’re far more likely than any other group to get taken -- and taken big. Roughly 22.1 million Americans lost an estimated $9.5 billion to phone scams last year -- up a whopping 56 percent from 2015, according to a new study sponsored by Truecaller, a spam-fighting phone app. That amounts to nearly one in every 10 American adults. However, men between the ages of 18 and 34 are three-times more likely to be victimized than the overall population, according to Truecaller’s Harris poll of more than 2,000 adults. One-third of millennial males say they’ve lost money in a phone con, according to Truecaller.  Just 11 percent of millennial women lost money in a phone scam. However, both genders become more skeptical as they age. Only 9 percent of the average adult population has lost money in a phone scam. Robocalls aren’t just annoying; they can be the first step in stealing your money. In \"We don’t know why young men are so susceptible,\" said Tom Hsieh, a vice president at Truecaller. \"But one of the important things to understand is that no one is immune.\" Notably, telemarketing scams once mainly targeted landlines, but they’re increasing moving to the mobile world. In the past year, 72 percent of victims said they were contacted by cell. Two years ago, less than half of phone-scam victims were on a mobile line, according to the survey. The average amount lost is also soaring, too. In 2016, it amounted to a $430 vs. $274 in 2015. The scams run the gamut from fraudsters posing as IRS agents to those supposedly raising cash for charities, Hsieh added. By and large, the cons start with some form of robocall, which allows con artists to dial hundreds of numbers at once. Truecaller’s latest survey found 87 percent of American adults said they’ve received at least one robocall call in the past month, and more than half reported that they received more than 10 spam calls a month. More than half --  56 percent -- said they had also received at least one spam text per month, while 23 percent said they received six or more spam texts a month.  Last year, 11 percent of U.S. consumers lost approximately $7.4 billion to phone-related fraud, and there's a new crop of scams this year. Jill S... This research largely mirrors monthly data from YouMail, which also tracks spam calls. YouMail, which provides visual voicemail and spam-blocking services, said received U.S. robocalls rose 11 percent in March to an estimated 2.45 billion. But residents of some cities are far more likely to receive spam calls than others. The YouMail Robocall Index finds the most robocalled cities are Atlanta; Washington, D.C.; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Memphis; New York; Little Rock, Arkansas; Macon, Georgia; New Orleans; Dallas and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Except in Atlanta -- where you get robocalls daily, residents of each of these cities receive an average of one robocall every two days. These calls are more than a nuisance. They’re the entry point for most phone-based scams, experts say. The best way to avoid them is simple -- don’t pick up the phone. Scammers rarely leave a message. You can also install antispam programs, such as those offered by YouMail, TrueCaller, Hiya and Nomorobo. All four services aim to identify incoming calls and hang up on phone numbers that have proven to be used by crooks and spammers.  Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

            "Paragraph: For whatever reason—musical integrity, general disinterest, etc.—the origins of McDonald’s \"I’m Lovin’ It\" jingle have long been a semi-secret. There have been rumblings that Justin Timberlake and Pharrell Williams wrote the second-long earworm, but those were never really confirmed, even though the former sung a longer version of the song on a three-song EP produced by the latter. Now, new information has emerged linking Clipse member, GOOD Music president, and Re-Up Records founder Pusha T to the jingle, at least according to former record executive Steve Stoute. Stoute, who claims to have brokered the deal, dropped the tidbit in an interview with Hot 97’s Ebro Darden, saying, \"That’s crazy that Pusha T wrote the song to McDonald’s ‘I’m Lovin’ It.’ I can’t remember the money [received]. It was 11 years ago. Nobody was upset.\" Indeed it is crazy, especially considering that the rapper has also written numerous odes to cocaine, including a song he dropped alongside Jay Z just last week called \"Drug Dealers Anonymous.\" Those McDonald’s fries are addictive, though. Though Stoute is a pretty solid source on the song’s origins, Pusha T has yet to really confirm the information himself. He did, however, tweet a link to the story alongside a series of emoji: a burger, some french fries, and the cash faced emoji man. \"I’m Lovin’ It\" has been one of McDonald’s most successful and long-running campaigns. It debuted in 2003, and has been translated into a number of different languages for use in dozens of other countries. Pusha T’s latest record is Darkest Before Dawn, though he’s said to have another, King Push, on the way. [via Pitchfork] Submit your Newswire tips here.\n",

            "Paragraph: Um, so, Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. THE AZTECS. 1. Cleopatra lived closer in time to the invention of Snapchat than to the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Cleopatra died a little more than 2,000 years ago in 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed around 2560 BCE. That’s a difference of more than 2,500 years. 2. Also, the Great Pyramid was older to the Romans than the Romans are to us. Even in its earlier years, the Roman Empire was still further removed from the construction of the Great Pyramid than they are from us. 3. Oh, and the Stegosaurus was older to the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T. rex is to us. Not only did they not exist at the same time, but the T. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the Stegosaurus died out. 4. The oldest living person was born closer to the signing of the US Constitution than to today. Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, the oldest living person today at age 117, was born in 1899. That’s 112 years after the signing of the Constitution, which was signed in 1787. 5. The 10th president of the United States has two grandchildren who are alive today. John Tyler had a son, Lyon Tyler, at age 63. Lyon went on to have children late in life as well, including Lyon Tyler Jr. and Harrison Tyler, both of whom are alive today...and are only in their eighties. 6. Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization. Oxford began teaching in some form all the way back in the year 1096. By most accounts, the Aztecs didn’t begin their civilization until the beginning of the 13th century. 7. Harvard University was founded before Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity. While not nearly as old as Oxford, Harvard is still an old university. It was founded in 1636, almost 50 years before Isaac Newton published his Principia Mathematica in 1687, which outlined his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. 8. We made it to the moon only 66 years after the Wright brothers invented human flight. The Wright brothers’ first flight was in 1903, and the Apollo 11 moon landing was in 1969. There’s so much Americans can accomplish when we get in a pissing contest with Russia. 9. Woolly mammoths were still alive when the Great Pyramid at Giza was built. In fact, the pyramid was roughly 1,000 years old when the mammoths went extinct completely, which wasn’t until about 1560 BCE. 10. When the first Star Wars movie came out, France was still executing people by guillotine. The final execution by guillotine in France occurred in 1977, when a man by the name of Hamida Djandoubi was executed for torturing and killing his girlfriend. That was the same year the first Star Wars movie hit theaters. 11. When the fax machine was invented, people were still traveling the Oregon Trail. The first major wagon train hit the Oregon Trail in 1841. Just two years later, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain created a preliminary version of the modern fax machine. 12. The Ottoman Empire still existed when Paramount Studios was founded. The Ottoman Empire was founded around the year 1300, but it lasted all the way until 1922. Paramount was founded 10 years earlier in 1912. 13. Betty White is older than sliced bread. Speaking of 1922, that’s the year Betty White was born. By contrast, the first commercially produced, automatically sliced loaves of bread weren’t made until 1928. 14. Will Smith is now older than James Avery (Uncle Phil) was when Fresh Prince of Bel-Air started. Not sure how it’s even possible, but Will Smith is now 48 years old. James Avery was 45 when Fresh Prince premiered back in 1990. 15. If they made a That ’90s Show and waited the same amount of time after the decade as That ’70s Show waited after the ’70s, the show would be made in 2017. It might seem like That ’70s Show was made way after the end of the ’70s, but that gap is exactly the same as the gap between now and the ’90s. 16. The Eiffel Tower was inaugurated the same year Nintendo was founded. Most people know that the Eiffel Tower was inaugurated for the 1889 World’s Fair. What you might not know is that Nintendo started out as a playing card company, and was founded in the same year. 17. Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., and Barbara Walters were all born in the same year. Though they’re often thought of as having lived in very different times, Anne Frank, Barbara Walters, and MLK Jr. were all born in 1929. 18. Some of the world’s whales that are alive today were born before Moby-Dick was written. Some bowhead whales are believed to have a lifespan of more than 200 years. Since Moby Dick was published in 1851, that means there may be whales out there who are nearly 50 years older than the book. 19. Pluto didn’t even get to complete one orbit around the sun between the time it was discovered and the time it was declassified as a planet. Pluto was discovered thanks to an observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, back in 1930. It was heartbreakingly demoted in 2006. Because of its distance from the sun, Pluto takes 248 Earth-years to orbit the sun just once. That means it didn’t even get halfway around during the time it was being called a planet. 20. 9/11 happened closer to the fall of the Berlin Wall than to today. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, only 12 years before 9/11, the 15th anniversary of which just passed this year. 21. If the history of the universe were placed on a calendar year, humans would only exist starting around 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31. This was famously outlined by Carl Sagan in Cosmos. If you compressed the entire history of everything, going back to the Big Bang, into a calendar year, all of human history would only take up just a little more than the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year. 22. More than 6% of all humans who have ever lived are alive today. Thanks to a boom in population growth following advances in technology and medicine, the current human population living on Earth right now is about 6% of the entire human population in the entire history of the planet. 23. Everything you see happened in the past, not the present. Since it takes about 50 milliseconds for visual information to process in your brain, by the time you actually \"see\" something, it happened in the past.\n",

            "Paragraph: And a child shall build it? A long-discussed footbridge project over a Key West waterway has been resuscitated by unlikely champion: a 10-year-old girl who presented plans to City Commissioners last week for an 85-foot rainbow-colored span that would salute Key West's diversity. \"Key West welcomes many different people,\" Adelle Barsky-Moore of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea told commissioners. \"It has equality for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. The bridge will celebrate diversity with the many colors of the gay pride flag.\" And it could become reality. Barsky-Moore, whose parents are gay, first conceived of the \"Rainbow Pride Bridge\" for a 4th grade class project, spending three weeks building a popsicle-stick model and crafting a presentation, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Her bridge will be \"more fabulous\" than rainbow-colored crosswalks installed in West Hollywood, her PowerPoint presentation promised commissioners. Barsky-Moore calculated the span, built of steel and wood, will cost roughly $132,500 -- but could be partially paid for with funds raised by selling name inscriptions at $100 each. Though she originally designed the bridge for an area just west of Duval Street, commissioners thought it would be perfect over Admiral's Cut as part of a $30 million master plan to develop former Navy property on the waterfront. \"I thought it was a brilliant idea,\" City Commissioner Jimmy Weekley told KeysNet.com. \"I'm going to push this forward and try to get this accomplished.\" Key West first has to come to an agreement with a family who owns the land in question, Weekley said. But not only did Barsky-Moore's presentation win \"initial endorsement\" from the city commission, KeysNews.com reports St. Petersburg architect Andy Hayes, who happened to overhear her proposal, offered to donate design fees if the city moves on the project. There is one drawback, according to the Sun Sentinel: a new popsicle model may be necessary. \"A kid on my bus pretty much broke it,\" Barsky-Moore said.\n",

            "Topic: Tennessee Lawmakers Aim To Punish University For 'Sex Week' By Cutting Back Public Debate\n",
            "Paragraph: A group of conservative Tennessee lawmakers plan to punish the state's flagship public university over a student-organized event in early March called \"Sex Week\" -- by dramatically cutting back its ability to host guest speakers. State lawmakers are moving forward this week with a vote on legislation that would bar the University of Tennessee (UT) and other public institutions of higher education from using institutional revenue to \"engage and pay visiting or guest speakers for events.\" Even commencement speakers who asked the school to cover travel and lodging costs or who sought a speaker fee would be eliminated. (The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.) Another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker. Both of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics. Campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. The legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013. Last week, two other state senators -- Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Government Operations Committee Chairman Mike Bell (R-Riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward Sex Week. Gov. Bill Haslam (R) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law. University leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block Sex Week because the First Amendment protects college students' right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up. Bell and Gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene. But UT system President Joe DiPietro told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that the university did not have \"any indication from anybody that there's an obscenity situation at all in this program.\" Attendance at Sex Week increased this year, according to the school's Daily Beacon. Sex Week organizers told HuffPost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an UT administrator said in February that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni. Nonetheless, the Tennessee state House has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized Sex Week, which the House called \"an atrocious event.\" On Monday, a petition opposing Campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. In addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers Friday. A UT-Knoxville graduate student provided The Huffington Post with a form email she received from Campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. The lawmaker said: While I support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. Sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized. UT administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with Campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard. \"If people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, I think that could have a significant impact,\" UT faculty senate president David Golden told the TV station WATE. \"I can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus.\"\n",

The Mexican singer will officially crossover to the American market on Wednesday night, with the premiere of Fox's competition show, but the star isn’t planning to change a thing. During a recent press call, Rubio said she felt fortunate to represent Latinos on the show and was excited to surprise this new audience with her outspoken and energetic personality. \"When Simon [Cowell] first approached me, I was so excited. I was surprised in the beginning and then I was really, really excited,\" the star told reporters. \"Of course it’s one of the biggest opportunities right now in my career. And I’m just so excited to see how everybody is embracing the news.\" The 42-year-old star has been the reigning \"Queen of Latino Pop\" for over 25 years and she thinks her lengthy career coupled with her fierce attitude is what will surprise \"X Factor\" fans the most. \"They will be surprised that I have been in the music industry for so long... that I’m outspoken and I’m not intimidated by anything, that I am very loyal to my feelings and who I am,\" Rubio said during the press call. The Fox reality show won’t be the Mexican singer’s first time in a judge’s chair. The star has been a coach in \"La Voz Mexico\" and \"La Voz Kids\" -- both Spanish-language versions of \"The Voice\" -- and has learned valuable lessons from those experiences. \"The hardest thing is just to talk with your heart and tell them when they don’t have the talent,\" Rubio said. \"But they are coming for professional advice so I decided to be constructive and positive. I always say the positive first, then the negative.\" Rubio also spoke about the \"love\" and respect she has for her fellow X-Factor judge and new friend Demi Lovato. Yet it was Simon Cowell, the show’s creator and most infamous face, that took the Mexican star by surprise. \"Like everybody else, I saw him on different shows but I was not a fan,\" Rubio told reporters. \"I think I’m a fan right now because he is so straight to the point [and] we have a similar humor, very sarcastic and I just really like his point of view. He’s rude sometimes or straight [to the point] but that’s why everybody likes him.\" During the interview, Rubio also revealed she is recording a new album that will have both English and Spanish tracks. But while the project is in the works, the pop superstar is simply excited to be representing Latinos on the \"The X-Factor.\" \"I’m very honored to represent my people with joy, a lot of happiness and spiciness,\" Rubio told HuffPost. \"The X Factor\" Season 3 returns with a two-night premiere on Wed., Sept. 11 and Thurs., Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.\n",

The Food and Drug Administration has outlawed antibacterial soaps, giving soap manufacturers a year to remove the ingredients from their products, according to The Food and Drug Administration has outlawed antibacterial soaps, giving soap manufacturers a year to remove the ingredients from their products, according to NBC News. The ingredients that comprise \"antibacterial\" products include triclosan and triclocarban, which the FDA has outlawed based on the industry’s failure to prove their effectiveness and safety. \"Companies will no longer be able to market antibacterial washes with these ingredients because manufacturers did not demonstrate that the ingredients are both safe for long-term daily use and more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of certain infections,\" the FDA explained in a statement. Triclosan, in particular, can be found in at least 2,000 different products, including 93 percent of liquid products labeled \"antibacterial\" or \"antimicrobial,\" the FDA found. There’s no proof yet that triclosan is dangerous to people, yet the Obama administration wants soap manufacturers to spend thousands of dollars to reconfigure their products. Can’t people just decide for themselves whether or not they want to use \"antibacterial\" products? Of course, we couldn’t possibly be expected to make good decisions for ourselves. This is the same government that thinks we’re not competent enough to decide for ourselves to purchase health care insurance without assistance from Big Brother. This is just another example of how our federal government bureaucrats have gotten too big for their britches — and the working class are the ones who pay the price of their gross overreach.

            "Paragraph: There was an angry reaction in Afghanistan to news that the first female fixed-wing pilot in the country's air force was requesting asylum in the United States after completing an 18-month training course. The Afghan defense ministry confirmed on Sunday that Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 25, had sought asylum after the Wall Street Journal quoted her as saying that she feared her life would be in danger if she returned home. A recipient of the U.S. State Department's \"Women of Courage\" award in 2015, Capt. Rahmani had been a symbol of efforts to improve the situation of women in her country, more than a decade after the fall of the Taliban regime. Mohammad Radmanish, a defense ministry spokesman, said the government hoped that her request would be denied by U.S. authorities who have spent billions trying to build up Afghan security forces. \"When an officer complains of insecurity and is afraid of security threats, then what should ordinary people do?\" he said. \"She has made an excuse for herself, but we have hundreds of educated women and female civil right activists who work and it is safe for them.\" Capt. Rahmani, who graduated from flight school in 2012 and qualified to fly C-208 military cargo aircraft, had been in the United States on a training course and had been due to return home on Saturday. In a conservative country notorious for the restrictions placed on women, Rahmani's story stood out as a rare example of a woman breaking through in areas normally reserved for men. Her success came at a price, however. The citation for the \"Women of Courage\" award said she and her family had received direct threats not just from the Taliban but also from some relatives, forcing her family to move house several times. However, there was little sympathy on Afghanistan's active social media networks, which were replete with comments criticizing Rahmani, accusing her of wasting government money spent on expensive training and avoiding her responsibilities. \"Niloofar Rahmani took a million dollars from the pockets of the people of Afghanistan to pay human traffickers to get to America to seek asylum,\" one Facebook user wrote in comments typical of others. Dozens of Afghan troops receiving training in the United States have gone missing over the past two years, and at least one has been detained while trying to cross the border to Canada.\n",

These Jackrabbits struggled, but they're back in the NCAA tournament in large part thanks to Daum's 25.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per game -- and the beast-mode 34 and 12 he put on Omaha in SDSU's two-point Summit League championship win. 59. Kent State Golden Flashes The Golden Flashes got here with a conference tourney run of unmatched epicness: A 116-106 overtime win over Central Michigan followed by three wins in three days over its league's top three seeds by an average of 3.3 points -- culminating in a title game win that not only earned them a bid but spoiled rival Akron's 26-win season. MACtion knows no season. 58. Northern Kentucky Norse Not only does Northern Kentucky have one of the best team nicknames under Odin's beard, but its mascot, Victor E. Viking (!), is genuinely terrifying. What more do you need to know? 57. Iona Gaels For the second straight season, Iona's trademark blend of up-tempo offense, long-range shooting and defensive indifference was enough to swipe a bid out from under the two best teams (and benches) in Monmouth Hawks history. 56. Winthrop Eagles Winthrop won at Illinois, held opponents under 47 percent (effective) shooting, and is led by Keon Johnson, a 5-foot-7 senior guard who took 235 3s this season -- and shot 40 percent. If you're looking for a random first-round upset flier, this might be the way to go. 55. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles Since the great Dunk City incursion of 2013 -- a tournament run so memorable Google's first result for \"Dunk City\" is Florida Gulf Coast men's basketball -- former Bill Self assistant Joe Dooley, making FGCU's second-straight tournament appearance, has turned a fun one-off story into a legitimate mid-major program. A smattering of upset culprits hailing from non-power leagues. 54. Bucknell Bison The Patriot League's best team by a wide margin shot 54.6 percent from 2 and 37.7 percent from 3; the Bison were one of the 25-or-so most accurate teams in the country. 53. East Tennessee State Buccaneers The Buccaneers swat a bunch of shots, swipe a mess of steals and turn opponents over on the reg, while lead guard T.J. Cromer capably carries a massive share of the offensive load. If ETSU isn't turning the ball over itself -- and it did so on nearly 21 percent of its possessions this season - it's as dangerous as any mid-major in the field. 52. Vermont Catamounts Vermont went to the brink of disaster in the America East title game: With 17 seconds to play and his team up by three, freshman star Anthony Lamb heaved a head-scratching inbounds pass 60 feet upcourt, giving Albany an unexpected chance to tie. The Great Danes couldn't capitalize. This was just. The 29-5 Catamounts last lost Dec. 21 at Butler. They went unbeaten in their league and won 21 straight -- the nation's longest active streak, and one that might get longer yet. 51. UNC Wilmington Seahawks UNC Wilmington gets buckets. More accurately, UNC Wilmington gets shots. Kevin Keatts' team earned its second straight tourney spot by shooting 56 percent inside the arc while hoisting a healthy diet of 3s, earning second chances at the offensive glass, and turning the ball over fewer times per possession (13.9 percent) than any team in Division I. More shots means more points. Easy to understand, brutal to guard. 50. Princeton Tigers The Ivy League's undefeated regular-season champion and winner of its first-ever conference tournament (which included a stacked-deck overtime semifinal against Penn at the Palestra) is Bo Ryan-era Wisconsin for the elite coastal set. The Tigers do everything well defensively (especially on the glass), slow the pace, and rarely turn the ball over. Meanwhile, no tournament team generated more of its offense (41.7 percent) from beyond the arc. Three is more than two? Pshh. These Ivy League kids think they're so smart. 49. Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders Trigger warning for Michigan State fans: The architects of one of the greatest upsets in NCAA tournament history -- last season's 15-over-2 shocker that sent one of Tom Izzo's best, most harmonious teams home in the first round -- are back. They're also better. Last year's Blue Raiders went temporarily unconscious for one afternoon. The 2017 edition, which generates more of its points from inside the arc (58 percent) than any other team in the field, has been lighting it up for four months. (Mostly) power-conference teams that (probably) won't leave a lasting impression on the field. 48. USC Trojans With all due respect to Andy Enfield's improving program, which is now in its second-straight NCAA tournament, the Trojans barely outscored Pac-12 opposition per possession this season, are liked much less by advanced metrics than the silly old RPI, and have that unmistakable whiff of one-and-out about them. 47. New Mexico State Aggies Marvin Menzies went to five NCAA tournaments in nine years in Las Cruces, N.M., and four in his last five years. His off-the-beaten-path program building landed him the job at UNLV (albeit under unusual circumstances). While Menzies figures out how to make the Runnin' Rebels relevant, the Aggies' succession has proven seamless. 46. Rhode Island Rams Rhode Island entered the season with top-25 expectations, mostly thanks to the return of senior guard E.C. Matthews from 2015's knee injury. Rhody never quite lived up to that billing, but a tourney bid will do. 45. Nevada Wolf Pack Longtime NBA coaching journeyman Eric Musselman may belong to college basketball's increasingly random \"Whoa, that NBA guy coaches there?!\" fraternity -- led by co-presidents Dan Majerle (University of Phoenix) and Mike Dunleavy Sr. (Tulane, seriously) -- but he has done a bang-up job in just his second season at Nevada. The Wolf Pack were the Mountain West's best, and while that may not mean what it did when Jimmer Fredette and Kawhi Leonard were around, it's an impressive accomplishment all the same. 44. Kansas State Wildcats Bruce Weber's team may not be pretty -- which is a polite way of saying it's pretty brutal to watch -- but the Wildcats forced more turnovers than any Big 12 team not nicknamed \"Press Virginia,\" and they beat Baylor twice. So there's that. 43. Vanderbilt Commodores Teams with 14 losses rarely receive at-large bids. No team with 15 losses ever has before. Yet here Vanderbilt is, thanks not only to a comically shallow bubble but, to be fair, to first-year coach Bryce Drew's willingness to embrace the 3-point shot (and why not) as the Commodores' great equalizer. (Oh, and the wins over Florida. Those helped a lot.) 42. Xavier Musketeers Xavier opened the season with top-15 expectations, looked the part for weeks, then lost guard Edmond Sumner to injury and spent February and early March losing to every Big East team not named DePaul. Then came the conference tournament, where the Musketeers redeemed themselves with a win over Butler, and hey: Maybe there's a happy ending to this story yet. 41. Wake Forest Demon Deacons Center John Collins takes 30 percent of Wake Forest's shots, shoots 62 percent from the field, grabs nearly 17 percent of available offensive rebounds, and draws almost eight fouls for every 40 minutes of basketball he plays. Wake's shaky defense nearly kept it out of the field, but lawd is that kid a beast. 40. Providence Friars Ed Cooley's team spent most of the season off the radar, and started Big East play 4-8, before going on a six-game tear to close the regular season. If shots are falling, Providence can play with anybody; if they're not, things can get ugly. 39. Michigan State Spartans Yes, Tom Izzo is Tom Izzo, which is another way of saying this team will probably, somehow, end up in the Elite Eight. Still, chill. Strip away the aura of Marches past (except, you know, last year) and what you're left with is a really young, undeniably talented team that turns the ball over way too much, doesn't force turnovers of its own, doesn't grab offensive rebounds, doesn't get to the line, and commits way too many fouls on the other end. Proceed with caution. 38. Seton Hall Pirates Not unlike conference brethren Providence, Seton Hall started Big East play with three wins in nine games before righting the ship in a 7-2 finish down the stretch. This team rebounds it well on both ends, and Khadeen Carrington, Angel Delgado and Desi Rodriguez can form like Voltron when everything is clicking. Still, the Pirates gave up more than they got per possession in 18 Big East games. Don't go too crazy. 37. Marquette Golden Eagles Anyone up for a fast-paced, high-scoring, defense-optional first-round game? Marquette is the team for you! The Golden Eagles boast one of the nation's most efficient offenses. No team in Division I shoots it better from 3 (43.0 percent). Only Villanova was better in Big East play (and not by all that much). Unfortunately, Marquette also boasts the worst defense of any Big East team not named DePaul. To review: great offense, bad defense, occasionally effective, always fun. 36. VCU Rams Second-year coach Will Wade has VCU in the tournament yet again, with a roster that is yet again forcing a healthy number of turnovers. The defining legacy of Shaka Smart's tenure at the school has now blended into an evolving mix of styles -- including better first-shot and interior defense than at any time in recent program history. 35. Dayton Flyers This is Dayton's fourth straight appearance under coach Archie Miller, which is why you'll hear so much in the next few weeks about the various programs vying for Miller's services. In the meantime, the Flyers -- who record an assist on 61 percent of their made field goals -- will see how far their unselfish, balanced attack will take them. 34. Maryland Terrapins A third season in College Park wasn't Melo Trimble's plan. After a brilliant freshman season, Trimble was a preseason player of the year candidate as a sophomore before a solid but vaguely disappointing season (relative to expectations) -- both for him and for his team -- cooled the NBA's interest. Yet as the only returning starter surrounded by a bevy of promising youngsters, Trimble has once again flashed the ability to carry his team's offense -- sometimes singlehandedly. 33. Arkansas Razorbacks Arkansas drew little national attention this season, and as late as the first week of February, after losses to Missouri and Vanderbilt, the Razorbacks looked like just another mediocre SEC team. By the time the season was over Mike Anderson's team was pushing Kentucky's legion of lottery picks for the title of SEC's best offense. 32. South Carolina Gamecocks Last March's infamous bracket leak overshadowed another minor Selection Sunday disaster: When South Carolina -- one of the first bubble teams left out of the field -- was mistakenly included in a group text congratulating teams for making the NCAA tournament. Whoops! No such clerical issues were in play this year; star wing Sindarius Thornwell and one of the nation's best defenses made sure of that. 31. Virginia Tech Hokies With all due respect to the Hokies' players -- who have fulfilled last year's \"look out for Virginia Tech\" proclamations with Zach LeDay's versatility, brilliant perimeter shooting and plenty of aplomb -- the real star of the show is on the sideline, where coach Buzz Williams has taken up the Gary Williams perspiration torch. Williams starts each game in a three-piece suit; he rarely ends one in it. A few weeks ago, he spent an entire second half in a T-shirt. He's a prop bet waiting to happen. 30. Miami Hurricanes In 2013, after a win that sent Miami to its first Sweet 16 in 13 years, coach Jim Larranaga gave birth to the greatest college hoops gif of the past half decade. In 2015, he whipped and/or nae nae'd. This happened in February. If there's any reason for the uninvested to root for the Hurricanes in March, it's in the hope college basketball's resident adorable grandpa will dance like no one's watching. Living history. 29. Northwestern Wildcats Here are the facts, and boy do they bear repeating: Northwestern's last winning Big Ten record came in 1968. Before 2015-16, Northwestern had never won 20 games in a regular season; it had never broken the 20-win threshold, period. The first NCAA tournament was held in 1939 in Evanston, Illinois. The NCAA tournament has included at least 64 teams for 32 years. Northwestern was the only power conference team in college basketball history -- the only one -- never to make the NCAA tournament. It is almost impossible to fathom the epochal end these 2016-17 Wildcats represent. Compare them to the (World champion!) Chicago Cubs if you like, but then imagine if the Cubs went 100 years without once making the playoffs. That's what we're talking about here. That's how winning 21 games in the regular season, finishing 10-8 in the Big Ten, and sliding into the back half of a 68-team NCAA tournament field makes you legendary. And don't get it twisted: Whatever happens later this week, Chris Collins and his players are already legends. The official category of the pondering emoji, full of flawed teams who might just go to the Final Four anyway. 28. Minnesota Golden Gophers As jaw-dropping as Northwestern's presence in this field is, Minnesota sure gave its league foes a real run for plot-twist primacy. The Golden Gophers won eight games last season. Eight! Richard Pitino suspended or dismissed five players; the athletic director who hired him, Norwood Teague, resigned in disgrace the previous summer; a school audit in May found he had drastically overspent his travel budget in his first two seasons. The idea of Minnesota anywhere near the NCAA tournament was laughable. No one's laughing now. 27. Creighton Bluejays The last time Creighton went to the tournament, coach Greg McDermott's son Doug was getting buckets and winning player of the year awards. For a while there, this team looked even better. An 18-1 start was the best in program history, and folks in Omaha, Nebraska, were talking Final Four. That dream ended alongside point guard Maurice Watson's season, but Marcus Foster and breakout NBA prospect Justin Patton remain a potent offensive brew. 26. Wisconsin Badgers Wisconsin spent the first three months of the 2016-17 season as a top-10 team and presumptive Big Ten favorite; the Badgers have spent the past five weeks trying to figure out why the ball won't go in the basket. The Badgers shot 46.9 percent from 2, 34 percent from 3 and 62 percent from the free throw line in 18 Big Ten games. If, mercifully, those shots start falling, Ethan Happ, Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig will seem dangerously underseeded. If not, the postseason could be brief. 25. Michigan Wolverines Michigan's postseason took one of the scariest turns in recent college hoops memory before it even began. On March 8, departing for the Big Ten tournament in Washington D.C., the Wolverines' team plane aborted takeoff amid high winds, at which point it skidded off the runway into the airport equivalent of a roadside ditch. When the dust had settled and everyone had recovered, John Beilein called a team meeting and asked his players whether they still wanted to go to D.C. People would have understood, you know? Instead Michigan showed up at the Verizon Center the following morning and, clad in practice uniforms, promptly smacked Illinois by 20. Does it get more hard-core? 24. Iowa State Cyclones Monte Morris has spent his entire career in Ames, Iowa, defying the ballhandling odds, but his senior season has been special, even by his own lofty standards. Since 1996-97, no one's averaged 35 minutes, 5.0 assists and 1.0 turnovers in a season; against Big 12 competition, Morris averaged a mistake once every 47 minutes he was on the floor. When coaches dream, they dream of having a point guard like Morris. When they wake up, they have to figure out how to stop the offense he powers. Few manage. 23. Saint Mary's Gaels By most reasonable measures, the 2016-17 Gaels were good enough to be the West Coast Conference's best team in just about any other year in recorded human history. This is probably the best Saint Mary's team ever. This season, unfortunately, Gonzaga happened to be a juggernaut. Tough break. The good news: Now we get to see how uber-efficient center Jock Landale and his hot-shooting Australian brethren stack up with the rest of country. Finally. 22. Notre Dame Fighting Irish Once besmirched in the same breath as Wisconsin and Virginia for its sloth -- and, to be fair, Notre Dame did have a whole offense, \"burn,\" designed around killing clock -- the Irish are now a testament to basketball's modern positional revolution. Notre Dame's center, Bonzie Colson, is a 6-foot-5 converted former wing who's having an All-American season at the fulcrum of a precisely spaced outside-in offensive attack. It's as beautiful as it is effective. 21. Florida Gators Save a season here and a season there, Florida basketball was basically nonexistent until 1996, when Gators athletic director Jeremy Foley hired a 30-year-old Rick Pitino protege named Billy Donovan. In 2015, after two unprecedented decades of success, Foley's task -- finding Donovan's replacement -- was twice as daunting. He chose Mike White. Two-for-two. An injury to top shot-blocker John Egbunu and back-to-back March losses to Vanderbilt have taken some of the shine off what once was one of the nation's hottest teams, but if these suddenly reborn, post-Billy D Gators are locked in, look out. 20. Cincinnati Bearcats Mick Cronin has exclusively fielded athletic, physical, defense-driven teams during his tenure at Cincinnati. None have worn it better than this one. The Bearcats are customarily rowdy on the offensive glass, but they truly thrive at forcing misses inside the arc on the defensive end, which they do better than every team in the country that (a) isn't Gonzaga or (b) doesn't have a 7-foot-6 center (Tacko Fall, UCF). 19. SMU Mustangs In the first season of the post-Larry Brown era (which went exactly as expected, for better and for worse), here's what you need to know about SMU: (1) Semi Ojeleye, a former blue-chip Duke recruit, is 6-foot-7, shoots 43 percent from 3, and is one of the most efficient volume scorers in college hoops; (2) Shake Milton is really good at basketball, but also his name is Shake Milton, so the previous phrase is redundant; (3) Tim Janovich's Mustangs shoot the lights out, rebound their own misses, don't send opponents to the free throw line, and do pretty much everything else you can do while on a basketball court either well or very well. Relative to seed, no team this side of Wichita State will scare its bracket neighbors so comprehensively. 18. Oklahoma State Cowboys Oklahoma State started Big 12 play 0-6. First-year coach Brad Underwood, whom you may remember from such films as \"The Guy Who Coached That Awesome Dude With The Beard That Beat No. 3-Seed West Virginia Last Year,\" pulled things back on defense -- which had given up 1.19 points per trip in those six losses attempting to play Underwood's high-impact Stephen F. Austin style -- and subsequently soaked up wins in 10 of the Cowboys' next 11 games. Along the way, Jawun Evans (perhaps the nation's best passer) and chums usurped UCLA in two ways: They became the nation's most efficient offensive team, per KenPom.com, and the one most likely to draw the old \"but what about stops?!\" bracket skepticism. UCLA's defense isn't all that bad. OSU's defense is still pretty rough. Fair enough. But when you score it like this -- and Underwood's team still gave up 1.06 points per trip (!) in that 10-1 streak down the stretch -- who cares? 17. Butler Bulldogs Remember when Butler was a cute, cuddly Horizon League underdog? Remember how it almost shocked the world? Feels like a long time ago, huh? While Brad Stevens and Gordon Hayward were busy tearing up their respective corners of the NBA, Chris Holtmann, now three-for-three on NCAA bids in his tenure, has carried a program best known for its storybook qualities into a future of perennial Big East contention. 16. Florida State Seminoles Despite all visual evidence to the contrary, Leonard Hamilton is 68 years old. (No, seriously!) This is his 30th college season. This might be his best team ever. It's undoubtedly the best he has had in a decade and a half at Florida State -- most of the time, anyway. Dwayne Bacon, Terance Mann, Xavier Rathan-Mayes and impossibly long wunderkind Jonathan Isaac form one of the most talented, athletic cores in the sport. When they're flying up and down the floor, seizing mismatches and attacking the rim, as they were for most of the 2016-17 season, they're one of the best teams in the country. But when they're bad, they're really bad. 15. Virginia Cavaliers At the dawn of coach Tony Bennett's ascension, Virginia's somnolent pace confused critics into thinking the Cavaliers couldn't score. They could, and quite well, thank you very much -- they just attempted to do so less often than most teams in the matter of 40 minutes. This season's Cavaliers, though, deserve the eyesore rap. The pack-line defense is still the nation's best on a per-possession basis, but against ACC opponents the Cavaliers ranked 11th in points per trip. In late February, they scored 89 points in 120 possessions in two games *combined*. As much as Bennett misses All-American guard Malcolm Brogdon, he might pine for classmate Anthony Gill even more -- the Cavaliers have no post threat, no offensive rebounding and are left prostrate before the fickle whims of whatever cruel Greek deity controls the tightness of orange-painted steel cylinders. The results can be tragic. 14. Purdue Boilermakers Sure, Purdue has its flaws. The Boilermakers finished near the bottom of the Big Ten in offensive rebounding percentage. Their propensity for turnovers -- the Achilles' heel that Arkansas Little Rock exploited in 2016's double-overtime first-round upset -- remains. Their conservative defensive philosophy sacrifices turnovers in order to avoid fouls, which in certain matchups (like Michigan, who beat the Boilers twice in their last four games, comfortable. Purdue also has one of the best long-range rosters in the country surrounding All-American Caleb Swanigan (18.7 points, 12.6 rebounds), who posted 26 double-doubles in 32 games, and who shoots 43 percent from 3 himself. It evens out. 13. Wichita State Shockers Can we be real a second? For just a millisecond? Let down our guard and tell the people how we feel a second? This was written before the bracket was announced. Gasp! We denizens of the past don't yet know where Wichita State was seeded, who they play in the first round, or who was placed in their region. But we can already say these things with confidence: The Shockers are better than their resume, better than their seed, and a waking terror foisted upon whichever No. 1 or No. 2 was unfortunate enough to draw Wichita in a potential second round matchup. Landry Shamet and Conner Frankamp are two of the nation's best 3-point shooters sharing the same backcourt. Wing Markis McDuffie does basically everything well. Only Marquette and Kennesaw State shot it better from deep. Gregg Marshall's teams always guard like crazy. This one is really good. Yet the reasons the Shockers have been inevitably undervalued are not without merit: Every time the MVC champs played three obvious tournament teams (Louisville, Michigan State, Oklahoma State), they lost. Everything is on the table. All contenders are equal, but some are more equal than others. 12. Oregon Ducks With the obvious exception of Michigan (which was literally told to take cover as its airplane skidded off the runway last Wednesday, a tough act to top) no team heard worse news last week than Oregon. Late Friday night, doctors informed Dana Altman that senior forward Chris Boucher had torn his ACL. It was a devastating turn for the sport's most unlikely success story. It also posed new questions about Oregon. No team blocked a higher percentage (17.7) of opponents' attempts this season; the lynchpin in that effort was gone. Could Jordan Bell, already the team's best all-around defender, somehow summon more? Could spot reserve Kavell Bigby-Williams (or, as Bill Walton calls him, \"Bigby\") step in? Meanwhile, the 6-foot-10 Boucher had attempted 101 3s this season, just seven fewer than star guard Dillon Brooks. How would the Ducks' spacing change? How different would its offense look? One game against Arizona in the Pac-12 title isn't enough to know the answers to these questions. We'll find out in the tournament -- and so, it seems, will Oregon. 11. Louisville Cardinals Quiz time. Quick: When did Louisville last fail to show up for the Sweet 16? (No, last season's postseason ban doesn't count.) Ding, ding, ding: 2010. This, not coincidentally, was the last time Rick Pitino didn't preside over one of the nation's most soul-crushing defenses. The Cardinals ranked in the top five in adjusted defensive efficiency every season from 2011 to 2016. They won 17 games in five NCAA tournaments (plus, you know, a national title) in that span. What of these Cardinals, then? Louisville ranks No. 6 defensively per KenPom.com -- all good, right? Look closer: Since Feb. 1, Pitino's team has allowed 1.08 points per trip. Virginia Tech scored 90 in the Yum! Center in mid-February; Wake Forest 88 on the Cards on March 1. Donovan Mitchell is a brilliant high-volume scorer. Pitino is a peerless tactician. But if the Cardinals can't correct this uncharacteristic generosity, and fast, the Sweet 16 might be their ceiling. 10. Baylor Bears Baylor was unranked in the preseason. No, wait -- it gets worse. Not only were the Bears unranked, the AP poll voters didn't pull a single lever in their favor. Not one! Before long, Baylor would reveal itself not just as a top-25 team but one of the sport's best, led by one of its premier two-way players (forward/wing/extraterrestrial Johnathan Motley and powered by one of the stingiest first-shot defenses the Big 12 has seen in years. It seems laughable to think there was a time when Indiana, Connecticut, Syracuse, Texas and Rhode Island were considered better teams than Baylor, but hey, doctors used to swear by bloodletting. Enlightenment's hard. 9. West Virginia Mountaineers You don't need the long version anymore -- how Bob Huggins, after two down years, looked at his undersized roster and decided to make a drastic change. By now, Press Virginia isn't a novelty; it's who the Mountaineers are. And none of Huggins' post-remake teams has been quite as Press Virginia as this one. Not only do Jevon Carter & Co. force more turnovers per possession than any team in college hoops, they force more than any power-conference team in the past 15 years. ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) has been fawning over Huggins' team all season; KenPom.com's adjusted efficiency rankings shares the admiration. You already know West Virginia is good. The Mountaineers are still better than you think. 8. Arizona Wildcats Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey once forbade his front office from likening prospects to NBA players of the same race. Great idea. Comparing players superficially is incredibly pervasive; it is lazy (at best) and misleading (at worst). So instead of saying that Lauri Markkanen -- Arizona's 7-foot European super-frosh who shoots 73 percent at the rim, leads his team in 3-point attempts and accuracy (43.4 percent), and mixes in the occasional unguardable wrong-foot pull-up -- reminds us a lot of Dirk Nowitzki, let's just say Markkanen is the closest thing college basketball has to That Dude. Said dude carried Arizona's offense for months before Wildcats coach Sean Miller got sophomore guard Allonzo Trier back from a PED-related suspension. Now full strength, the Wildcats are a full-blown offensive terror. 7. UCLA Bruins Just now tuning into college basketball? First of all, shame on you. Just kidding. It's totally cool. That said, you did kind of miss out: The 2016-17 UCLA Bruins were one of the most enjoyable nightly experiences this sport has offered up in years. Freshman guard Lonzo Ball -- yes, the kid whose dad (sigh) said he was better than Stephen Curry, and thus set him up for at least one Curry-administered ankle explosion when Ball gets to the NBA next season -- was even better than advertised. Beyond his shooting 72 percent from 2 (!!!) and 41 percent from 3, Ball's passing feel is once-in-a-decade-level stuff. The lights-out group around him (Bryce Alford, Isaac Hamilton, T.J. Leaf, Aaron Holiday, Thomas Welsh) flows in smooth, kinetic unison. The results are regularly spectacular. 6. Duke Blue Devils In 2004, Mike Krzyzewski was offered a five-year, $40 million contract to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. Resisting the NBA sirens proved sage; he has since become the winningest man in Division I hoops history, added two national titles to his total (five), and is likely to be remembered as the greatest college basketball coach of all time. Besides, who needs all that drama ... oh. Real talk: Duke's 2016-17 season has been nothing if not dramatic, to a level that the early-aughts Kobe-Shaq-Phil triumvirate would be proud of. The preseason expectations were imperious. The injuries were debilitating. The Grayson Allen Saga (formal title) was humiliating. Even K himself missed games to undergo and recover from a back surgery. Now, suddenly, they're back in the title conversation. Duke won four straight games and the ACC tournament title in Brooklyn this weekend, knocking off Louisville, North Carolina and Notre Dame along the way. Suddenly, all of the promise of the preseason -- a realized Jayson Tatum, an unguardable Allen-Luke Kennard backcourt combo, interior defense and rebounding that had been missing all year -- came rushing to the fore. But it was also four days. For months, Duke has been \"turning\" various \"corners.\" Do you trust them now? This season's most likely national champions. Emphasis on \"most likely.\" 5. Kentucky Wildcats In many ways, this Kentucky team is like any other John Calipari-era Kentucky team: The Wildcats are one of the youngest, least experienced teams in the country. They're also one of the best. Precocious star freshmen (De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk, Bam Adebayo) mixed with a holdover sophomore (Isaiah Briscoe), stalwart role-guy vets (Derek Willis, Dominque Hawkins), championship-level defense, championship aspirations. The template. The works. Same as ever. Not quite. This team is unlike any of recent Calipari vintage in one critical sense: It's so bleeping fast. From 2011 to 2016, the Wildcats ranked between 147th and 271st in adjusted tempo (per KenPom.com). This team ranks 16th. The Wildcats average 1.14 points per trip in transition (per Synergy scouting data) -- and they get into transition a lot. This -- not defense -- is best reason to expect these Wildcats to show up in Phoenix in three weeks' time. Kentucky is always young and always good. Rarely is it this much fun. 4. North Carolina Tar Heels Every superhero needs his theme music, and every legendary shot needs its Craig Ehlo: devastated, in disbelief, casting the triumph and joy at the center of the frame into the sharpest possible relief. A year ago, North Carolina was that Ehlo. The Tar Heels suffered one of the toughest losses in college basketball history last March, then waved farewell to heart-and-soul seniors Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson. One year season later, Justin Jackson morphed into the ACC player of the year, Joel Berry admirably stepped in to Paige's shoes, and Kennedy Meeks was the tip of a front line spear that rebounded its misses more often -- and generated more shots -- than any team in college basketball. North Carolina could have faded away. It hasn't lost a step. 3. Kansas Jayhawks Kansas won its 13th-straight Big 12 title this year. If you're of those \"but how many NATIONAL titles have they won, hmmm??\" people, may Bill Self have mercy on your soul. In men's hoops history only the late-1960s/1970s-era UCLA Bruins managed as many consecutive conference crowns, and they did so in a much different, less diffuse, less talent-rich era. (Fun fact: John Wooden wasn't even the coach for all 13. If you're wondering why Bill Self was nominated to the Basketball Hall of Fame this year, well, there you go.) The point is: No matter what happens now, Kansas has accomplished something that even the eventual national champion won't ever come close to matching. It's insane. Frank Mason, Josh Jackson, and the rest of KU's cardiac coterie won't be happy with this season unless it ends with a win. But their achievements to date already occupy such high ground that even a force as powerful as the NCAA tournament won't wash them away. 2. Gonzaga Bulldogs Duke's four-wins-in-four-days Barclays Center bum-rush unleashed a deluge of takes about why the Blue Devils deserved a No. 1 seed. More often than not, that No. 1 seed was Gonzaga's. Really? Going 32-1, beating Arizona, Florida and Iowa State on neutral floors, and punishing a really good Saint Mary's team on three separate occasions (plus, you know, losing once in 33 games) wasn't impressive enough for you? Are you not entertained?! Doubts about Gonzaga in March are one of college basketball's most mystifying memes. Doubts about this Gonzaga team -- which starts multiple high-major recruits, features an All-America point guard in Nigel Williams-Goss and arguably the nation's best center in Przemek Karnowski, brings a first-round draft pick (Zach Collins) off the bench, and plays the best defense of Mark Few's career -- won't suddenly vanish after the first weekend. But if you don't think this team is good enough to win a national title, you just haven't been paying attention. 1. Villanova Wildcats Kris Jenkins is still here, still cranking 3s. Jalen Brunson transformed from a wide-eyed freshman to incredibly canny sophomore in less than a calendar year. Josh Hart, the most anonymous top player on any national title team ever, went from a selective cog to the most important, most efficient player in college basketball. Parts remain. The whole has changed. These Wildcats don't guard quite as well. They don't have a senior point guard like Ryan Arcidiacono, or the post-up fallback plan like Daniel Ochefu. This Villanova team is basketball's future made real: Four guards, sometimes five, moving and swinging and shot-faking and firing and playing every bit as well as the team that triumphed in the greatest national title game of all-time. Before that game, before the world learned how wrong its definition of Villanova had been, we might have asked: Can this type of team win it all? Now we already know the answer.\n",

            "Paragraph: Flickr Creative Commons / www.flickr.com If you thought the days of getting kicked out of class for wearing a skirt shorter than the length of your fingertips were over—think again. Girls all over the country get \"dress-coded\" every day for wearing tank tops or shorts deemed too short by teachers and school administrators. Why? Because showing all that skin is \"distracting\" for boys. *Insert dramatic eye roll here* That’s why Portland, Oregon middle schooler Sophia Carlson took a stand last year and challenged her school’s dress code policy. She and her friends, who attended Irvington School, had been kept out of class for dress code violations one too many times. \"It’s a very embarrassing and shaming moment, to get dress-coded,\" said Carlson, now 14, in an interview with Bitch. \"The loss of educational time disproportionately targets girls.\" Carlson and other advocates proposed changes to the district’s dress code that would make it less restrictive overall and, more importantly, gender-neutral. They suggested, for example, removing phrases like \"sexually suggestive\" and ending bans on tops with spaghetti straps, which affected girls far more often than boys. They suggested, for example, removing phrases like \"sexually suggestive\" and ending bans on tops with spaghetti straps, which affected girls far more often than boys. Last week, the Portland Public Schools board ruled in their favor—and the high school experience will never be the same. Finally, kids in Portland will be able to wear clothing that fits their style—and the weather—without getting reprimanded or kicked out of class. The new dress code requires students to wear tops that cover the front and sides of the body—including opaque fabric over the breasts—and bottoms that cover the genitalia, buttocks and undergarments, excluding waistbands. They’re still banned from wearing clothing that depicts: hate speech; drugs, alcohol, marijuana or other controlled substances; pornography, nudity or sexual acts; and gang identifiers. Did you ever get dress-coded in school? What were you wearing?\n",

            "Paragraph: Answer by Alexandra Damsker on Quora . I don't have a multi-million dollar company (yet), but I'm one of those CEOs who function on 3-5 hours of sleep. No, there aren't any drugs involved, nor is there poor management (as far as I know). It's a variety of things. First, reduce TV. You sleep much better, and do much more work, when you don't watch much TV. Your brain is actually less active watching TV than when it's sleeping. This dullness is addictive. My daughter becomes a giant mess when she watches too much TV — huge tantrums, crying, screaming, complete meltdown. She doesn't want to eat or listen. It's like she's addicted, and I'm taking away her drug. My husband is very similar, without the actual crying. He just sort of grunts more. I'm not certain it happens with everyone, but I'd be surprised if most people aren't highly susceptible to this \"one more show\" mentality, and the gape-mouthed stare is the death knell for good work, good eating, good sleep or good play. Second, limit carbohydrates. For me, anyway — they just make me sleepy. Third, limit meetings. Same as carbs. Blah blah blah — hate just droning on, or being droned at. Nothing good comes of this. Fourth, I actually have specific hours I need to sleep to do well, not a specific number of hours. It's a quirk of my circadian rhythm, and it's been that way since my 20s. If I can sleep from 4 to 8am, I'm very happy. However, my home life doesn't permit that, so I usually end up sleeping from 1-4am, and 5-6:30am. I have a hard time sleeping in the early morning hours, and love the morning (once I drag myself out of bed). Fifth, when I get a few energy slumps, I rely on some tried and true solutions: I switch tasks to things I really like (so I save that stuff for sleepy times). I hang out on Quora (dangerous, because I'm on here WAY longer than I should be. There should be a stopwatch or a clock on this thing...!) I go outside. I email or chat with someone personal (not usually on the phone—hate the phone.) I play a set number of solitaire hands. I read the news or, if read, one of three gossip sites I frequent (I'm not proud.) Or, if all else fails, I take a nap. I usually sleep more on slower days or if nothing is happening on a weekend, but it works out. Quiz : 5 Must-Haves Before You Head to College Sixth, and most important, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVE WHAT I DO. I love it so much! I am so incredibly happy that I get to do my job. I have days that suck. I have strings of days that suck. But they are just sucky days — my life is still pretty spectacularly awesome. It makes me excited to wake up, to take the conference call I had today set at the incredibly ludicrous time of 6:30am, to take calls and go to meetings while visiting family, to get over shyness and speak to the stranger next to me on the airplane, to spend the evening playing with my daughter knowing that I'll be working on a document until 4 am and begging Kinko's for something (and I HATE begging.) I mostly just think I am a very lucky person. I have a (pretty) supportive spouse, a fantastic kid, a wonderful dog. I'm healthy, I'm privileged to run a company that is about to split into 2, with customers that are acolytes that spare me marketing dollars. People believe in me and my ability to lead, they believe in what I've created. I do something that I think makes a difference in the world. And today I'm having a pretty good hair day. I don't really worry about the sleep that I get. I get what I can, and do what I have to do every day. Everyone around me is trying to help me out (for the most part), I keep my priorities in order (my kid never suffers, I can't make myself sick), and I just focus on what I have immediately ahead and in the near future, and what I need to get those done. I truly believe it will all benefit everyone in the end, and my support group does, too. And that's how I do it.

According to the According to the BBC , quite simply, doping is the act of an athlete taking a banned or illegal substance in order to improve performance . Apparently, there are five classes of banned substances, but the most commonly used banned substances are anabolic steroids, which work to increase testosterone.

            "Paragraph: Photo: Mark Wilson/2010 Getty Images As the matchup between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton takes shape, it has begun to dawn on some conservatives that the Republican Party faces a distinct handicap: The Democrats will have two popular ex-presidents to campaign for them, and the GOP will have none. Bill Clinton is the party’s most effective surrogate for wife Hillary, writes Byron York in the conservative Washington Examiner: \"Republicans haven’t had the same luck. The only two-term GOP president in the last generation, George W. Bush, has stayed mostly out of politics in the seven years since he left the White House.\" Meanwhile, writing for The Wall Street Journal opinion page, Richard Benedetto grapples with President Obama’s value as a surrogate. \"When Mr. Obama ran for office in 2008, a central part of his campaign strategy was to heap blame on George W. Bush,\" writes Benedetto. \"How has Mr. Obama dodged similar treatment?\" How indeed? The answer, I’d suggest, is something along the lines of by governing competently rather than presiding over a flaming wreck of a presidency. But this answer presumes a level of introspection into the success of the last two Democratic presidents, and the conspicuous failure of the one wedged between them, that is absent from both columns, and from conservative thought in general. York notes \"the GOP’s ex-president situation is a mess,\" a situation he casually describes as \"luck.\" The closest his column comes to exploring the source of this misfortune is to note the bad blood between Donald Trump and the Bush family, especially Trump’s statement that Bush peddled false intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. (\"Jeb Bush stood haplessly by, unable to defend either himself or his brother.\") Of course, Jeb could not defend his brother because, while Trump’s indictment was exaggerated (the Bush administration was victimized by bad intelligence), it was not entirely false (the administration also manipulated the intelligence at its disposal). Benedetto tries to solve the mystery as to why Americans loathed Bush while liking Obama. He does not consider the hypothesis that the comparative performance of the two administrations in domestic and foreign policy may account for this disparity. Instead, Benedetto fixates on the role of Obama’s media manipulation, especially his skillful use of flattering images: He heads a savvy public-relations machine that markets him like a Hollywood celebrity, a role he obligingly and successfully plays. One of the machine’s key tactics is to place Mr. Obama in as many positive news and photo situations as possible. Ronald Reagan’s advisers were considered masters of putting their man in the best possible light, but they look like amateurs compared with the Obama operation—which has the added advantage of a particularly obliging news media. If only Bush’s media handlers had thought to try that! Oh, wait: The news media did in fact transmit the Bush administration’s images of the president swaggering on the deck of the aircraft carrier, and clearing brush on his ranch in a cowboy hat, and standing on the rubble of the building that was destroyed by terrorists after his administration neglected repeated, urgent warnings of a planned attack. Many of these images were fawned over at the time, even by the mainstream media. Chris Matthews slathered over Bush’s \"Mission Accomplished\" coup. The trouble is that it eventually became clear the mission was not accomplished at all. Jimmy Carter’s failed presidency became the Republican Party’s favorite point of comparison for every Democratic candidate or plan well into the 1990s, and they even hauled out the ghost of Carter in 2008 to taint Obama. Carter was a pretty lousy president, though he also suffered from unfortunate macroeconomic timing. Beginning in the 1980s, Republican messaging relied heavily on the connection between the president’s agenda and the economy’s performance. This formula has worked out badly for the last quarter-century, as George H.W. Bush and then his son presided over recessions, and Clinton and then Obama presided over expansions. And yes, long-term trends like negative partisanship have created a situation where most people feel frustrated with politics because they believe their side is losing. Nonetheless, Obama is and has consistently been far, far more popular than any of the leading Republicans. Even if we discount the role of economics completely, though, the difference in governing quality is stark. Democrats have a governing program and a cadre of policy advisers that is responsive to empirical reality and able to effectively respond to real-world problems. Republicans have none of these things, and the rise of Trump has shown that the problem has grown worse, not better. Republicans don’t have an \"ex-president problem.\" They have a failed party.\n",

            "Paragraph: In 2008, on a dig in the First Nation’s Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, archaeologists made a small but stunning discovery: a very tiny clay pot. Though it might not have seemed very impressive at first glimpse, this little piece of pottery was determined to be about 800 years old. And inside that pot? Something that changes how we’re looking at extinction, preservation, and food storage, as well as how humans have influenced the planet in their time on it. It’s amazing to think that a little clay pot buried in the ground 800 years ago would still be relevant today, but it’s true! It’s actually brought an extinct species of squash that was presumed to be lost forever. Thank our Indigenous Ancestors! Even they knew what preservation meant. They knew the importance of the future, Is it not amazing that they are affecting our walks of life even to this day? Here it is! The pot was unearthed on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, where it had laid buried for the past 800 years. Inside, archaeologists found a stash of seeds. The seeds were probably buried in the pot as a method of storing food supplies. They were determined to be an old, now-extinct species of squash. Now, seven years after making this stunning discovery, students in Winnipeg decided to plant the 800-year-old seeds... To everyone's amazement, something grew! The squash was named Gete-okosomin. It means \"Cool Old Squash\" in the Menominee language. (Respect to the Science people for respecting the Indigenous people who's land this was found on, We See Your Good Nature!) Now, they're working to cultivate the squash so that it doesn't go extinct ..again. It may be just a humble squash, but it's also a symbol of First Nations' community and history, as well as a fascinating look into how amazing plants can be. It just goes to show you that plants can be pretty incredible.. and that sometimes, history has a funny way of coming back around. The Wheel of Life really stands out in this instance of history. Our Indigenous roots are strong and very much tied to the land. I was taught once that the people of Turtle Island were keepers of the land, not owners. I feel like this Squash is proof of that teaching.\n",

            "Paragraph: HANOI, Vietnam — Four prison guards in northern Vietnam have been suspended for alleged negligence after a female inmate, on death row for drug trafficking, became pregnant, which means her death sentence will be commuted to life in prison once her child is born, state media reported Tuesday. The Thanh Nien newspaper said Nguyen Thi Hue, 42, was arrested in 2012 for drug trafficking and sentenced to death in 2014. A court rejected her appeal the same year. The paper reported that while in prison, Hue paid a male inmate $2,300 to help her get pregnant. It said the 27-year-old male inmate twice put his sperm in a plastic bag with a syringe in a mutually agreed place and Hue inseminated herself. She became pregnant and is expected to give birth in about two months. Under Vietnamese law, Hue will have her death sentence commuted to life imprisonment for having a child under 3 years of age. Police in Quang Ninh province were not available for comment Tuesday. In 2007, two prison guards in the northern province of Hoa Binh were sentenced to up to five years in prison for abuse of power for allowing a female inmate to get pregnant with a male inmate.\n",

            "Paragraph: Changing hospital lighting so that it follows a natural light-dark cycle could help patients sleep better and experience less pain, a small new study suggests. Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic found that the lack of fluctuation between low light and bright light -- like a typical sleep-wake cycle, where it's bright during the day and dark in the night -- in hospitals is linked with poor sleep, more fatigue and more pain among patients. For the study, published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, researchers examined the light exposure and sleeping patterns of 23 women and 17 men who were admitted to a hospital between May 2011 and April 2012. Researchers followed the light exposure, mood and pain levels of the patients for 72 hours each. Patients in general got fragmented sleep, and just 236.35 minutes (about four hours) of shuteye, on average, each night. An association was found between fatigue and bad mood and low light exposure, while pain levels were linked with fatigue. Meanwhile, \"higher light exposure was associated with less fatigue and lower total mood disturbance in participants with pain, suggesting the need for further investigation to determine if manipulating light exposure for medical inpatients would be beneficial in affecting sleep–wake disturbances, mood and pain,\" the researchers wrote in the study. Study researcher Esther Bernhofer, Ph.D., RN, of the Cleveland Clinic, said in a statement that future studies are needed to \"determine if lighting interventions could offer unique, cost-effective ways to more effectively address the problems of sleep-wake disturbances, distressed mood, and pain in hospitalized patients, providing for overall better patient outcomes.\" It's not just hospital patients whose sleep is being hurt by light -- a recent perspective in the journal Nature pointed out that electric lighting could negatively affect sleep of the population at large.\n",

            "Paragraph: Companies are increasingly betting on the idea that having the boss’s help with student loan payments will be big business. CommonBond, a startup known for student loan refinancing, will now offer a platform employers can use to make contributions to their workers’ student loan payments, the company announced Tuesday. The move was made possible in large part by CommonBond’s acquisition of Gradible, a company that allows borrowers to compare student loan repayment options. With the new technology, CommonBond will become part of a growing cottage industry of startups billing themselves as middle men for companies who CommonBond, a startup known for student loan refinancing, will now offer a platform employers can use to make contributions to their workers’ student loan payments, the company announced Tuesday. The move was made possible in large part by CommonBond’s acquisition of Gradible, a company that allows borrowers to compare student loan repayment options. With the new technology, CommonBond will become part of a growing cottage industry of startups billing themselves as middle men for companies who want to offer student loan help as a perk to employees. \"That’s a large part of the future of where this industry is going,\" said David Klein, the chief executive at CommonBond, which also offers the perk to its employees. Getting in the employee student loan repayment business allows CommonBond to reach borrowers who may not qualify or be interested in refinancing their loans, he said. Employers pay a fee to CommonBond to use their platform, which allows companies to pay a worker’s student loan servicer directly. CommonBond’s announcement is the latest sign companies are wagering that employer student loan help could be big business. More than half of current students and recent college graduates said they would prefer a company offer student loan help than a health plan, according to a September survey from IonTuition, a company that helps borrowers manage their student loans. Nearly half said CommonBond’s announcement is the latest sign companies are wagering that employer student loan help could be big business. More than half of current students and recent college graduates said they would prefer a company offer student loan help than a health plan, according to a September survey from IonTuition, a company that helps borrowers manage their student loans. Nearly half said they would prefer student loan help to a 401(k) . And the more than 40 million Americans coping with $1.3 trillion in student debt offers a huge potential pool of workers who could benefit from the perk. \"It is in its infancy,\" Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Cappex.com, a college and scholarship search site, said of the industry surrounding employee student loan benefits. \"But it is attracting a lot of interest because the prospective employees, the millennials, are really interested in it.\" In 2015, just 3% of employers offered student loan repayment assistance, according to the Society of Human Resource Managers, but that number appears poised to grow. Already some major employers, including mutual fund firm Fidelity and consulting firmPwC are offering the perk and the benefit has the potential to turn into the next 401(k) with some help from Congress, Kantrowitz said. Employers who offer a student loan repayment benefit through CommonBond will also be able to provide their employees with a tool powered by the lender that they can use to sort through their student loan repayment options. Borrowers can sync their loan information with the tool and then use it to see how much their monthly payments would be under various repayment programs. The repayment options featured on the tool include refinancing, a service that CommonBond offers. Borrowers will also be able to use the tool to get more information about repayment programs offered by the federal government, Klein said. Though CommonBond doesn’t stand to benefit directly from a borrower choosing a government program, the tool will expose borrowers to CommonBond who may not qualify for refinancing or for whom it doesn’t make sense. Of course as is the case with any personal finance tool provided by a company with a vested interest in one of its offerings, borrowers should keep that knowledge in the forefront of their mind when evaluating the options presented, Kantrowitz said. \"If a lender gives you a tool that says refinance with us, you need to take that with a grain of salt because it may be no more than marketing,\" he said.\n",

So why did the U.S. government file a patent for cannabis — specifying that the plant has multiple therapeutic benefits — as far back as 1999? That's what some medical marijuana advocates are asking after the DEA declined to loosen federal restrictions on cannabis last week. To highlight the seeming contradiction, they're sharing photos of their hands featuring the patent number: 6,630,507. News Feed app-facebook Amy Dawn Bourlon-Hilterbran on Sunday . . Stop the propaganda with a \"Talk to the 6630507 Hand\". That is the number for a US government patent. Just one of the many patents on cannabis that the United States government holds. But this particular patent proves not only that cannabis is medicinal but also that it is non-toxic and therefore non-lethal.

            "Paragraph: JUDY WOODRUFF: For Republicans, the countdown to their national convention in Cleveland is on, with a major focus on who will be the vice presidential choice. The party’s nominee-to-be spent this day working to answer that question. Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, after meeting this morning in Indianapolis. Pence also appeared with Trump last night at a rally. GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), Indiana: We are ready to put a fighter, a builder, and a patriot in the Oval Office of the United States of America. We’re ready for Donald Trump to be our next president. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) JUDY WOODRUFF: Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions met with Trump today, too, as did former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He had served as warm-up act in Ohio last week. On FOX News yesterday, Gingrich likened the veep search to a certain reality show. NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former Speaker of the House: It’s a little bit like \"The Apprentice.\" You find out sooner or later who is the last one standing is. JUDY WOODRUFF: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie huddled with the candidate yesterday, after campaigning with him Monday in Virginia. Trump told The Wall Street Journal yesterday that he wants a running mate who can go on the attack to answer the attacks on him. That means going after his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. She appeared today in Springfield, Illinois, where President Lincoln long ago warned of a house divided. Clinton singled out Trump. HILLARY CLINTON (D), Presumptive Presidential Nominee: His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. JUDY WOODRUFF: But Trump is also taking fire from an unexpected quarter, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In recent days, she told The New York Times — quote — \"I can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president.\" Ginsburg made similar remarks in other interviews, and Trump fired back in an early-morning tweet. He said Ginsburg — quote — \"embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot. Resign.\" It was amid that furor that Trump’s camp said he was aiming to make a final running mate decision by Friday. And we unpack it all now with Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today, and Robert Costa, national political reporter at The Washington Post. And there’s a lot to talk about, but, Susan, let’s start with the veep search on Donald Trump’s part, very public. What do you make of this process, including his children, and all these interviews? And does it come down to these three or four people? SUSAN PAGE, USA Today: This is just one more way in which Donald Trump has changed the way we view politics, how politics works. The vice presidential search is usually something that’s very coy. They’re talking to the people who are being talked about, say they’re not interesting or try to tamp down speculation about it. In this case, we have had tryouts in front of our eyes about whether they can be at a rally with Trump, how they connect with him. So that has been different, and I think that’s been a good thing. I think we’re seeing now is a debate between Donald Trump’s head and his heart, because his head says Mike Pence is a guy who rounds out his resume, who gives him some unity with parts of the Republican Party like evangelicals and Tea Party types that he does haven’t the best relationships with. But I bet his heart is saying Gingrich or Chris Christie or just guys he would prefer to be around and rather see in that debate against Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential candidate. JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, what are you learning about all this? Where do you think Donald Trump is right now in this? ROBERT COSTA, The Washington Post: I think Susan’s spot-on with her analysis. What I’m hearing from Trump campaign associates is that Pence is at the top of the list for many of the family members who traveled with Trump today in Indiana. Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, is also said to be inclined toward the Indiana governor. But that means — that doesn’t necessarily mean that Trump has made a decision. He’s flying to California tonight with a populist conservative from Alabama, Senator Jeff Sessions. And he is continuing to try to think through his options, wondering whether he wants an attack dog or, as Susan said, someone to round out that resume. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Susan, so what does that say to us that it’s narrowed down to these four, and including, as Robert said, Senator Sessions from Alabama? SUSAN PAGE: Yes, and we’re not quite sure why Senator Sessions is on that list. He was an early supporter, and this may be a way to say thank you to Senator Sessions for standing with him. It tells us he chose only men. The standard political calculation would have had a woman in that mix as a finalist, especially since Donald Trump had some trouble with women voters. He didn’t do that. And it’s people who want to be on the ticket with him. He’s not coaxing somebody who’s reluctant to be on the ticket. He’s going to choose somebody who is out there comfortable auditioning for it. JUDY WOODRUFF: Eager for it. And, Robert Costa, what do you make again of the process? I mean, it stuck that he has his grown children in these meetings. How typical is that? ROBERT COSTA: It’s atypical. Trump doesn’t really function with a normal political organization. He counts on his family for counsel and some advisers. But this is someone who operates by making a lot of phone calls, bringing in friends and different people who he’s been with throughout his life and soliciting their advice, their take on the vice presidential search. And he’s getting a lot of political calculations thrown his way, but what’s most important to Trump, if you read his books or if you speak to him himself, he wants a rapport, he wants a connection, someone he can trust. JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, let’s turn to — well, we will find out soon enough. We’re told it is going to happen either Thursday or Friday of this week. Let’s turn to this really remarkable, I guess, series of criticisms that the Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has launched on Donald Trump. Very unusual. SUSAN PAGE: Never in modern times have we seen these kind of exchanges. When justices in the past have had a slip of the tongue, as Sandra Day O’Connor did on election night in 2000, it hasn’t been the kind of deliberate attempt we have seen by Justice Ginsburg. She didn’t just say this once. She said it to the Associated Press, and then she said it The New York Times, and then she said it to Joan Biskupic. So, this was a message she wanted to get out. And it’s managed to get The Post and The Times to editorialize on Trump’s side. So, that is something very rare in this election season. JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, how is the Trump campaign seeing this? As somebody who covers politics, how unusual does it look to you to hear a Supreme Court justice going after a political candidate? ROBERT COSTA: It is unusual. But inside of the Trump campaign today in Indiana, they are framing the justice’s comments as condescension, condescension that Trump may try to use, in his mind, for political advantage by running as someone who’s politically incorrect, anti-establishment. They think this kind of battle playing out in public could be useful to Trump in the coming months as he tries to solidify himself as someone who is an outsider. JUDY WOODRUFF: That’s my question, Susan. What kind of — does something like this have consequences down the road? SUSAN PAGE: I’m not sure this is very — I’m not sure this has big consequences. I think if you agree with Justice Ginsburg, you probably think, hey, great, I’m glad she spoke up. If you disagree with her, you’re probably on Trump’s side. There are going to be a lot of things that are very important in this election. And I think this is one of the things that’s more interesting of the moment than something with lasting political consequences. JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I want to ask you both about is what’s been going on already in Cleveland this week, and that is meetings of different Republican committees. One of them has to do with the convention, one of them, Robert, having to do with the platform. It is looking to be a pretty conservative document. What do we know about that? What does that say to us? Should we even be paying attention to it? ROBERT COSTA: The platform is very ideologically conservative. And this is a way the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee believe they can make an overture to the elements of the Republican Party that are disgruntled about Trump’s nomination. And they are saying, look, Trump may be more centrist and populist on a lot of these issues, but when it comes to the party, we’re still down the line, even hard-line conservative. What’s most important here is that the Republican National Committee is trying to tamp down any kind of revolt or uprising among these delegates against Trump. And Republican Chairman Priebus is working closely with Trump to ensure that doesn’t happen. JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they’re using this as a way to tamp down disagreement? SUSAN PAGE: But they’re creating big problems for themselves with some of the groups that after that — in that autopsy they did after the 2012 defeat, they said they needed to do — they needed to do, for instance, more to reach out to young people, to African-Americans, to Hispanics, to gay people. This platform doesn’t do any of that. The stance on gay rights, on gay marriage is more conservative than the platform that was enacted in 2012. So, in terms of appealing, say, to millennials, this is not going to do the Republican Party any good. JUDY WOODRUFF: You were telling me that it has even language in there about requiring — looking at conversion therapy for individuals who are gay. SUSAN PAGE: It has language that approves of parents using this controversial technique called conversion therapy for their gay children. That’s something that even Chris Christie signed a law banning. JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly, Robert, so are these things that we can expect Donald Trump to try to implement? ROBERT COSTA: Unlikely. If you look at Donald Trump, he had a phone call in recent weeks with Caitlyn Jenner. He’s someone who comes out of Manhattan. He’s comfortable with people of all different backgrounds and orientations. He’s not a social conservative. He’s never really been a traditional social conservative, but he’s running to be the standard bearer of a party the Times Square has moved increasingly to the right. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some interesting questions. And we will be looking at it at the convention next week. Robert Costa with The Washington Post, Susan Page with USA Today, we will see you both.

            "Paragraph: The online retailer, Amazon, currently has 22 pop-up stores in malls across America. It now plans to expand its kiosk retail operations. In this 2015 photo, a forklift operator moves a pallet of goods at a Amazon.com fulfillment center in DuPont, Wash. The Commerce Department issues its July 2016 report on wholesale stockpiles on Friday, Sept. 9, 2016. The world’s largest online retailer could be bringing its wares to a mall near you, according to Business Insider, which reports that Amazon is planning to establish up to 100 pop-up stores across the country. The pop-up kiosks differ from Amazon’s online store and its existing brick-and-mortar shop in Seattle in that they are non-permanent stalls, intended to introduce potential customers to Amazon products rather than make sales. \"We offer pop-up kiosks so that customers can try out all our new devices and learn about our services like Prime and unique content like Amazon Originals,\" Amazon said in a statement. While the vast majority of its business is transacted online, Amazon has been expanding into the brick-and-mortar world recently. The company opened its first bookstore in Seattle last year, and has announced its intention to construct more stores in San Diego, New York, Chicago, and Portland. Currently, Amazon has 22 pop-up stores in 12 states , with that number potentially set to grow to up to 100 stores by next year. California is home to six of the existing stores, with Washington state, New Jersey, New York, and Texas each hosting more than two apiece. Unlike its online store, where customers can purchase anything from laundry detergent to a television set, pop-up stores are dedicated to showcasing Amazon’s electronic products (such as the Kindle Fire or the Echo) and marketing its services, such as Prime TV. The goal is to allow customers to interface with products in the 300- to 500-foot pop-ups, thereby increasing online Amazon sales. Ironically, as sales and services become more digitally driven, some online stores are shifting back to the physical realm. Customers like the hands-on experience and discussing features with an actual person. As The Christian Science Monitor’s Jason Thomson reported in May, many online stores are seeking to grow their physical presence \"Amazon spent the first 10 to 20 years convincing people to buy online,\" Georgetown University business professor Marlene Morris Towns told the Monitor. \"Now there is a shift, with lots of online sellers moving into physical spaces.\" In February, mall operations chief Sandeep Mathrani told reporters that Amazon could hope to eventually open up to 400 brick-and-mortar stores, though he later stepped back from those claims. In May, CEO Jeff Bezos told investors that the online retailer was interested in aggressive expansion into retail. As Amazon deepens its investment in the technology and services markets, allowing customers to interface with new products has become increasingly important. One source told Business Insider that Amazon first considered establishing pop-up stores when it released the Echo, a hands free, voice-controlled speaker, in 2013. The Echo and its companion, Alexa, are some of the electronics featured at Amazon pop-up stores. Department stores, such as Wal-Mart, stopped selling Amazon electronics products in 2012. \"When you walk into a store, surrounded by everything the retailer represents – the staff, the layout, the products, the music – you get a sense of what this brand really is,\" Georgetown’s Dr. Towns told the Monitor. \"Despite the convenience and lower prices of online shopping, consumers still miss out on the 3D experience.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: It was a routine walk for one Colorado woman and her dog, but it ended in tragedy. An hour later, the dog was dead. The woman was shocked by what killed him. The three-year-old Border Collie chewed on some plants as the family took a walk through the Horsetooth Reservoir. Shortly after the walk, the dog didn't look well. He was taken to the vet. According to the vet, the plant the dog was chewing on was deadly water hemlock. In July, the plant thrives in wetlands, marshes and river banks across America, blooming with tiny clusters of white flowers. A few bites of the plant can kill a large dog in less than two hours. A dog poisoned with water hemlock may first appear nervous and pupils will dilate. This will progress to twitching, drooling, convulsions and seizures. If a tiny amount was eaten and dogs survive the toxic effects, they are often left with permanent heart or skeletal muscle damage. If dogs eat too much and don't get medical help quickly, this can be followed by respiratory paralysis and death. If your dog does eat hemlock, it's necessary to induce vomiting and get him to the vet immediately.\n",

            "Paragraph: As the list of of Colorado counties and cities that are banning recreational marijuana sales continues to grow, another small town will also go without legal weed, but not because of a lack of interest; rather due to a lack of staples. KRDO first reported about local marijuana advocate Tim Klob's petition where he helped gather nearly 600 signatures to put a measure on the November ballot to allow recreational marijuana sales and industrial hemp grows in the southeastern Colorado town of La Junta. \"I see this as a game changer for our economy,\" Klob said to KRDO. \"There’s no other industry knocking on our door right now.\" Unfortunately for Klob and for the citizens supporting the measure, the petition effort failed because Klob inadvertently violated Colorado law when he didn't staple each petition volunteer's affidavit with the signatures they collected when he turned the documents in to the La Junta city clerk's office. Though all necessary materials were included in the documents, the lack of staples voided the petition through a technicality. Klob and La Junta are now back to square one. Watch KRDO's interview with Klob here. This week, Grand Junction became the latest major Colorado city to ban retail sales of recreational marijuana by its city council members, even though several citizens requested that the issue be put to a public vote. Colorado Springs, the state's second largest city, voted to ban recreational pot shops last July and became the largest community in the state to opt-out of the state's new marijuana laws. In the state's capital city of Denver, which opted in on retail sales of marijuana, a two-year moratorium on new pot business licenses was recommended by the City Council. The United States government took a historic step back from its long-running drug war last week, when Attorney General Eric Holder informed the governors of Washington and Colorado that the Department of Justice would allow the states to create a regime that would regulate and implement the ballot initiatives that legalized the use of marijuana for adults. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed several historic measures to implement marijuana legalization in the state, establishing Colorado as the world's first legal, regulated and taxed marijuana market for adults back in May. Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 last November making the limited sale, possession and growing of marijuana for recreational purposes legal for adults 21 and over. A64 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot, can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home (with only three flowering at any given time), but that home-grown marijuana can only be for personal use and cannot be sold, however, adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot. A64 allows adults to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for recreational use even in those cities or counties that have banned retail sales. Colorado's 271 municipalities and 64 counties must decide by Oct. 1 as to whether they will allow for legal recreational marijuana sales. Recreational pot sales in Colorado cities that opt-in can begin on Jan. 1, 2014.\n",

            "Paragraph: If you live in Texas, as well as a number of other states, you have certainly seen a fence post or tree painted purple. And you probably already know not to go anywhere near it. But do you understand why? Texas and other states with the purple paint law allow residents and land owners to mark the outskirts of their territory with bright purple spray paint. Instead of building a wall or fence around the property, Texans and residents of other states with a similar law understand that purple paint means no trespassing... Why do states do this? Well because of the unpredictable weather patterns, especially considering the disastrous effect climate change is having on America’s southern states, \"No Trespassing\" signs can easily be blown away in a wind storm. Landowners need another way to mark the borders of their land. And as any Texan understands, if someone has a sprawling patch of land, how are they supposed to monitor their property’s boarders if they have to do so much on a daily basis? It’s just too much work for anyone to do on top of farming their land or managing their cattle. Because the landowners in Texas and other states with the purple paint law have so much land to watch over, they probably wouldn’t notice a single \"No Trespassing\" sign missing in the first place. It’s not like they go around checking on that every day. The purple paint law allows landowners to spray it and forget it. Besides telling any passerby that the land beyond belongs to someone, the purple mark is also known as \"No Hunting Purple.\" It signifies to hunters that this property belongs to an individual and to stay clear. It can help keep people out of their properties and keep people safe from stray bullets. The Purple paint law is not new. Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was born, first created this law back in 1987. So if you’ve accidentally wandered beyond a purple painted fence or gate, you’ve broken the law. At least now you know what it really means. A number of states utilize the Purple Paint Law in order to signify \"No Trespassing.\" Here is the list: -Texas -Illinois -Missouri -North Carolina -Maine -Florida -Idaho -Arkansas -Montana -Arizona -Kansas Does your state have the Purple Paint Law? Do you think it is a good law to institute in every state? According to Central Texas Geocachers, Purple paint markings in Texas \"must be: vertical, at least 8 inches long, at least 1 inch wide. [The] bottom of the mark should be between 3-5 feet above the ground. Markings can be no more than 100 feet apart in timberland. Markings can be no more than 1,000 feet apart on open land, [and] they must be in a place visible by those approaching the property.\" Have you heard about the purple paint law before? Or is this brand new to you?\n",

            "Paragraph: 1. Downsize Your Home © Provided by Gobankingrates downsize your home As boomers raised their families, the big house and spacious yard were perfect for those backyard soccer and football games. Now, with the kids grown and out of the house, chances are they’re paying for space that they probably aren’t using. For most people, a home is the biggest expense. Add mortgage payments, utilities, property taxes and maintenance, and you’re shelling out a lot of cash. Even if the mortgage is paid off, the property taxes, repairs and maintenance never go away. One of the best baby boomer saving tips is to downsize by moving to a smaller home, condo or possibly a rental apartment. But just downsizing isn’t enough. The baby boomer saver won’t benefit if she doesn’t do something smart with her savings. You need to be deliberate and take the actual amount you’re saving, and put that money aside — in an IRA, Roth IRA, 401k or savings account — and designate it for retirement. If not, you’re likely to spend the savings, which won’t help your retirement at all. 2. Ditch the Luxury Car © Provided by Gobankingrates downgrade your car The second-biggest money drain for most people is a vehicle, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Your vehicle drains an average of $8,558 each year from your budget, according to a recent AAA survey. In a year, you’ll shell out for car payments, insurance, gas, repairs and maintenance. If you’re driving to impress with a lean retirement pocketbook, you might want to consider selling your vehicle for a low-cost-to-own model. Luxury cars are much more expensive to own than their non-luxury counterparts, according to vehicle valuation guide Kelly Blue Book. The lowest cost-to-own luxury model was the Volvo S80 T5, at $52,104 for five years. In comparison, the 2016 Honda Accord LX was the lowest cost-to-own standard model, costing $31,587 over five years. That’s a more than $20,000 difference between a standard and a luxury model. If you trade down to a standard-model vehicle, keep it a long time and you could save an average of $4,000 per year. That could help a 52-year-old baby boomer amass an extra $80,000 by age 72. If you invest that $4,000 every year in a balanced index fund that earns 7 percent annually, the savings would be worth $184,296 after 20 years. 3. Push the Kids Out of the Nest © Provided by Gobankingrates cut off your kids We all love our kids, but if it’s a choice between living with them in old age or living on our own, consider which one you prefer. Most adult children would prefer that their parents We all love our kids, but if it’s a choice between living with them in old age or living on our own, consider which one you prefer. Most adult children would prefer that their parents live on their own in retirement Yet if you keep supporting your kids as they grow into adulthood, you’re potentially hurting them and yourself. You deprive yourself of the future retirement savings that could be going into your own account.

Remember the compounding example from baby boomer savings tip No. 2. If you stop subsidizing the kids and take those dollars and invest them for your own future now, you’re likely to yield a much sweeter retirement. 4. Eliminate All Debt © Provided by Gobankingrates get out of debt For those who have credit card balances, commit to paying at least 10 percent of your income toward your debt, suggested For those who have credit card balances, commit to paying at least 10 percent of your income toward your debt, suggested Ilene Davis , certified financial planner, baby boomer and creator of the It’s Not Just For Retirement Calculator. In fact, auto-pay the debt so that you won’t have to make a decision every month about whether or not to pay. It’s likely that with auto-pay, after a month or two, you won’t even miss the money coming out of your checking account. Creating a system of positive choices — including habits like this — can help you improve your wealth and your life, according to economist Richard Thaler and co-author Cass Sunstein, in their top-selling book \"Nudge.\" 5.

But if you’re a baby boomer who’s serious about saving for retirement, there’s proof that getting healthy can help. If you live a healthy lifestyle, you’re more likely to save money on a litany of costs, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Medical costs will decline, you’ll save money on expensive vices such as smoking and drinking, you’ll spend less money on prescription drugs and over-the-counter fixes and your food budget will drop. Start small with an app that has healthy eating tips, motivation and mini-workouts to keep you on track. 6. Aggressively Save for Retirement © Provided by Gobankingrates save for retirement If you didn’t save and invest when you were younger, forget about it. Concentrate instead on what you can do now, and max out every possible savings and investing option you have. Even if you’re in your 50s and plan to retire in a decade or so, remember that you’ll still have many ensuing years for your money to grow and compound. It’s not as if you turn 66, quit your job and then immediately spend all of your savings. The spend-down portion of your retirement is gradual. You can take advantage of the \"catch-up\" provisions in your IRA and 401k accounts. You’re allowed to contribute an additional $6,000 extra in 2016 to your 401k if you’re over age 50, and up to $1,000 extra to a traditional or Roth IRA. By maxing out all of your retirement options, and letting those dollars grow and compound in the investment markets, you could boost your retirement pot substantially over the ensuing decades. 7. Pay Down Your Mortgage © Provided by Gobankingrates pay off mortgage You can You can pay your mortgage off faster if you add an extra principal payment to your mortgage sum monthly. This can ultimately help boost your retirement savings. For example, say you have a $200,000 30-year mortgage, with a 3.9 percent fixed interest rate and 20 years remaining until the debt is paid off. If you add an extra $300 principal payment per month, you will save $23,910 in interest and pay off your mortgage six years and five months early. It’s worth noting that using your mortgage to build wealth can be risky, especially if there’s a period of economic deflation, which could also hurt your home’s value, said Kirk Chisholm, principal and wealth manager of It’s worth noting that using your mortgage to build wealth can be risky, especially if there’s a period of economic deflation, which could also hurt your home’s value, said Kirk Chisholm, principal and wealth manager of IAG Wealth . As homeowners discovered during the recent housing market crash, home prices don’t always go up, and market downturns mean you could be paying off a mortgage worth more than your home’s value. 8. Know When a Bargain Isn’t © Provided by Gobankingrates downgrade your car Bargain hunting does have a dark side, said Brent Shelton, online shopping expert with Bargain hunting does have a dark side, said Brent Shelton, online shopping expert with FatWallet.com . \"We get thousands of comments in our forums of consumers buying things they don’t need, but couldn’t resist the super-low cost.\" Simply put: A Simply put: A bargain isn’t a deal if you don’t need it, already have it or won’t use it. \"When it comes to consumer products, the majority of baby boomers have what they need, sometimes in duplicate,\" he said. \"So, to save money, simply don’t buy things you don’t need, or don’t buy more of what you already have.\" Ask yourself before pulling out your wallet: \"Does this purchase add more value to my life today than a stress-free retirement tomorrow?\" Then, you can invest the money you would have spent on stuff you don’t need, and do a great job boosting that retirement pot. 9. Budget Hacks Can Save You Thousands © Provided by Gobankingrates budgeting tips Even the smallest purchases can add up over time. And buying snacks from vending machines is one example of a bad habit that’s worth changing. Buying snacks during the day can add up to $6.95 per day, but if you brought those same snacks from home, you’d spend about $2.25. Multiply the difference of $4.70 by 365 days, and you’d have $1,715 to invest. Imagine investing that money each year in an index fund returning 7 percent. Over 20 years, that money is worth $70,307. That’s an extra couple of years of retirement money by changing just one habit. Consider these ways to save; choose several to implement, practice and make new habits. After awhile, you won’t miss the extra spending, and you’ll realize greater wealth during your retirement years. Even if you’re already retired, it’s not too late to change.\n",

            "Paragraph: Former McDonald's workers have revealed the best hacks to use at the global fast food chain to help you get your hands on freshly cooked food and secret menu items, as well as saving money.  Requesting a burger without one ingredient means staff will have to make it freshly, rather than handing you one that's been sitting under the heat lamp, while the same trick works if you ask for unsalted fries. Requesting a receipt will make employees think you're a secret shopper, so they'll serve you the freshest food - and quickly too. And you can save money by ordering a cheap coffee and asking for a free refill of a more expensive hot drink, ordering the Happy Meal even if you're an adult and ordering a McDouble with Mac Sauce and lettuce to turn it into a Big Mac.  Former staff also advised ordering a 'round egg' in your McDonald's breakfast if the item you're asking for usually contains a scrambled egg patty. The 'round egg' is a poached egg that is usually reserved for the McMuffin range and staff said it's the best variety they have .  But it can be switched into any breakfast item at no additional charge, former workers said. The hacks were shared by workers on question-and-answer website Quora from both the UK and the US, so not all will be applicable in both countries, but for the most part, their tips are universal.\n",

            "Paragraph: As part of HuffPost’s \"Reclaim\" project, HuffPost Taste will focus the entire month of July on simple ways you can reduce food waste in your own home. Photo credit: Almay Here at The Huffington Post we spend a lot of time coming up with ways to waste less food, spend less money on groceries and eat better meals. There are many tools in our toolbox to make this all possible, and today we're going to talk about one more: the FIFO method of sorting your groceries. FIFO stands for first in, first out. It's a method used in accounting, and, wait for it, at the grocery store. When the supermarket gets fresh milk in stock, for example, they place the older stuff in front and the newer stuff behind it. This ensures that the consumer will purchase the older product first, before it spoils and they have to throw it out. It's a simple concept, but an effective one. Here's what you need to do with that information: use this method at home. Putting away the groceries can sometimes feel like the worst part of this essential kitchen chore, so it's understandable if you just shove the groceries into the fridge without a second thought. We get it, but stop. Instead, move all the perishable older goods to the front and place the newer groceries behind them. This small step will ensure that you use up last week's groceries before digging in to the newer stuff. Start today and see the difference. It really is that simple.\n",

            "Paragraph: Jon Stewart now has a firm departure date from Comedy Central’s \"The Daily Show.\" The comic announced on Monday’s broadcast of the program that he will leave the show after its August 6th broadcast. The disclosure paves the way for the show’s new host, Trevor Noah, and suggests that Stewart will not hang around as candidates start to make announcements this year about running in the 2016 election for U.S. President.Stewart had said previously that he would continue to do the program until some time between July and the end of 2015. Stewart made the announcement at the very end of the evening’s broadcast, just before rolling the program’s signature \"Moment of Zen\" final segment. He offered few details about what he might do for his final broadcast, but did reiterate a contest that would give a viewer the chance to attend the program’s last taping. Stewart’s announcement sets the stage for Trevor Noah, a South African comic who has hosted a late-night program in that country, to take the reins of the series. Noah is a relative unknown in the United States and has already come under scrutiny for a series of controversial tweets made in past years that were discovered on social media after Comedy Central announced him as Stewart’s heir. The Viacom-owned network and Stewart have both come out in support of Noah, urging audiences to give him a chance before passing judgement on his humor.\n",

            "Topic: 10 Largest U.S. Markets Without A Major Pro Sports Team\n",
            "Paragraph: It's official: Las Vegas is getting an NHL team. Which means Sin City is losing its status as one of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas without a major professional sports team. For Las Vegas, an NHL team is a hard-won victory for a city that has long desired a professional team of its own. And it comes even after the city has taken the lead to become the new home of the NFL's Raiders franchise. From zero teams to potentially two -- that's quite a coup for Vegas sports fans. And it shortens the list of major metro areas that don't have a single pro sports team of their own. Here's a look at the 10 best candidates, at least in terms of metro population, now that Las Vegas is out of the way. Albuquerque, New Mexico Albuquerque might look at cities like Green Bay, Portland and San Antonio, and wonder: If they can, why not me? Those small-market cities have all managed to built very successful professional sports team despite a relatively small fan base. Albuquerque has a similar makeup: With 900,000 residents and Santa Fe not too far away, the city could make a case for supporting a pro team of its own. Instead, it is likely to be overlooked in favor of cities that are larger and in less isolated areas. But don't worry, Albuquerque residents: You've still got the minor league Isotopes. Omaha, Nebraska Between Nebraska football and the College World Series, Omaha has shown it can embrace a local sports tradition as well as any city in the country. And it seems fitting that the self-proclaimed \"Amateur sports capital of the world\" would make a decent home for a professional team.  There was a time, back in the early 70s, when Omaha was a part-time home to the Kansas City-Omaha Kings, an NBA franchise that had come from Cincinnati. Omaha hosted a handful of home games for that period of time, before the team transitioned fully to Kansas City. The Kings are now out in Sacramento, and neither Kansas City nor Omaha has an NBA team right now. Just a thought.  Honolulu, Hawaii Road games would be a nightmare, no question. That alone might make a Hawaii-based team more of a pipe dream than a viable option. But Honolulu could sustain a team, if it came: The city has nearly one million residents in its metro area, and it's a hub of tourism for the island. Some renovations to Aloha Stadium might be needed, but the local fan base would surely be fired up to have a team in competition with the mainland. Providence, Rhode Island Rhode Island's capital is home to 1.6 million people, many of whom might be happy to embrace a local team instead of a regional franchise like the New England Patriots. They've got the Pawtucket Red Sox as a minor-league attraction, but a professional hockey team would be a natural choice, and a convenient rival to the Bruins to the north. Birmingham, Alabama You could put a pro team here, but what would it be? Alabama folks care about one sport and one sport alone: College football. It's one of the few places in the country where an NFL team might not be the biggest show in town. Still, with more than 1.1 million people in its metro area, Birmingham does have the population to potentially sustain a pro team, and it was home of the Stallions in the old USFL for three seasons in the 80s. But in the long term, it's just doubtful whether its residents have any room in their hearts to adopt another sports team. Hartford, Connecticut In fact, Hartford did have a professional team once, and not too long ago, either. As one of the WHA teams absorbed into the NHL in 1979, the Whalers played at the Hartford Civic Center until 1997. Unfortunately, it wasn't a terribly successful franchise: During its run as an NHL team, the Whalers only squeaked out a single division title. Perhaps related to its mediocrity as well as the struggle of being in between the Boston and New York markets, the team struggled to build a strong local fan base. Amid low ticket sales and weak corporate support, the team moved after the 1996-97 season and became the Carolina Hurricanes. Things have fared better down south, where Carolina has won two conference championships and a Stanley Cup. Hartford, meanwhile, doesn't look close to getting another pro team anytime soon. The Patriots used Hartford as leverage in the late 90s to get new stadium built in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and it actually reached a point where New England owner Robert Kraft signed a preliminary agreement with the governor of Connecticut. Louisville, Kentucky Louisville has been a historical stopover for teams across several leagues, including the NFL, MLB, and ABA before it merged with the NBA. With nearly 1.3 million people and strong sports traditions in basketball, baseball, football, horse racing, and even boxing -- it was the childhood home to Muhammad Ali -- Louisville has always been a great sports city. Here's a thought: The Louisville Sluggers. Built-in tradition, and a potential cash cow in a city where pro sports are overdue. Virginia Beach, Virginia It's an often overlooked metropolitan area, but Virginia Beach and the surrounding area home to 1.7 million people. With neighboring Norfolk in that metro area and Richmond in the general vicinity, Virginia Beach could easily pull in enough fans to support a professional team. Locals have talked for some time about building an area to accommodate an NBA or NHL team. Now that Las Vegas is off the board, Virginia Beach is near the top of the list for largest cities without a pro team of their own. Surely the calls for their own pro team will grow louder. Austin, Texas If its current growth rate holds, Austin may well come off of this list one day. The city's population has seen double-digit growth in recent years, as young people have been flocking to the Texas state capital.  Pro teams abound in Texas, split between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. But Austin's nation-leading growth might build a case for a team of its own. Riverside-San Bernadino, California Welcome to Riverside and San Bernadino, California, which form the largest metro area that still doesn't have a pro team of its own. With nearly 4.5 million residents, Riverside-San Bernadino is the 13th largest metropolitan area in the country. But it stands in the shadow of the nearby Los Angeles metro area, which has sports teams to spare: Two MLB, two NBA, two NHL, and at least one NFL franchise, with another possibly on the way. Southern California is saturated with professional teams, which makes Riverside-San Bernadino a tough sell to the sports leagues. Size matters, but it isn't everything. At least L.A. isn't too far away.\n",

            "Topic: The fastest-growing alcoholic beverage in the US isn’t a beer, wine, or spirit\n",
            "Paragraph: Fermented apple juice used to be big in the US—or, rather, in the 13 British colonies that became the US. In colonial America, hard cider was more popular than whiskey, wine, and beer; scholars estimate that 18th-century residents of Virginia and Massachusetts were each drinking between 15 and 35 gallons of the stuff a year. During the 19th century, though, consumption declined, and the spirit never quite recovered after the era of prohibition. Today hard cider accounts for roughly 1% of the US beer market, according to Dan Rowell, CEO of the Vermont Hard Cider Company, whose Woodchuck Hard Cider is one of the top-selling American brands. But Rowell and other cider makers are witnessing a veritable boom in business, perhaps owing to a deepening interest in craft brews and the wave of adults seeking gluten-free alternatives. Like beverages brewed from grains, fermented apple juice comes in many tastes, and it’s just as ripe for small-scale, local appeal. Rowell recently told the Los Angeles Times that he predicts cider will capture 5% of the beer market before 2020. A new Woodchuck Hard Cider processing facility opened in Vermont in August; it’s 100,000 square feet and reportedly can fill and cap 600 bottles of cider a minute. Since 2009, hard cider has been the fastest-growing segment in the alcoholic beverage industry. Accordingly, big companies like MillerCoors and Heineken are getting in on cider pressing. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer company, introduced Stella Artois Cidre in 2013 and Johnny Appleseed hard cider in March 2014. Analysts predict that Boston Beer Co., which makes Samuel Adams beers, will owe a fifth of its sales volume to its Angry Orchard brand of cider by the end of 2015. Angry Orchard has climbed past European brands such as Magner’s Irish Cider to become the top-selling cider brand in the US. (Surprisingly, though, the Boston Globe reports that Angry Orchard makes its cider from apples harvested in Italy and France. That may be because there aren’t enough cider-worthy apples in America to meet the increased demand.) Some cider makers are hoping for policy changes related to the way alcoholic beverages are labeled in the US, arguing that current rules make the definition of \"cider\" too narrow. It can have only 7% alcohol by volume before being taxed as wine, and can only be lightly carbonated before being taxed as sparkling wine. Cider makers have said this is too fine a line to walk, especially since it’s tricky to predict exactly how alcoholic their experimental small batches will be. They’re lobbying to have the federal definition of hard cider changed to accommodate 8.5% alcohol by volume and to mimic EU standards on carbonation. Alcoholic cider has been popular in the UK for at least a decade and reportedly accounts for 15% of the beer market there.\n",

            "Paragraph: With the multitude of reasons why people try to sue (read: get over on) larger corporations, this woman's lawsuit against Chipotle isn't insane; it's the price that's got people going nuts. A report from Fortune says a California woman by the name of Leah Caldwell is actually suing Chipotle, the national chain serving people with the finest in Mexican grill, for $2.2 billion. Yes, that's a \"b.\" That's reportedly what the company would make in profit over a nine-year period. Why? Because they used a photograph of her without her consent. The lawsuit states that a photographer took Caldwell's picture in 2006 at a Chipotle restaurant in Denver, and she refused to sign a release form. It looks like she figured that was enough to keep her photo out of whatever Chipotle ads are out there, but she was surprised to find out in 2014 that her picture was not only on display in an Orlando Chipotle, but in additional Chipotles across California. What's worse? Her likeness was altered, which apparently shed \"false light upon her character associated with consuming alcoholic beverages.\" The image was said to have had bottles added to it, and also remixed her hairstyle. Now, that's not right. If someone takes your photo for a company and you're like, \"Nah, I'm good on not having my likeness be a part of your corporation,\" that should be enough. You can't Photoshop my features then think everything is cool. The problem is, even if you were used in advertisements and, as you say, helped the company turn a profit, that's not necessarily easy to prove in court unless you have access to Chipotle's earnings statements based on each of the advertisements they distributed during whatever period you assume it's live. Essentially, while I ride for Caldwell sticking it to the man, she might be wylin' if she thinks she'll get anywhere near $2.2 billion. Judge Judy wouldn't even let her cook. Good luck to you, though.\n",

            "Paragraph: California Assemblyman Rocky Chávez announced Tuesday that he is exploring a bid for the Golden State's open U.S. Senate seat in 2016, becoming the first sitting Republican lawmaker to take a formal step toward running for retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer's seat. Chávez, who represents part of San Diego County, has opened an exploratory committee, allowing him to fundraise for the statewide race. \"Our nation suffers from a lack of clear leadership when it comes to issues of national security and looking out for California families who have seen stagnant wage growth for almost two decades,\" Chávez said in a statement. \"My story is like that of so many other California families, having worked in the grape fields with my uncle and cousins as a child to seeing one of my own children attend an Ivy League medical school. That's the American Dream, and it's what every parent hopes to see for their own children. But if we don't take steps to protect our nation and help create more opportunities for our children, we risk losing that Dream.\" While Boxer's retirement spurred a flurry of activity among the state's high-profile Democrats, California conservatives haven't been as eager to jump in what is likely to be an expensive campaign. Well-known Republicans like Rep. Darrell Issa, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and 2014 gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari have all denied interest in the seat. \"I would love to say a Republican has a really decent chance,\" Republican strategist Beth Miller told the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. \"But right now, given what the political landscape looks like in California, it will be an uphill battle for any Republican.\" On the Democratic side, California Attorney General Kamala Harris announced her candidacy last month. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Reps. Adam Schiff, Loretta Sanchez and Xavier Becerra are also considering running. Chávez has served in the state Assembly since 2012.

In the DVD commentary for Deadpool, lead actor and producer Ryan Reynolds reveals that it cost the project about $10,000 (which dwarfs what some crew members make on big budget films) to have his character wear a tank top illustrated with actress Bea Arthur's face, Empire Magazine recently reported. In the comic books, Deadpool is Arthur's self-proclaimed \"number one fan\" and likes to watch episodes of The Golden Girls. The writers even named the spaceship for the Deadpool Corps \"The Bea Arthur\" in her honor. So, it seemed natural for the actress to play a role in the film—at any cost. In the commentary track, Reynolds said that showing the tank top in the film was \"potentially cinema's most expensive Easter Egg ever,\" adding that \"as a producer, I had to approve that $10,000 ... You can’t have a Deadpool movie without Bea Arthur.\" To check out the commentary and other special features for yourself (and to spot the Bea tee), grab a copy of Deadpool on DVD or Blu-ray here via Amazon.

            "Paragraph: The first hours By the early hours of Friday 24 June, it will be clear if the UK has defied the experts and pollsters by voting to leave the European Union. If that happens, a shattered David Cameron, his leadership already a matter of speculation, will have no option but to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street saying he will respect the mandate of the British people. The Treasury, Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) will move quickly to roll out well-hidden battle plans to prevent market chaos. A shocked European political class will find itself grappling with an unprecedented, messy and sprawling divorce that could rumble on for years. The EU will respond as it does to any crisis, and convene an emergency summit, probably as early as the weekend. As the morning unfolds it will quickly become clear that although the basic Brexit procedures are set down in law with some clarity, the politics, timeframe and potentially explosive brinkmanship will bring deep uncertainty and new disputes between the Brexiters and Europe. EU commission officials, for instance, claim the UK will rapidly discover it has put itself in the role of supplicant, and they even talk of throwing the country out on its ear. Jean-Claude Juncker has already warned the UK should remember that deserters are not greeted with open arms. \"It is in our interest to do the divorce as quickly as possible. There’s no appetite for negotiating new terms in the first two years,\" one source says. Others, mainly in the leave campaign, contend that a more stately, considered pace to the divorce is possible. They deny the EU holds all the cards in shaping a new relationship between an independent UK and a jilted Europe. The weekend (24-26 June) Saturday night on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury in 2015. The high watermark of summer: as the Glastonbury faithful turn their attention to the headliners, and football fans gear up for the knockout phases of the European championships, officials in London and Brussels will be weighing a very different knockout. Rapidly the discussion will move to the processes of Brexit, and the irreversibility of the decision. Only Greenland (on achieving self-rule) and Algeria (on gaining independence from France) have left the European bloc, and the only legal pathway out of the current EU is through article 50, inserted in the 2009 Lisbon treaty. This allows a country two years to negotiate the terms of its exit from the moment it notifies the EU of its intention to leave. A Brexit vote does not represent that formal notification. Those playing for time will argue that six weeks must be allowed for legal challenges to the referendum result, so at the very least it might be best to wait for the result to be immune from legal interference. But once the notification is triggered, negotiations cannot extend beyond a two-year notice period, unless all remaining EU member states agree to such an extension. It would therefore take just one member state to insist the divorce must happen at the end of the two years. Arguably, and this will be contested, the UK could at some point in the two years reverse its decision to leave. If, for instance, the deal offered by the EU were very poor, nothing in the EU treaty would prevent the UK government going back to a largely pro-remain UK parliament to seek a second referendum. Week one Mario Draghi and George Osborne in 2015. Will the EU have a Draghi moment over the Brexit vote? The EU’s instinctive response to a UK Brexit vote will be one of self preservation. An emergency summit is likely to seek the equivalent of the \"Draghi moment\" when the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, announced he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. With markets in turmoil, and Eurosceptics across Europe emboldened, the European political class will want a joint declaration of a determination to continue, possibly as an even more integrated Europe. Divisions will start to emerge. Countries with strong ties to the UK such as Malta, Cyprus and Poland may plead for caution. Slovakia, which will hold the presidency of the council in the second half of 2016, is reluctant to see the UK go. The inclination across Brussels will be to treat the UK harshly so Brexit cannot be presented to other sceptical states as a cost-free option. \"It will be imperative to prevent the Brexit contagion gripping other countries,\" says one EU official. The French and Germans, facing challenges from their own Eurosceptics in 2017 elections, will demand action. They will want to know what kind of future relations with Europe the UK proposes. At issue will be the UK access to the single market and the continuance of the free movement of labour. Andrew Duff, a former Liberal Democrat MEP, who helped devise article 50, says: \"The EU could not allow a seceding state to spin things out for too long. The clause puts most of the cards in the hands of those that stay in.\" By the end of the week, the UK may find itself excluded from some EU meetings as the remaining 27 decide how to structure the withdrawal negotiations, based on proposals from the executive commission. Week two Inside the UK, Cameron will either fall on his sword, prompting a leadership contest at a point of economic turmoil, or say he has a duty to negotiate an exit, perhaps staying on until the autumn. He has said he would immediately trigger article 50 because \"the British people would rightly expect that to start straight away\". George Osborne has said that \"this is crucially important, the one way the European Union itself has a legal basis to negotiate our exit is to trigger article 50. Article 50 would be triggered immediately and that process would begin.\" The trigger would be pulled with a fortnight, Osborne added. However, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director for Vote Leave, says an immediate move to set article 50 in motion would be \"mad and like putting a gun into your mouth and pulling the trigger\". Meanwhile, Michael Gove claims the remarks by Cameron and Osborne need to be filtered through the prism of the referendum campaign. It is in the interests of Cameron and the commission to play up the risk of a Brexit vote. In reality, once defeated in the referendum the political authority of the Cameron-Osborne axis will have been blown away. The mantle will have passed to Gove, and to Boris Johnson. Both men have said there is no need to rush to the exit door. The next few weeks MPs before the Queen’s speech. Most of them back remain. The shell-shocked 450-strong majority for remain in the House of Commons will have gathered its forces. A consensus will form that it would be best for all sides to take their time. From Cummings’ point of view, time will be needed over the summer for the EU to admit it is in its self-interest to retain a close trading relationship with the UK. At play will be the UK’s continued membership of the single market, and free movement of EU citizens. But Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska of the pro-EU Centre for European Reform says delaying for too long \"might be unacceptable for the EU partners\", further eroding goodwill and weakening their negotiating hand. The UK, by extending the agony, would be an unwanted participant in EU meetings. So politically Britain will not be able to delay in perpetuity, and by the autumn the pressure for an article 50 notification will be overwhelming. Autumn 2016 Talks on fish stocks are likely to be prolonged. Once the article 50 trigger is pulled, the EU council of ministers, now certain that Brexit is happening, will by qualified majority voting agree a negotiation mandate, in the form of directives to the commission. The full scale of the task facing Whitehall will become clear. The UK will have to renegotiate 80,000 pages of EU agreements, deciding those to be kept in UK law and those to jettison. British officials have said privately that nobody knows how long this would take, but some ministers say it would clog up parliament for years. Greenland, with a population of 55,000, took two years to negotiate its exit. Brexiters often point to farming or fisheries as relatively easy to negotiate, yet 60% of UK food and drink exports go to the EU and 60% of fish. The EU and Norway spend four months negotiating a fisheries deal for 40 stocks. Yet EU-UK fisheries negotiations would have to contend with 140 stocks. A senior UK official said: \"The honest answer is nobody knows how long this would take and we would all be making it up.\" Winter 2016 One scenario is that the first set of negotiations surrounding withdrawal will be completed inside two years. They will cover issues such as residual EU budget payments to and from Britain, the acquired rights of UK citizens in Europe and the reciprocal rights of EU citizens in the UK, the pensions of British EU civil servants and relocation of EU agencies based in the UK. However, longer-term issues such as future trade relations, including tariffs, are likely to be dealt with separately. 2017 The negotiations will be grinding on, and the Brexit campaign may find some of its optimism about a new trade deal was unfounded. Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, has claimed \"we will be able to trade with the single market on free-trade terms, without paying into the system or accepting freedom of movement\". He insists that access will be tariff-free, and that the UK is uniquely well placed to strike such a deal thanks to its large trade deficit with major EU countries. Elliott has reasoned: \"I cannot imagine, the day after Britain votes to leave, Angela Merkel allowing a situation where the British markets were cut off for BMW or any of the other companies. Ditto the French farmers, the Italian fashion companies and what have you.\" Others say this is overly optimistic. Cameron, for instance, has pointed out that 44% of UK exports go to the European Union, while just 8% of what the EU exports goes the other way. In short, he says, Britain is the one in greatest need of an agreement. Striking a trade deal on services, especially the critical financial services, will be difficult as France and Ireland eye a chance to end the dominance of the City of London, and grab business. Equally UK negotiators will find it hard to get countries such as China interested in negotiating a separate trade deal with the UK, as opposed to the whole EU. As all this emerges from the Brussels negotiations, the UK parliament may assert itself and demand a closer relationship with the EU than the one envisaged by Brexiters. One model is offered by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area. Another is Switzerland’s relationship with the EU – in effect a series of bilateral treaties. MPs will start to use the Commons to rein in Gove and Johnson. If no trade deal is struck they will become increasingly worried as the UK will have no choice but to trade with the rest of Europe under World Trade Organisation rules. The House of Commons foreign affairs committee recently spelled out the implication of this: \"If no deal could be concluded within the two-year notice period, the UK would move to standard WTO relationship terms and would then need to decide which of the 6,987 directly applicable EU regulations would need to be replaced by UK law.\" Late 2017 to 2018 The French and German elections will be over. Eurosceptic parties will possibly have suffered because of the evident difficulties the UK is experiencing in its negotiations. The drawbacks of life outside the EU will have been clear to French and German voters. Let’s imagine one far from implausible outcome. The EU has played hardball with the UK and the deadline for Brexit is imminent. Last-minute talks are due to start, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, insists he will bat for Britain through the night. With few bargaining chips at his disposal, he strikes a deal on the narrow terms of the UK exit but the future trading relationship is unclear. By default, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union and will trade with Europe under WTO rules outside the single market, facing tariffs on exports. This deal – such as it is – will need to be agreed by a qualified majority in the council of ministers. Any remaining UK allies in the council will be outvoted. Consent of both the European and UK parliaments will then be required, followed by ratification by member states. The UK, now outside the EU, will return to Brussels to reopen its trade talks.

            "Topic: A crucial election for Hong Kong: What's at stake?\n",
            "Paragraph: Hong Kong chooses its next leader on Sunday in a vote overshadowed by fierce divisions over stalled political reform in the city. It is the first chief executive election since Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by mass pro-democracy rallies in 2014. Protesters wanted fully democratic elections for their leader - but Beijing refused. Pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong has called the current electoral process \"a selection rather than an election\". In a nutshell: What is happening? A small group of mainly pro-Beijing electors will choose from three candidates to succeed outgoing leader CY Leung. His deputy, Carrie Lam, is Beijing's choice for the top job. But her main rival, former finance chief John Tsang, is the public's favourite, according to opinion polls. The pro-democracy camp are backing Mr Tsang in a likely unsuccessful bid to keep Ms Lam out. The third candidate is retired judge Woo Kwok-hing. So who does get to vote? Ordinary Hong Kong people have no say. Instead, Hong Kong's 1,200-seat Election Committee, a mostly pro-Beijing body, will decide on the next leader. The Legislative Council's 70 members - half of whom are directly elected - form part of this committee. But most of the members are elected by business, professional or special interest groups. Critics say entities that lean towards Beijing are given disproportionately large representation. In the most recent selection for the Election Committee, pro-democracy activists secured 325 seats on the committee - the highest number ever. However, this does not give them enough seats to control who becomes the next chief executive. How does it work? Candidates need 601 votes to win. If no candidate reaches this total, the top two candidates go to a second round. Incumbent CY Leung limped over the line with 689 votes in 2012 - despite having Beijing's backing. \"689\" then became a pejorative nickname for the unpopular leader - and Beijing will want its choice, Ms Lam, to do much better. Who's in the lead? In the nominating round, Carrie Lam secured 580 votes, just shy of the winning mark. Woo Kwok-hing got 180 votes and John Tsang secured 165, just over the qualifying threshold of 150. Beijing has made it clear that it backs Ms Lam and there are multiple reports of lobbying behind the scenes on her behalf. John Tsang is seen as the main threat, given the high levels of public support for him. Though pro-establishment, he is seen as the more moderate choice, and more than 300 pro-democracy committee members say they will vote for him. It's the first time the pan-democrat camp has backed an establishment candidate. Mr Tsang also has support from some pro-establishment voters, but this is unlikely to be enough to defeat Ms Lam. So what are the candidates like? Carrie Lam has served as Hong Kong's chief secretary - the number two position - for five years and has almost four decades of public service behind her. She has been praised as a strong administrator but is despised by the pro-democracy camp for backing a mainland ruling saying that while residents could vote for their leader in 2017, they could only choose from a list of pre-approved candidates. She's been nicknamed CY2.0 - another version of the outgoing Mr Leung. She's also been accused of being out of touch with voters after gaffes including a bizarre search for toilet paper and a failure to use a transport swipe card. John Tsang is also a career civil servant and Hong Kong's longest-serving financial secretary. Praised for having a common touch - he's got almost 270,000 Facebook followers - he's called on Hong Kong's divided residents to come together. But he's been criticised as financial secretary in the past for under spending on social welfare to preserve budget surpluses. His nickname is \"Pringles\", or \"Uncle Chips\", for his resemblance to a snack mascot. Mr Woo served as a High Court judge for many years. He is seen as moderate and pro-establishment, and is popular with some activists and young people who feel he is not \"tainted\" by politics. But analysts say Ms Lam and Mr Tsang as seen as the two contenders with a chance of winning. Would either bring Hong Kong closer to the vote? It seems very unlikely. In 2015 pro-democracy lawmakers rejected Beijing's offer of universal suffrage for the chief executive election if the candidates were pre-approved by the Chinese government, and the proposal was voted down. As a result, this election is being conducted under the existing process. Carrie Lam advocated on behalf of Beijing's position and has expressed reservations about restarting the political reform process, saying \"We need to ask ourselves very seriously whether we have any prospect of achieving a consensus before we trigger another intense debate in society\". John Tsang initially expressed similar sentiments but then promised to relaunch the process \"with the greatest determination and courage\". But he says Beijing's framework must be the starting point for any movement. Regardless of either stance, there has been no sign Beijing is willing to compromise on this. There are also signs it is getting bolder about interventions in Hong Kong, including its lobbying for Ms Lam, its role in blocking two pro-independence lawmakers from the legislature and the recent abduction of a billionaire from a hotel in Hong Kong. So what's the mood? The mass pro-democracy rallies may have ended but many young people remain unhappy. Joshua Wong, who led the 2014 protests, has refused to back any candidate and will be protesting outside the election venue. \"No one will deny that Carrie Lam is the worst one and a nightmare for us - but it doesn't mean we can put aside our principles and endorse any pro-China candidate,\" he told AFP news agency. A human rights group is organising a march as the polls take place and Hong Kong police say 1,800 officers will be deployed - more than the total number of electors. But it is also true to say that during the political ructions of the last three years - from Occupy protests to the politicised \"fishball\" clashes - there have been Hong Kongers who expressed support for the status quo.\n",

            "Topic: Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians They Hit\n",
            "Paragraph: In April a BMW racing through a fruit market in Foshan in China’s Guangdong province knocked down a 2-year-old girl and rolled over her head. As the girl’s grandmother shouted, \"Stop! You’ve hit a child!\" the BMW’s driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl. The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time. When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: \"Don’t say that I was driving the car,\" she said. \"Say it was my husband. We can give you money.\" It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true, it’s fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: \"It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.\" This 2008 television report features security camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat’s back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother’s body. He then speeds away from her corpse. Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao’s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for \"negligence.\" Zhao’s case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, \"You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one.\" \"Double-hit cases\" have been around for decades. I first heard of the \"hit-to-kill\" phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near-miss of a motorcyclist, he said, \"If I hit someone, I’ll hit him again and make sure he’s dead.\" Enjoying my shock, he explained that in Taiwan, if you cripple a man, you pay for the injured person’s care for a lifetime. But if you kill the person, you \"only have to pay once, like a burial fee.\" He insisted he was serious—and that this was common. A Slate Plus Special Feature: How Can This Possibly Happen? Geoffrey Sant wrote about drivers in China who intentionally kill pedestrians. Ask him anything. Most people agree that the hit-to-kill phenomenon stems at least in part from perverse laws on victim compensation. In China the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small—amounts typically range from $30,000 to $50,000—and once payment is made, the matter is over. By contrast, paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions. The Chinese press recently described how one disabled man received about $400,000 for the first 23 years of his care. Drivers who decide to hit-and-kill do so because killing is far more economical. Indeed, Zhao Xiao Cheng—the man caught on a security camera video driving over a grandmother five times—ended up paying only about $70,000 in compensation. Security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. In 2010 in Xinyi, video captured a wealthy young man reversing his BMW X6 out of a parking spot. He hits a 3-year-old boy, knocking the child to the ground and rolling over his skull. The driver then shifts his BMW into drive and crushes the child again. Remarkably, the driver then gets out of the BMW, puts the vehicle in reverse, and guides it with his hand as he walks the vehicle backward over the boy’s crumpled body. The man’s foot is so close to the toddler’s head that, if alive, the boy could have reached out and touched him. The driver then puts the BMW in drive again, running over the boy one last time as he drives away. Here too, the driver was charged only with accidentally causing a person’s death. (He claimed to have confused the boy with a cardboard box or trash bag.) Police rejected charges of murder and even of fleeing the scene of the crime, ignoring the fact that the driver ran over the boy’s head as he sped away. These drivers are willing to kill not only because it is cheaper, but also because they expect to escape murder charges. In the days before video cameras became widespread, it was rare to have evidence that a driver hit the victim twice. Even in today’s age of cellphone cameras, drivers seem confident that they can either bribe local officials or hire a lawyer to evade murder charges. Perhaps the most horrific of these hit-to-kill cases are the ones in which the initial collision didn’t injure the victim seriously, and yet the driver came back and killed the victim anyway. In Sichuan province, an enormous, dirt-encrusted truck knocked down a 2-year-old boy. The toddler was only dazed by the initial blow, and immediately climbed to his feet. Eyewitnesses said that the boy went to fetch his umbrella, which had been thrown across the street by the impact, when the truck reversed and crushed him, this time killing him. Despite the eyewitness testimony, the county chief of police declared that the truck had never reversed, never hit the boy a second time, and that the wheels never rolled over the child. Meanwhile, one outraged website posted photographs appearing to show the child’s body under the truck’s front wheel. In each of these cases, despite video and photographs showing that the driver hit the victim a second, and often even a third, fourth, and fifth time, the drivers ended up paying the same or less in compensation and jail time than they would have if they had merely injured the victim. With so many hit-to-kill drivers escaping serious punishment, the Chinese public has sometimes taken matters into its own hands. In 2013 a crowd in Zhengzhou in Henan province beat a wealthy driver who killed a 6-year-old after allegedly running him over twice. (A television report claims the crowd had acted on \"false rumors.\" However, at least five witnesses assert on camera that the man had run over the child a second time.) Of course, not every hit-to-kill driver escapes serious punishment. A man named Yao Jiaxin who in 2010 hit a bicyclist in Xian and returned to make sure she was dead—even stabbing the injured woman with a knife—was convicted and executed. In 2014 a driver named Zhang Qingda who had hit an elderly man in Jiayu Pass in Gansu province with his pickup truck and circled around to crush the man again was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Both China and Taiwan have passed laws attempting to eradicate hit-to-kill cases. Taiwan’s legislature reformed Article 6 of its Civil Code, which had long restricted the ability to bring civil lawsuits on behalf of others (such as a person killed in a traffic accident). Meanwhile, China’s legislature has emphasized that multiple-hit cases should be treated as murders. Yet even when a driver hits a victim multiple times, it can be hard to prove intent and causation—at least to the satisfaction of China’s courts. Judges, police, and media often seem to accept rather unbelievable claims that the drivers hit the victims multiple times accidentally, or that the drivers confused the victims with inanimate objects. Hit-to-kill cases continue, and hit-to-kill drivers regularly escape serious punishment. In January a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow. In April a school bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again. In May a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child. And last month the unlicensed woman who had killed the 2-year-old in the fruit market with her BMW—and then offered to bribe the family—was brought to court. She claimed the killing was an accident. Prosecutors accepted her assertion, and recommended that the court reduce her sentence to two to four years in prison.\n",

            "Topic: How To Profit From Trump Inflation\n",
            "Paragraph: To get rich the way real estate billionaires do: (1) Buy assets. (2) Finance with fixed-rate debt. (3) Wait for inflation. Leveraged real estate has created many an American fortune. It worked in the late 1970s, when rising inflation caught lenders flat-footed and delivered windfalls to property owners. It could work again, if fiscal policy reignites inflation. That could happen. President-elect Trump has in mind trillions of dollars of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In fact, his fiscal policies could do more to build the Trump family's wealth than all the business self-dealing that the press and good-government watchdogs are obsessing over. Unexpected inflation creates winners and losers. Borrowers--you, if you have a fixed-rate home mortgage--take home gains. Lenders--you again, if there are long-term bonds in your retirement account--suffer losses. Big investors bet on rising prices by acquiring debt-financed apartment buildings and commercial real estate. Small investors can do it by owning real estate investment trusts. And what better time to own REITs, says Robert G. Smith, who oversees $12 billion in portfolios at Sage Advisory in Austin, Texas, than when you have one of the most prolific builders as your president. Investor excitement following the election came in a spurt for some sectors. Drugmakers and banks enjoyed a relief rally on the expectation that regulations will be relaxed. Companies that would capture road-building dollars, like Caterpillar and Vulcan Materials, had their run-ups. The postelection rally left real estate out. Equity REIT shares are now off 14% from their July peak, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. What's going on? Income investors, despairing of the tiny yields on Treasurys, were turning in desperation to riskier assets like REITs. When the yield on the ten-year Treasury started an ascent from its 1.4% low in July, REIT yields climbed as well. That sent their share prices down. But perhaps investors have confused nominal and real yields. Inflation raises nominal yields on conventional mortgages and bonds, as bondholders seek compensation for being repaid in shrunken dollars. But an income stream from real estate is closer to a postinflation return, explains Jean-Michel Wasterlain, chief executive of Capfundr, a New York City real estate fund manager. A rising CPI eventually pushes up both the rents that a property owner collects and the price that the asset would fetch in a sale. Wasterlain has data to prove the point. He compared yields on Treasury bonds and net rental yields (called capitalization rates) on investment real estate over the past 37 years. When inflation drove up the nominal yields on bonds and drove down bond prices, it did not push up real estate yields or push down real estate prices in like manner. Average cap rates have mostly kept inside a range of 6% to 9%, even as the yield on the ten-year Treasury lurched between 2% and 14%. Inflation expectations are rising (see chart, above). Predictably, the bond market is in retreat. But property values are holding up, Wasterlain says. Indeed, far from damaging property values, inflation would help property owners who have paid for their assets in part with fixed-rate debt. Their rents climb, but their mortgage payments don't. Inflation winners should include equity REITs (the ones that own buildings, as opposed to mortgages). The average equity REIT has debt equal to 31% of the value of its assets, according to the REIT association. A lot of this debt is at fixed rates, Wasterlain says. The largest REIT exchange-traded fund is Vanguard's (VNQ). You could also look for an inflation shield in funds that own commodities (DBC), gold bullion (IAU), goldmine shares (GDX) or inflation-protected Treasury bonds (SCHP). The borrowing class includes homeowners. If you believe that Trump is going to do what he says he's going to do with spending and tax cuts, says Wasterlain, you should leverage your home. Borrow as much as you can at 4% because in a few years interest rates will be higher and property values will be higher. Debt, of course, comes with risk. Expected inflation may never arrive; past warnings about inflation, made on these pages and elsewhere, have not yet been vindicated. REITs have their own hazards, reflecting the fact that they are more sensitive than property values are to what's going on in the stock market. The prices of equity REITs crashed 67% in the last downturn. But you can get some reassurance from the fact that one important person has reason to root for inflation's return. Donald Trump has much of his net worth tied up in real estate, and he is not hesitant to borrow. The FORBES wealth team estimates that his fixed-rate debts add up to $800 million.\n",

            "Paragraph: No Man's Sky is finally released in the UK and other regions today, 10 August, after making its consumer debut in the States yesterday and it is already hitting the headlines with almost as much vigour as Pokemon Go. The latest nugget to get tongues a-wagging concerns the game's famed \"multiplayer\" element. Developer Games has often claimed that the No Man's Sky universe is persistently online and players all inhabit it. But it has also constantly said because the playing field is so massive (18 quintillion procedurally generated planets), and players initially spawn in completely random areas, the chances of meeting another real human being are \"almost zero\". It certainly didn't expect that to happen on day one. Two players have posted proof on Reddit that they not only spawned close to each other, they set out to meet. And they ended up in exactly the same spot in the game, on the same planet, in the same galaxy, but things didn't quite turn out as expected. Twitch broadcaster TheSadCactus (TheGalacticCactus on Reddit) discovered that a system he visited had already been named by a different player, Psytokat. Whenever a new system or planet is found it can be renamed by the first player to arrive, so he knew that Psytokat else must have travelled through recently (as the game had only been out for a day). He arranged to meet his compatriot nearby and they headed to the same planet. They found a landmark and waited for each other to turn up. Neither did. That is to say, both arrived there but couldn't see each other. What's more, the lighting and area ambience was different. \"We are 100 per cent in the same station same spot and everything and we cannot see each other,\" said TheSadCactus. There are several speculated reasons for this. It could be a glitch, after all the game only went live yesterday and the servers were flooded. It could be that the two players were split into different lobbies online. Or it could be that you actually can't meet other players at all. Hello Games' founder Sean Murray had revealed in the past that it was possible to meet others, even suggesting that other players would be able to tell you what you look like: \"You can't see yourself,\" he told The Late Show's Stephen Colbert. \"The only way to know what you look like is for somebody else to see you. \"But the chances of that are incredibly rare because of the size of what we're building.\" Conspiracy theories aside, we wonder if it really matters. Hello Games has said all along that No Man's Sky is a single-player experience with some multiplayer factors, such as the naming and discovery of planets. And in that it does its job very well. It is, from what we've played so far, thoroughly engrossing.\n",

            "Paragraph: USA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills \"During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza. \"The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. \"Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. \"That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company... which has been around since my grandfather,\" he said. \"Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades – and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. \"At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. \"Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages. \"In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens – filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work – since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing. \"The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Over the past few years, a lot of the advertising in the wireless space has involved the major players going back and forth over either network quality or price. In recent months, however -- even though Verizon (VZ) has clung to that tactic with its \"better matters\" campaign -- the two upstarts in the space, T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S), have pushed the idea that rough network parity has been achieved. Sprint has even started using Paul Marcarelli, the man who asked \"can you hear me now?\" for Verizon for years, in its latest commercials. In those ads he pushes the notion that the difference between the best network and the worst is only 1%. Verizon and maybe AT&T (T) might dispute those numbers, but it's clear based on a Verizon and maybe AT&T (T) might dispute those numbers, but it's clear based on a new study from Market Force Information that having the best network is not the only criteria for having satisfied customers. In fact, the survey of 8,600 consumers showed that value plays a big role in keeping people happy. Which carriers have the happiest customers? Market Force asked survey participants to rate their satisfaction with their primary wireless carrier and its services, as well as their likelihood to refer that brand to others. Those results were averaged to create what the research company calls the \"Composite Loyalty Index.\" The survey showed that of the four major full-service carriers, T-Mobile had the highest score, just beating second-place Verizon. And, as you might expect, T-Mobile CEO John Legere took to social media to celebrate the win tweeting \"No surprise here...guess who's at the top. The #uncarrier. #WeWontStop.\" Perhaps most interestingly the research found that satisfaction levels are actually higher among people using non-contract carriers. In that category Consumer Cellular came in first followed by Cricket, StraightTalk, Metro PCS, Boost Mobile, TracFone, Virgin Mobile and U.S. Cellular. Why are non-contract companies better-liked? It's important to note that many of the major non-contract brands are actually owned by the four major carriers. AT&T owns Cricket and Consumer Cellular operates on its network. T-Mobile owns Metro PCS while Sprint owns Boost Mobile. Market Force found that 62% of wireless customers have a contract, 33% do not,and 5% use pre-paid phones. \"We were intrigued to find that, for the most part, consumers are more delighted with non-contract wireless providers than with traditional, full-service carriers,\" said Market Force Chief Strategy Officer Cheryl Flink. \"This could be attributed to the fact that wireless users believe non-contract carriers provide a better perceived value to their customers based on factors like price, coverage, and flexibility to change plans.\" What sets the full-service carriers apart? Market Force found that T-Mobile customer are happiest with the value offered by the company as well as ease of changing plans and access to new cell phone technologies. The survey showed that those factors could outweigh the categories generally associated with network quality because T-Mobile actually came in last for frequency of dropped calls. Verizon easily led the network coverage category and Sprint came in at or near the bottom for every category. These results show that good customer service, clear plans, and decent pricing can cover up for deficiencies in other areas. Consumers don't all forgive T-Mobile for not having as good a network as Verizon, but enough do to put it at the top of the overall rankings. That suggests that T-Mobile should grow as it improves its network and Verizon would do the same if it worked on being a little easier for consumers to work with.\n",

            "Topic: Did ‘Wheel Of Fortune’ CHEAT a Contestant Out of $1 Million Opportunity Over a Technicality?\n",
            "Paragraph: (This story has been updated with quotes from the contestant.) Did the massively popular game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" cheat a contestant out of a chance to win a million dollars? That’s what some are wondering after what happened recently on the show. It appears that a curious pronunciation of the phrase \"Corner Curio Cabinet\" is at the center of the controversy. That’s because recent contestant Paul Atkinson landed on the tiny million-dollar slice of the wheel, correctly guessed there were a some Cs in the puzzle, and then decided to solve it. The only problem? He pronounced it \"Corno curo cabinet.\" The Wheel of Fortune rules clearly state that proper pronunciation of the word or phrase is required to win each puzzle. So host Pat Sajak had to break the bad news to Paul. \"Well, it’s one of those– it just didn’t come out the way you intended it to,\" Sajak told a flummoxed Atkinson after the next contestant immediately solved the puzzle. \"Paul, you’ve proved what several players have proven and I prove almost on a nightly basis: Sometimes your mouth says what your brain doesn’t intend for it to,\" Sajak later said. ABC reports that the unlucky Atkinson claimed he had never seen the word before and that may have contributed to his mispronunciation, \"I was nervous! I’ve got Pat freaking Sajak to my immediate right ... I’ve got lights and cameras in my face ...\" Calling it his \"biggest nightmare,\" Atkinson continued, \"I knew I messed up,\" he said. \"I knew something awesome could’ve happened, but I totally goofed it.\" The clip from the episode is popping up online and people are weighing in on both sides of the argument: It should be pointed out that this was not a million dollar puzzle, however. If the judges had accepted Paul’s pronunciation, he would not have instantly won a million dollars. Solving that one puzzle and beating the other two contestants would have moved him to the bonus round where the $100,000 marker on the wheel is replaced by a one million dollar card. To win the big bucks, Paul would have still needed to spin the wheel, land on the million, and correctly solve the final puzzle. And this is not the first time something like this has happened. Perhaps you recall a similar story from December of last year. A contestant named \"Renee\" believed that she had correctly solved puzzle seen below: However, instead of saying \"Seven Swans A-Swimming\" – the contestant dropped the \"g\" in Swimming saying, \"Seven Swans A-Swimmin.'\" Host Pat Sajak had to break the bad news to Renee and basically handed the win to the next contestant. A few minutes later, Sajak explained that Renee had used \"the vernacular\" pronunciation in her answer, and that’s a no-no on Wheel of Fortune. Watch that clip: Do you think this was fair?

            "Paragraph: Much has been made about the $10,000 gold Apple Watch Edition, and how unattainable it is for most of us. But one clever consumer decided to take matters into his own hands, and create a gold Apple Watch almost from scratch. The price? About $10 — the cost of a can of spray paint. YouTuber Casey Neistat shows how easy it is to make your own gold Apple Watch with just a little care and a steady hand. (Warning: Don't try this at home unless you're okay with possibly destroying your $349 to $399 investment.) The end result may not fool anyone who looks at your wrist too closely, but at a glance, Neistat's gold-sprayed aluminum Apple Watch looks pretty sweet.\n",

            "Paragraph: NBC’s Olympics nightmare has all but come true: Prime-time viewership for Rio is down 17% from the London Games in 2012. At a conference in June, NBC CEO Steve Burke explained what would constitute an Olympics \"nightmare,\" Bloomberg reports. \"We wake up someday and the ratings are down 20%,\" he said. \"If that happens, my prediction would be that millennials had been in a Facebook bubble or a Snapchat bubble and the Olympics have come, and they didn't know it.\" That nightmare is basically here, as the Olympics saw a sharp viewership dip for the first time since 2000. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, the damage is even greater than 20%, sitting at a 25% drop-off, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That's bad news for NBC, which paid $12 billion to lock up the rights to the Olympics through 2032. There is, however, a slight silver lining. About 24% more people have streamed the Rio Olympics through NBC's app and website than streamed the London Games over the same period. NBC told Bloomberg that 78 million unique users had streamed the games through Tuesday. And NBC has actually been able to charge 50% higher ad rates for internet ads than for those on TV because of the younger audience, NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus told Bloomberg. But that good news should be put into harsh perspective: 98% of people still watch the Olympics on TV, the medium that has seen its audience plummet.\n",

            "Paragraph: I just took a look at my 401(k) portfolio returns for last year. I didn't beat the market, but then, I never do, and that's fine by me. Tax time provides a great opportunity to see where you stand. So why should I be sanguine about being an underachiever? First of all, half of my portfolio is in income vehicles like bonds, so there's no way I'll ever beat the market at large. I'm cool with that. Then there's my prohibition against active management and buying individual stocks. Well, almost. I make a bet with less than 1% of my portfolio. The rest is in passive index funds. What's good advice for last year is even better for this year. There will still be plenty of volatility -- despite the recent rally -- so don't be bamboozled into thinking you can dart in an out of the market to avoid trouble. You'll just lose money. Here are three rules to keep in mind: -- Bet Across the Board and Keep Your Money on the Table. As noted above, you'll lose money nearly every time you decide the market is too pricey or too volatile. You'll lose money because you'll guess wrong on when to leave and get back in. So just stay put in an allocation that makes you feel comfortable. For me, since I'm within 10 years of my retirement age, half stocks and half bonds is fine. A good rule is your age should match your bond holdings. If you're 25, then a quarter of your portfolio should be in bonds. If you're 60, then 40% should be in stocks. It's not a perfect guideline, but it protects you a little more from stock market risk over time. -- Stay Passive, Invest in Index Funds. Most managers and investors who trade actively fail to beat basic market benchmarks. This is a consistent fact. In 2016, the success of passive investing was proven once again. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, their Persistence Scorecard showed that only 2% of large-company funds beat the market average over the past 12 months. No long-term government fund beat the benchmark. So pick an index fund for everything you want to own: Global stocks, bonds and real estate. Spread out your money based on your age and risk tolerance. Then only review it once a year. Unless you feel real uncomfortable with your returns, don't do a thing. -- Have a Solid Plan and Stick To It. Sure, there's going to be lots of distractions. You'll see the top performers from last year and want to invest in them this year. But pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Most stellar performers can't repeat their best years. Less than 1% of large-cap funds and no mid-cap or small-cap funds managed to remain in the top quartile over five consecutive 12-month periods, the S&P study found, painting a negative picture regarding the lack of long-term persistence in stock mutual fund returns. What's more important than chasing returns? 1) Saving as much as you can, 2) Lowering investment expenses so that you can save even more, and 3) Knowing how much to save for a comfortable retirement. If you can focus on those three items this year, you'll be ahead of most people. But that involves ignoring headlines, market sell-offs and broker recommendations. There's a real power in having a plan and staying on course.\n",

In an incident in 1986, dubbed the Ealing Vicarage Rape, three men broke into Saward’s family home, drunk and high on drugs, while Saward, who was 21 at the time, was watching television with her boyfriend, David Kerr. Her father, vicar Michael Saward answered the door and was threatened with a kitchen knife. Two of the men repeatedly raped Jill at knifepoint and brutally attacked her boyfriend and father. But just under a year later, the judge caused outrage when he said Jill’s trauma \"had not been so great\", and gave one of the men more years for the burglary than the rape. Jill suffered flashbacks and nightmares for three-and-a-half years following the attack, and came close to suicide three times. Her identity was kept anonymous throughout the criminal trial, but she made the decision to write a memoir and speak publicly about what happened to her. Jill went on to valiantly work as a case worker for a council’s domestic violence forum, and as a lobbyist for the rights of and support for rape victims. She campaigned to dispel the stigma surrounding rape to help victims not feel shame. She also bravely spoke out about forgiving her attackers. She died at the age of 51 after suffering a stroke.

            "Paragraph: Tesla will soon accept deposits for its long-awaited mass-market electric car, but analysts cautioned would-be consumers not to get too optimistic about how little they'll really pay and how soon they can get behind the wheel. The Model 3 is a sedan with a $35,000 price tag and the potential to travel 200 miles before recharging the battery. The company said it will be available in late 2017. Starting on March 31, buyers can reserve one with a $1,000 deposit. Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 11, 2016 Tesla has a lot riding on the rollout of the Model 3. It's supposed to transform Tesla into a mainstream carmaker rather than a niche producer for the wealthy. Consider the $80,000-and-up Model X, a crossover SUV unveiled in September. Tesla's struggling stock rebounded on Thursday, a day after the company revised its sales forecast for 2016 upward, to 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles. There's a lot of hype around the Model 3 -- some drummed up by the company, and some created by the media. With the announcement that Tesla will begin accepting orders next month, some news reports said motorists would pay as little as $25,000 for the Model 3. Those enticing predictions bank on consumers receiving tax incentives. The federal government gives a $7,500 tax credit to electric car buyers, and some states have additional rebates. Sounds great, right? The federal program, however, is limited to the first 200,000 vehicles sold by a manufacturer, according to Bloomberg. Then, it gradually gets eliminated. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he wants the company to sell 500,000 cars by 2020, so the opportunity for Tesla buyers to cash in on the tax incentive is clearly limited. There's also a question of whether the company will deliver the Model X on time. Blowing deadlines has troubled Tesla before. The Model X debuted in September, about two years behind schedule. A Morgan Stanley analyst told Bloomberg he believes the Model 3 will launch a year late in 2018. Unlike the Tesla's Model X, there will be no limited-edition \"signature series\" version of the Model 3 with special features, Musk tweeted.\n",

            "Paragraph: By Dorene Internicola NEW YORK, Sept 23 - Exercise trends come and go as step aerobics yield to interval training, weight machines are tossed for medicine balls and Pilates falls in and out of fashion. But when it comes to exercise habits, Americans say they prefer to stick to what's simple, solo and short. Nearly 75 percent of 1,200 adults, aged 24 to 44, questioned in an online survey about exercise habits said they worked out at least once a week and 77 percent prefer to do it alone. Running was the most popular type of exercise followed by lifting weights and biking/hiking/outdoor activities, according to the survey by the watch company Timex. \"If it's true, it's good news for the fitness industry,\" said Dr. Walter Thompson, who studies exercise trends for the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Thompson said the survey probably provides a \"useful snapshot\" into the behaviors of the responding age group. \"Outside that group,\" he said, \"it's a little dangerous.\" Sixty one percent of people questioned in the poll during the last two weeks of August said they don't exercise in a gym, and the average American is no early bird. Only 27 percent said they found time to get in a workout during the work day. Thompson cautions that people tend to exaggerate, at least a little bit. Some 29 percent of those surveyed said they spend between 30 minutes and one hour on their physical activities and 18 percent claim between one and two hours. \"Ask people 'How much do you weigh? How tall are you? And I'm pretty sure most people will tell you they're taller,\" he said in an interview. \"We know that among the general population about 20 percent exercise regularly, not say they do but do, and about, 80 percent don't exercise.\" ACSM recommends adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio-respiratory exercise per week. As for the 26 percent of those polled who don't exercise, Gregory Chertok, a sport and exercise psychology consultant for Telos Sport Psychology Coaching in New York, said the reason may be simply that they don't think they can. \"It's called the concept of self-efficacy,\" he said of the term coined by psychologist Albert Bandura in the 1970s. \"When people doubt their ability to accomplish a task, when they don't feel competent, motivation plummets,\" he said. Conversely, he added, adherence to an exercise routine skyrockets when people consider it non-negotiable. Chertok said even the anonymous closeness of a gym environment can have a positive effect on the lone exerciser in it. Studies have shown that peoples' happiness depends on the happiness of people in physical proximity to them. \"The act of working out near or next to other health-minded gym goers can influence your own desire to be health-minded,\" he explained. So how malleable are exercise habits and how can they be changed? \"Many experts are jostling with that very question. While it's tempting to say people aren't exercising, people are becoming more educated, more influenced by social media,\" he said. \"Things are going to change. Slowly, over time.\" (Editing by Patricia Reaney and Sandra Maler)\n",

            "Paragraph: At some point toward the end of every job interview, the hiring manager will likely turn the tables and ask, \"Do you have any questions for me?\" This is the time to ask smart, thoughtful questions — perhaps your final opportunity to assess whether the job would be a good fit, and your final chance to impress the hiring manager. Business Insider recently spoke with Becca Brown, cofounder of Solemates, a brand of women's shoe-care products, who knows a thing or two about interviewing. Before launching her own business, Brown, who has a bachelor's from Harvard University and an MBA from Columbia, spent a lot of time interviewing job candidates at Goldman Sachs, where she held various roles, including analyst, wealth adviser, and chief of staff. She was also part of the investment bank's Harvard recruiting team, she says. \"I interviewed anywhere from 20 to 30 job candidates a year, so in total, I interviewed over 100 people at Goldman Sachs,\" she tells Business Insider. She says that candidates asked her some impressive questions — like \"What's the most challenging part of your job?\" and \"What's one of the most interesting projects you've worked on?\" — but there was one question she always hoped she'd be asked, but almost never was: \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\" \"I like this question — and yet no one ever asked it — because it's difficult to answer,\" she says. \"It's an important question for anyone to be asking him or herself, and so if ever a candidate were to ask this question, it would have stood out.\" She continues: I think this is a good question for interviewees to ask because, as a candidate, if you see where the person interviewing you is headed, you can decide if that trajectory is in line with your career objectives. While they don't have to be completely correlated, it's helpful for the candidate to have some indication of the interviewer's direction. Get the latest Goldman Sachs stock price here.\n",

            "Paragraph: We all know it is not easy to avoid the unhealthy stuff, but which food is hardest of all? Iulian Valentin/Shutterstock If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate. \"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist. \"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write. To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors. Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs. The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected. Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries. However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. Using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. Several other foods – all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both – were tightly bunched behind. At the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. Even water ranked higher than these. Strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. A match-up between caffeine and pizza’s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time.\n",

            "Paragraph: Google's eye in the sky just got a bit sharper. The company has deployed new imagery from NASA's Landsat 8 observation satellite in Google Maps and Google Earth, Program Manager Chris Herwig wrote in a blog post Monday. What this basically amounts to is much crisper imagery when you're using the \"satellite\" function on Google Maps, which shows locations as they would appear in real life. The difference is actually substantial. Google offered two satellite images of New York City to showcase the change. It's a night-and-day difference -- move the slider in the middle to see for yourself: As you can see, the new image is more detailed. Getting such clear photographs involves a lot of data. \"We mined data from nearly a petabyte of Landsat imagery—that’s more than 700 trillion individual pixels—to choose the best cloud-free pixels,\" Herwig wrote. \"To put that in perspective, 700 trillion pixels is 7,000 times more pixels than the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels than the estimated number of galaxies in the Universe.\" Bottom line? That's a lot of detail. Be careful sunbathing in your backyard this summer.\n",

            "Paragraph: Forget whether or not there is water on Mars - if this photo is to be believed, there is fresh beer on the red planet's surface. An eagle-eyed Mars 'anomaly hunter' has spotted a strange object that looks like a green bottle in Nasa rover imagery. The bizarre bottle shape appears to have a red, green and white label and even a cork or cap at the end. Scroll down for video  Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, when people see patterns in random, unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places. On the red planet, one of the most famous is the 'face on Mars' spotted by one of the Viking orbiters in 1976. This was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes.   The pictures were taken by Nasa's Spirit rover during a mission on the surface of Mars in November 2007. Vigilante Mars 'anomaly hunter' Thomas Miller, 64, spotted the strange shape while he was sifting through Curiosity's latest snaps of the red planet. 'This find is exceptionally clear; the design of the bottle is a bit different but recognisable,' Mr Miller, a Canadian musician, told MailOnline. 'Of course there's no way to know for sure it's a beer bottle, I'm going out on limb calling it that. 'If someday we visit their planet it would be nice to think we could sit down and have a beer with them.' The anomaly hunter found the bottle while browsing through panoramas of Nasa images stitched together by other Mars enthusiasts. 'I think it is evidence of current habitation on Mars,' he told MailOnline. 'We find trash, tools, machine parts, bits of paper, as well as sculpture and carved stone tablets. I tend to see artifacts on the Martian surface as part art gallery and part garbage dump.' But Nigel Watson, an alien expert and author of the UFO Investigations Manual, is sceptical of the bottle find. 'I think they are looking for anything out of the ordinary, and our minds like to see patterns in things. Given the thousands of images of Mars, you are bound to find something that looks a bit unusual,' he told MailOnline. 'Usually clearer pictures or those taken from a different angle show that such anomalies are really rocks or tricks of the light.'  The strange bottle shape is not the first oddity to be spotted on Mars. In December last year, Nasa's Curiosity rover took footage that appeared to show a large spoon on the red planet's surface. It is the second 'spoon' to be found on Mars in recent years, with alien hunters claiming it could be proof of developed life on the planet. Other objects such as rings and gloves have also been found in recent years.  The Curiosity video was uploaded to YouTube by UFO Hunter account 'secure team' with the description: 'There is a giant spoon on Mars! This thing is amazing! Probably left over from a lost civilisation.' And some users were amazed at the discovery - one said: 'Wow, it couldn't possibly be natural, could it?' However, others were more sceptical, suggesting it could be an optical illusion. One user commented: 'We see what we want to see. Some folk see the face of Jesus in tea-leaves, others see the man in the moon.'  Netflix will AXE its five-star rating system next month in favour of a Facebook-style thumbs up or down\n",

            "Paragraph: There is no denying that video gaming technology has evolved at an incredible pace over the past few years—but it seems like we have to pay for that in a big (and literal) way. Video games are becoming more and more expensive. And the problem is not just that the base purchase costs more—it is that there is now an abundance of DLC which you have to pay more for later in the year. The problem is that DLC is no longer really \"optional\"—just something cool and extra for hardcore fans of a game. The DLC is more often than not actually necessary . The original release of the game which you initially pay for is rather bare-bones, and you need the DLC to really get something out of the experience. Take Battlefield 1. The base price for the game is $70. That is expensive, but not absurd. The problem is that if you start adding up the costs for all the extensions, that amount quickly balloons. The final (and real) price tag? It is closer to $120. Ouch. It gets even worse if you want the Take Battlefield 1. The base price for the game is $70. That is expensive, but not absurd. The problem is that if you start adding up the costs for all the extensions, that amount quickly balloons. The final (and real) price tag? It is closer to $120. Ouch. It gets even worse if you want the Collector’s Edition . This comes with a deck of playing cards, a 14-inch statue, a messenger pigeon tube, a cloth poster, and some exclusive DLC. Also included are a Deluxe Edition copy of the game and an exclusive patch. The price for all of this? $220. Sadly, there was a time when DICE was trying to avoid this. Six years ago, Patrick Back, senior producer, said, \"We don’t ever want to charge for our maps and insisted to EA that this attitude was crucial when it came to keeping our community happy and playing together.\" ...

            "Paragraph: With such a high interest in vampires these days — they're all over television, movies, and bookstore shelves — many people may be wondering if humans really can survive as vampires. Turns out, sucking blood isn't just fiction fun: In 2011, a 19-year-old Texas man named Lyle Bensley allegedly broke into a woman's apartment and bit her on the neck. This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault. But is it safe to drink blood? In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out. [Circulatory System: Facts, Function & Diseases] The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. [7 Strange Ways that People Act Like Vampires] Because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders. Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: \"No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,\" Browning said, according to BBC. Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book \"The Science of Vampires\" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, \"requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.\" You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us. If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim.

The complaints allege that its upstart rival's cameras can lose about 5 frames per minute. The suits come two weeks after Vievu sued Taser on the claim that the company had illegally lobbied officials in the city of Phoenix to abandon a $3.6 million camera contract that Vievu had recently won. The body-camera war has also included skirmishes in New York City, where Vievu's win of a $6.4 million body camera contract sparked similar accusations about the quality of its products and a fierce lobbying campaign by Taser. Last month, amid questions over the contract, the tussle led Mayor Bill de Blasio to complain of a \"smear\" campaign against Vievu. In a statement to Fast Company in response to Taser's new lawsuits, John Collins, a Vievu spokesman, said the company \"believes in its cameras and technology, and looks forward to a full discovery process in which the public can see Taser's underhanded tactics in full view.\" Taser, the market leader, has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that its cameras are simply superior to its rivals. And as it develops its software and cloud storage ecosystem for video, the company is also determined to be known as an innovator. As CEO and cofounder Rick Smith explained to me, the technology vision is much bigger than hardware: The coming generation of cameras will be bolstered by live-streaming, object and face recognition, and artificial intelligence.

I'm a Republican and the party's basic core is government out of your life and the right to be left alone.

The mobile dating app unveiled the huge new game-changing feature on Friday, allowing members to share profiles of potential matches with friends. Now, you can use the \"share’ button to send the link to the profile to a friend. After receiving the link, the friend has 72 hours or five clicks to decide whether or not to follow your suggestion. It’s more than just a fun new feature — it’s also part of a larger effort by Tinder to kick its reputation as an app that promotes hookup culture, a common criticism of the company, according to a CNET report. Some call the app a revolution in dating, while others see it as bad for normal human relationships. The new feature has some support from the scientific community. Duke University and Harvard Business School collaborated in 2014 for a study on playing matchmaker, and found that it increases the general happiness of the population. Rosetta Pambakian, who is a Tinder vice president, said that this was one of the most popular requests from users, which drove the company’s decision to add the feature, according to the report. \"We are testing the ability to play matchmaker on Tinder,\" reads a statement on Tinder’s website. \"While swiping through potential matches, a small group of users may see the option to share a profile they come across. Tapping the ‘share’ icon will allow you to send a temporary link via text to a friend, and give them the ability to swipe on the profile you shared.

            "Topic: Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay\n",
            "Paragraph: If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour. Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.) Notice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall. The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade. Other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women. Bailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure. Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average). Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far. The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed. There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal. Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off. The Olympic tax Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress. But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error. The Fed Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question. The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates. Number of the week Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers.\n",

            "Paragraph: Like Kobe beef and halibut sushi, much of what you see labeled as jamon iberico is not what you think it is. Though the narrative of acorn-fattened pigs roaming the woodlands of western Spain is popular, it appears to be a misleading one: Most ibe1rico pigs spend their short, unremarkable lives slopping up provender on factory farms. Since the price and quality of jamon iberico vary widely—high-end examples can fetch more than $200 a pound—Spain’s Ministry of Agriculture rolled out designations a few years back that minimize the guesswork. White, green, and red tags denote pork that’s typically mixed-breed and frequently fed with grain, not acorns. Purebred, acorn-fed iberico pigs are tagged with black labels. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, where shoppers are less conversant in Spanish ham-speak, the color-coded tags will likely prove useful. Roughly 20,000 tons of the black-hoofed hams were exported last year alone, up 25 percent from the year before. Eighty percent of exported iberico goes to EU countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and France. Japan, the U.S., and Mexico make up the majority of the remaining 20 percent.  But there is a movement in the U.S. to develop its own American versions of the world's most exclusive cured meat. Acornseekers, based in Flatonia, Texas, was the first to bring Iberico pigs, a breed indigenous to Spain and Portugal, to the U.S. for commercial production. La Quercia, an Iowa-based farm that sells its pork to high-end shops such as Eataly and Murray's in New York, has its own \"acorn proscuitto,\" made from nut-foraging Missouri Tamworth pigs. And on Feb. 5, Georgia-based  White Oak Pastures held a dinner to celebrate its first harvest—featuring its pigs flown in from the dehesa savannas in southwest Spain—and included chefs from Spain who led the preparations. Compared with conventional hogs, the indigenous Iberian species matures far more slowly, bears smaller litters, yields less meat, and requires vast swaths of acorn-rich pastureland (the Spanish government mandates at least five acres per animal). Which is why, according to the Asociacion Nacional de Industria de Carne de España, the largest association representing the Spanish meat industry, 95 percent of jamon labeled as iberico is actually mixed-breed. And why authentic jamon iberico is so much pricier. With that in mind, here are five questions to ask before your next jamon purchase if you’re seeking quality over price, whether traditional Spanish or the newest American offerings:  Breed: Was the pig pure-breed or mixed? Diet: Was it fed wild acorns or industrial fodder? Lifestyle: Was it free-range or farmed? Curing: Was it three years (the minimum for pure-breed iberico) or 700 days (the minimum for cross-breed)? Lifespan: Did the pig enjoy one or two years of grazing? If the latter, it leads to a more complex final product. Avelino Garcia, a bespectacled charcutero who’s been carving ham in Madrid’s Pacifico market since 1970, said his customers spring for the acorn-fed stuff on holidays and special occasions only, for the most part. \"Sure, we’ve come a long way since the dime-a-dozen chorizo sandwiches of the Franco era, but jamon iberico will always be a luxury product.\" Corrects second-to-last paragraph about the curing process\n",

            "Paragraph: In a press conference on Wednesday, Chinese officials appear to have confirmed what many observers have long suspected: that China is no longer in control of its space station. China's Tiangong-1 space station has been orbiting the planet for about 5 years now, but recently it was decommissioned and the Chinese astronauts returned to the surface. In a press conference last week, China announced that the space station would be falling back to earth at some point in late 2017. Normally, a decommissioned satellite or space station would be retired by forcing it to burn up in the atmosphere. This type of burn is controlled, and most satellite re-entries are scheduled to burn up over the ocean to avoid endangering people. However, it seems that China's space agency is not sure exactly when Tiangong-1 will re-enter the atmosphere, which implies that the station has been damaged somehow and China is no longer able to control it. This is important because it means Tiangong-1 won't be able to burn up in a controlled manner. All we know is it will burn up at some point in late 2017, but it is impossible to predict exactly when or where. This means that there is a chance debris from the falling spacecraft could strike a populated area. Fortunately, it's unlikely anyone will be injured. Most of the parts of the space station will burn up in the atmosphere, and the few that do make it to the ground probably won't land in any populated areas. (It's a big planet.) Still, watch the skies late next year. You never know what could be falling down on you. Source: Xinhua News via Space.com\n",

            "Paragraph: The following is an excerpt from ORIGIN Magazine. Interviewer: Maranda Pleasant Maranda Pleasant: What are you passionate about in life? Bellamy Young: For me, singing. I wouldn’t make it through the day without singing. It is my solace and my meditation and my release. It lets me know how I’m processing things, what I’m processing, if I’m out of touch in some area. I will just think, why am I singing? Then I will know everything I need to know about what I’m feeling. But also, kindness. That is what thrills me, personally. Small acts of kindness; thoughtful, large acts of kindness. I feel like we’re in a bit of a precipice, and I think that any beautiful energy on the kindness continuum will just help us fall into a lovelier place. From the fear and constriction that’s sort of always pulling us back and keeping us in old modalities, I feel like any expansive act of kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity, helps tip the scale toward a more conscious, liberated existence for everyone. The smallest act has repercussions for the universe. MP: How do you keep your center in the middle of chaos? Do you have a routine? BY: I have to meditate before I go to bed, always. I have to let the day go and let the eternal in. Sleep is such a potent, liminal state, and I don’t want to drag anything in there that doesn’t need to be there. I get a lot of work done in my dreams and I don’t want to take anybody else’s work with me. We all got plenty of work in this life, so for sure I have a very simple seated meditation practice before bed. But equally helpful to me is a walking meditation -- to be in nature, to not be attached to my electronics, and to just be instead of be doing. And yoga, always. The union. MP: How do you process pain, emotional pain, when it comes in? BY: I process it like a teacher. The more I resist anything, the stronger it gets. I have to welcome the pain like I welcome the joy. And the pain is always bringing me a lesson. If I listen to the lesson when the pain is manageable, the pain won’t get gargantuan and flatten me entirely, because I will have received the message at the center. I receive it as gently as I can, because the cruelest thing that I do to myself is try to push myself through an experience. If I’m feeling hurt, sad, lonely, depressed, and then I shame myself for feeling that, then that’s a black hole for me. I really have worked a lot to meet pain with both gratitude and gentleness. You gotta love yourself, because when you’re hurting -- you never know who’s gonna be around to do the lovin’ for ya. You gotta love yourself through the pain. MP: Such a joy to talk to you. What is love to you? BY: Love is a true unconditional space to me. To love someone or to be loved is to be seen, and I think, gosh, as humans, all we want is to be seen, to be heard, right? To be valued. To be respected. But mostly just to be held in a safe, unconditional space. MP: What causes on the planet are you passionate about? Anything that’s near to your heart? BY: For me, it’s adoption. I am adopted, so of course it means the world to me personally. But also even animals. There’s a lot of life on the planet that needs love, wants love, deserves love, in whatever capacity we are able. I feel it is a blessing, a duty, an honor, that we give the love that we have, and we share the lives that we have with our fullest heart. Souls finding each other and sharing love through this road. I foster a lot. Not humans, animals. MP: Let’s talk about your current project. You’re on the most loved television show right now on any network. Scandal is an unprecedented blessing in my life. I’ve never dreamed of a blessing like this -- to be in this family of people where everyone is so grateful and so hardworking, and to be given these words to say that are so honest and so complicated and so nuanced. Nothing is all good or all bad, nothing is black or white, everything is just messy and human and difficult. We’re meeting it all with our best moment but we are failing, and that is an amazing opportunity for an actor. Not to mention the monologues. The writing I have right now is unbelievable, a gift. It’s all really beautiful! Scandal is like a really, really beautiful thing. Also, this summer I’m getting a little album off the ground. MP: I did not know that! BY: It’s going to take a minute, and it’ll happen in its own time, but I feel so grateful that singing is back in my life, and that I have an opportunity for this. I’m just trying to open my heart and open some doors and let it all come together the way it’s supposed to. MP: Can you tell me a little bit about the album? BY: It’s all very, it’s all just nascent. Coming together now. The conversations are fun and evolving. MP: This has been such a pleasure. BY: It’s my pleasure.\n",

            "Paragraph: Forty-eight years after the original \"Sound Of Music\" hit the big screen, Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer are getting ready to step into some pretty epic shoes: Maria and Captain von Trapp's. As longtime \"Sound Of Music\" fans get ready for NBC's live performance, which airs Thursday, Dec. 5, we thought we'd take a look at where the cast of the original film version of \"The Sound Of Music\" has landed. Charmian Carr, Liesl von Trapp No longer 16 going on 17, Charmian Carr is now a mother of two and an interior designer in California. Although she gave up acting eventually, Carr fondly recounted her experiences on the \"Sound Of Music\" set in her books \"Forever Liesl\" and \"Letters To Liesl.\" Nicholas Hammond, Friederich von Trapp Now a resident of Australia, Nicholas Hammond is an actor, writer and producer. But his work doesn't shy away from his \"Sound Of Music\" days: Hammond recently worked on and starred in an award-winning documentary called \"Climbed Every Mountain with Nicholas Hammond,\" which explores the true story of the von Trapp family. Heather Menzies, Louisa von Trapp After taking on several roles in the '70s and '80s and even posing nude for Playboy in 1973, Menzies went on to become an advocate for cancer patients and their families. She is now a mother of three and the founder of the Uhrich Foundation For Cancer Research, named for her late husband. Duane Chase, Kurt von Trapp Perhaps due to middle child syndrome -- at least when it came to the von Trapp family -- Chase left acting behind shortly after \"The Sound Of Music\" to pursue a career in geology and computer software design. He now lives in Seattle with his wife. Angela Cartwright, Brigitta von Trapp After a post-\"Sound Of Music\" acting stint that included a starring role in \"Lost In Space,\" Cartwright went on to become an author, photographer and artist. She has two kids and several books in the works. Debbie Turner, Marta von Trapp All that time in the hills of Austria may have done Debbie Turner some good: After finishing high school, Turner went on to become a professional skier. She now has four daughters and her own floral design and event company. Kym Karath, Gretl von Trapp The youngest von Trapp went on to appear in several TV shows in the '60s and '70s, including \"Lassie,\" \"My Three Sons,\" \"Lost In Space\" and \"The Brady Bunch.\" She is now an actress and developing a TV show in Los Angeles. Julie Andrews, Maria von Trapp Although her major claims to fame are still her roles in \"The Sound Of Music\" and \"Mary Poppins,\" Julie Andrews -- now known as Dame Julie Andrews -- appeared in \"The Princess Diaries\" in 2001 and went on to voice characters in movies such as \"Shrek Forever After\" and \"Despicable Me.\" Christopher Plummer, Georg Johannes von Trapp An Academy- Emmy- and Tony-Award winner, Plummer most recently appeared in films such as \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\" \"Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight\" and more. In 2011, he became the oldest actor to take home an Oscar for his role in \"Beginners.\"\n",

            "Topic: Here Are All The Atheists In Congress\n",
            "Paragraph: It's becoming more common not to believe in God or organized religion these days, so it would only be natural for a few atheists to have made their way to Congress, right? Below, we've managed to cram all of the atheists serving on Capitol Hill into one important GIF: Yeah, there isn't a single admitted atheist currently in Congress. For purposes of demonstration, however, the cat can represent former Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), who left Congress in 2012 as its only avowed atheist. Much like the flying feline, he fell a bit short of his mark after having his legs taken out from under him by another Democrat, thanks to California's \"top-two\" primary election system. A few months after retiring, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also announced his nonbeliever status, a declaration he made more than 25 years after coming out as the first openly gay member of Congress. That Frank felt more comfortable going public with his sexuality in 1987 than he did with his secular beliefs at any point during his House career says a lot about the stigma surrounding atheism in electoral politics. In 2011, Herb Silverman of the Secular Coalition of America told the Guardian that his group was aware of 27 members of Congress other than Stark \"that have no belief in God.\" It's unclear who they were, or are, but none of them -- perhaps except Frank -- have since decided to speak out. Atheists may have thought they had a new congressional ally last year, when Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won a seat in Arizona's 9th Congressional District. Sinema's staff has since regularly pushed back against the \"nonbeliever\" label that had initially been ascribed to her, instead clarifying that the congresswoman prefers a \"secular approach.\" Though Sinema \"does not consider herself a member of any faith community,\" her communications director has said, she \"is a student of all cultures in her community.\" The political picture looks no brighter for atheists in state legislatures, many of which have laws barring nonbelievers from holding public office. By most counts, there's only one atheist currently in office: Nebraska state Rep. Ernie Chambers, an independent who has not shied away from his secular views and belief in the separation of church and state. The total lack of atheist congressional representation is somewhat surprising in the broader context of nationwide faith and non-faith trends. The latest Pew poll on religion found that out of nearly 20 percent of Americans who call themselves unaffiliated, 2.4 percent identify as atheists. Another 3.3 percent are agnostics, and about 14 percent described their religious beliefs as \"nothing in particular.\" More than a quarter of those \"nothing in particular\" respondents said they don't believe in God or a universal spirit. While other polls have similarly shown a growth in secular beliefs as the unaffiliated trend away from organized religion, trust of atheists remains a key hurdle to getting those views represented in public office. A poll taken during election season last year found that only 54 percent of Americans would vote for a \"well-qualified\" atheist presidential candidate. While this was the highest total since Gallup began asking the question in 1958, atheism proved the biggest negative influence on a hypothetical candidate's viability, with fewer respondents saying they would be willing to vote for an atheist than either a gay or a Muslim candidate. Another survey taken in 2012 found that 50 percent of Americans believe atheism is \"threatening\" to them. On Wednesday, the Center for Humanist Activism launched a political action committee, hoping to turn the tide. The Freethought Equality Fund PAC is being billed as the first non-theist PAC with a full-time paid staff. The group's organizers plan to provide financial support to humanist, atheist and agnostic candidates at all levels of government, and will support candidates who identify with a religion, so long as they are committed to protecting the separation of church and state and defending the civil liberties of secular Americans. At a press conference on Wednesday, Maggie Ardiente, Freethought's director of development and communications, explained why the group is concerned about a political system that has been monopolized by religious lawmakers. \"Whether we recognize it or not, Americans are held captive to the will of religious right leaders who remind us of our inferior position by using the power of government to enforce laws that put truth claims about religion in front of us at every turn,\" Ardiente said. \"We have to spend our tax dollars on schools in most states where educators refuse to teach that the evidence massively supports a theory of evolution that unites everything we know about biology.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Want a job that makes you ­irresistible? It may surprise you to hear that having an investment banker or firefighter title against your name, or even a CrossFit ­instructor’s, is no longer evidence yours is the most desirable ­profession. According to the Harvard Business Review, the sexiest profession of the 21st century is tipped to be data scientist. We employ a lot of data scientists at REA Group, and while they have many great ­attributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the future. Data scientists now hold the insight cards in their palms — not by reading planet alignments or palms or tea leaves, but by analysing and modelling the enormous amounts of data produced on our sites and combining it with other sources of information. If you’d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed If I want to know the projected residential price increase of Hoxton Park, the types of housing preferred by first-home buyers, or the configuration of a residential apartment that will get the most interest, our team can pull the data, develop statistical models and tell me the answers. As someone who holds a fascination for ­future trends, it’s hard not to be impressed. Recently, our data scientists have been looking at the probability of someone selling their home. Supply of housing, whether it is new dwellings or new listings, is often seen as simply a result of demand. Enough demand will push up prices and either prompt people to sell or allow developers to get a large enough margin to put up more housing. When listing a home, we know strong demand is not the only driver to sell, and a more complex analysis is required. The owner ultimately wants the best price possible, but other factors also ­feature, including a mix of market drivers and personal drivers. These can include the demographic of the household, sales activity in the street the house is in, and the rental yield the house achieves or could achieve. By looking at these drivers in isolation, it is hard to determine a market trend, but give a data scientist a computer, loads of data and a modelling package and chances are they can work it out. Right now we’re seeing high clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne, but this is not necessarily translating into new listings. Melbourne, in particular, had fewer auctions last week than it has had for a while, as owners of property appear to be holding off for a variety of reasons. While they have many great ­attributes, what makes them most irresistible is their ability to tell the future This could be because they ­believe they will get a better price in spring, or perhaps they are deciding to hold on to properties longer because they think there is still price growth in the market. In reality, the reasons are complex and show high variability across and within each capital city. If you’d asked me 15 years ago if the sexiest profession would have included the words \"data\" and \"scientist\" in the title, I probably would have laughed. But luckily we now have lots of irresistible data scientists to help us work it out and interpret the numbers, enabling us to continually supply better and more relevant information to both buyers and sellers.\n",

            "Paragraph: Oh my. I’ll never look at my Chinese leftovers in the same way again. At least I know where it goes, after it’s consumed. In China, however, there are literally tons of leftover sweet and sour pork, dumplings, spring rolls, won ton soup and moo goo gai pan. This bounty of leftover slop has been turned into a variety of other cash crops by Chinese restaurant owners who have perfected their recycling skills with an entrepreneurial flare. The Epoch Times reports: \"... North News in China’s Inner Mongolia region reported that of 200 to 300 tons of kitchen slop produced in the 3 million-strong city of Hohhot, only about 60 tons were being legally repurposed to produce aviation fuel. It is feared that the rest is reused in products that end up on dinner plates—in pork feed and cooking oil. Although Hohhot has a municipal environmental company that takes restaurant slop free of charge to be processed, many establishments have found it more profitable to sell the fetid wastewater and leftovers to local collectors and redistributors.\" I have an understanding of recycling, [because] a family member used to sell used automobile parts. We called him a dealer in secondary industrial raw materials. Radios, tires, transmissions, mufflers, car seats and any part someone wanted was available. That is, if they had their own wrench. But the idea of being a collector of \"fetid wastewater\" brings a new meaning to environmental dynamics. This mess of recycled pottage is also fed to the pigs and to humans who eat them \"According to North News, slop not given up to the state environmental companies may be resold to pig farms and used as cheap fodder, or reprocessed into common cooking oil for unsuspecting consumers. Leaving aside squeamishness at eating other people’s half-eaten leftovers, restaurant slop often contains non-food substances like kitchen detergent. Slop is also dangerous when used as pig fodder, as it contains significant traces of aluminum and lead, in addition to being laden with bacteria, the Henan Business daily reported. The pork itself also poses a risk.\" Some of this putrid mess is sold to private buyers – sounding vaguely familiar to Big Pharma’s vaccine concoctions The Epoch Times reports: \"‘It’s unknown how much of Hohhot’s kitchen slop is recycled in this manner, but the business is profitable, said Fu Ming, head of the municipal environmental company, in an interview with North News. Restaurants can make enough money to pay multiple employees with the food garbage,\" he said. \"‘On an everyday basis, there are a hundred vehicles used to transport slop,’ Fu said, ‘and because restaurants don’t adhere to environmental standards, it is sold to private buyers.'\" If this is what they do with the left over chicken and broccoli, what is done with leftover medical devices like syringes and medical waste? The Epoch Times did a story on that too: \"In China, disposable eating utensils, plastic wrap, bags and even synthetic fibers used in clothing can be produced from recycled materials—but those materials don’t come from the best of sources. \"Without proper regulation, syringes, infusion tubes and the like, often tainted with blood and drug residue, are retrieved in bulk and recycled for plastic products... as it may contain traces of infectious diseases, viruses and chemical or radiological pollutants. However, the business is profitable — 30,000 to 50,000 yuan (between $4,000 and $7,000) a month for a recycling station owner.\" From repurposing nuclear waste into depleted uranium, moo goo gai pan into putrid cooking oil, to used syringes morphed into plastic, it’s man’s worship of money that controls the trade.\n",

            "Paragraph: Harry Potter books and film series may be over, but J.K. Rowling‘s Wizarding World continues to live on. There are the short stories and essays published on Pottermore. There is the upcoming film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which explores this familiar universe in a different time and place. And then there is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the ambitious stage play sequel to the original series currently dominating the London theater scene that Warner Bros. says Thebooks and film series may be over, but‘s Wizarding World continues to live on. There are the short stories and essays published on Pottermore. There is the upcoming film, which explores this familiar universe in a different time and place. And then there is, the ambitious stage play sequel to the original series currently dominating the London theater scene that Warner Bros. says won’t get a film adaptation anytime soon (but go ahead and ask them again in ten years). So when someone asks film series star, Daniel Radcliffe, if he’d be willing to reprise his role as Harry Potter for a new movie, it’s all theoretical. But let’s face it – chances are strong you’re curious about what he says. It’s okay. You’re only human, and a Muggle at that. Radcliffe was in attendance at the Deauville Film Festival, where he was the recipient of the Rising Star Award, and The Hollywood Reporter asked him the big question. Would he say no to another Harry Potter movie down the line? His answer is diplomatic and the exact kind of response you’d expect from a young actor who has grown up carefully navigating the spotlight: I’m never going to close the door; that would be a stupid thing to do. But I think I’ll be happy enough and secure enough to let someone else play it. [...] At the moment it’s not even a concern because I’m too young to play the character, but even in 10 years’ time I would still feel strange about going back to it. [...] There’s a part of me that’s like, some things are better left untouched. If we went back to Potter, there’s a chance we’d make what Star Wars: The Force Awakens was to the original Star Wars, but there’s also the chance that we’d make Phantom Menace. So I don’t want to go back to anything like that and maybe sour what people have already loved. In other words, he’d do it as long as it doesn’t stink (a prospect easier said than done). He also adds that Jamie Parker, who plays the older Harry in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on stage, could easily play the character on film. I really liked reading the script for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ( and have written all about its similarities to Star Wars: The Force Awakens ) and think it’s teeming with cinematic potential. However, a quickly produced film adaptation leaves a lot of money on the table. It’s why you won’t see a Hamilton movie for a long, long time. As long as a stage play is still packing houses and generating demand, you don’t make a film version that lets everyone see it. That’s just basic business. Daniel Radcliffe isn’t taking the thought of another Potter movie seriously yet and neither should you. Besides, Radcliffe is quickly becoming one of our most brave and ambitious actors, playing magical corpses in movies like Swiss Army Man and neo-Nazis in Imperium. Let’s give him some space. Plus, a new Harry Potter movie starring the original cast would be far more satisfying if we wait another decade to let the actors properly age into their older selves.\n",

            "Paragraph: USULUTÁN, El Salvador — The threat came from inside a prison: Leave town or your body parts will be found inside trash bags. Idalia’s hand shook as she handed back the phone to the gang members her husband had hired to deliver her death sentence. On the other end of the line their boss had given her the ultimatum. She had come to expect violent outbursts from husband — he had beaten, raped, and choked her for the past 15 years — but involving a gang leader was a first. Idalia, who requested that her last name not be revealed for fear of reprisals, needed time to think about whether she would stay with her daughters or heed the warning and leave everything she shared with her husband behind. Days later, she lay in bed listening as the teenagers who’d delivered the message returned, stomping on the roof, reminding her that time was running out. \"I’m still terrified to ask for help,\" she said, nearly a year after the episode, putting her arm out to show how it was covered in goosebumps.   \"Men continue thinking they own women.\" ID: 8792598 When Idalia, 37, decided she would defy his orders, her husband hired a hitman to kill her. Luckily for her, the assassin was himself thrown in jail before he could carry out the hit. Desperate to find out what was going on, Idalia went to visit her would-be killer in prison and found out how much her husband had paid to get rid of her. \"$10,000. That’s it,\" she said in disbelief, crying quietly. In El Salvador, where warring gangs have unleashed an unprecedented bloodbath, turning it into the country with the highest murder rate in the world, women’s lives are almost worthless. \"Men continue thinking they own women,\" said Alba Evelyn Cortez, a consultant on gender issues at El Salvador’s legislative assembly. It is, frankly, terrifying to be a woman in El Salvador. The staunchly Catholic country of six million on the Pacific coast of the Central American isthmus is one of the most machista and patriarchal in the region. Systematically beaten, raped, and killed in a country that has rarely held their aggressors accountable, women have become even more vulnerable since a government-brokered truce between the country’s two main gangs collapsed in 2014, experts and activists say. In 2012, when the truce was signed, homicides dropped by 60% from the previous year, but last year they shot up past pre-truce levels: There were 6,653 homicides — an average of 18 per week, or 115 for every 100,000 people. This violence has spilled from the street into people’s homes. \"Gang members are at the center of families,\" said Silvia Juárez, of the Organization of Salvadoran Women for Peace, or ORMUSA, a nonprofit. \"The violence that women in El Salvador face is more lethal now.\" Femicides, or the killing of women because of their gender, have been on the rise in recent years. In 2014, there were 183 cases of femicide, up from 98 the previous year, though the numbers are believed to be significantly underreported. But it’s not just femicides: The rate at which women are being killed is rising faster than men. Last year, women made up 8.6% of all homicides, up from 7.5% the previous year, according to the Femicides, or the killing of women because of their gender, have been on the rise in recent years. In 2014, there were 183 cases of femicide, up from 98 the previous year, though the numbers are believed to be significantly underreported. But it’s not just femicides: The rate at which women are being killed is rising faster than men. Last year, women made up 8.6% of all homicides, up from 7.5% the previous year, according to the Institute of Legal Medicine Despite this, there are few resources available for women who suffer domestic violence. The Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, a government agency, has just one overnight shelter for victims of domestic violence, making it impossible for most women to reach. In recent years, however, a glimmer of hope has emerged in the figure of the former first lady, Vanda Pignato. She has led a campaign to bring women’s rights into the mainstream, and has built six centers — known as Ciudad Mujer (or Women’s City) — around the country, offering women a place where they can seek help. And most importantly, they can do so anonymously — essential in a country where speaking out against your male abusers can be fatal. View this image › Idalia at one of the Ciudad Mujer sites. Karla Zabludovsky / BuzzFeed News ID: 8782053 It was 2014 and everyone in Idalia’s neighborhood in the southern city of Usulután could tell she was barely surviving. One day, one of her neighbors, a state employee, pulled Idalia aside and told her about Ciudad Mujer, where women can do everything from seeking treatment for abuse-related injuries and getting small-business loans to attending talks about eating disorders or taking software development classes. In a country where the cards are stacked against women, Ciudad Mujer saved Idalia’s life. \"I was beyond destroyed when I first came here,\" she said, nervously pushing her hair behind her ears at a conference room in a Ciudad Mujer center. Shortly after she first went there, Idalia started seeing a psychologist, who convinced her to divorce her abusive husband. Ciudad Mujer employees helped her develop a life plan shortly after, advising her on how to set up a business, get her house back, and teach her daughters about their rights. Women’s rights advocates contend that Ciudad Mujer forced the state to make an investment in women for the first time in the country’s history. \"It marks a before and after,\" said Juárez, of ORMUSA. Other Latin-American countries like Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and Bolivia, where violence against women is also rampant, are planning to build their own Ciudad Mujer outposts. A visit with Pignato to one of her Ciudad Mujer centers revealed how important they are to the former first lady, who is almost missionary in her desire to protect women. Sitting cross-legged and barefoot in an SUV on the way to a center 45 minutes away from the capital city, San Salvador, she said that living in her husband’s shadow during the presidential campaign of 2009 — no longer Vanda but \"the candidate’s wife\" — sparked her desire to bring Salvadoran women to the foreground. \"Ciudad Mujer is born out of my indignation at being forced to become invisible. I decided to look at the invisibles, like myself,\" said the Brazilian-born lawyer who supported the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua and the guerrilla groups during El Salvador’s civil war in the 1980s. Pignato, who cut off her shoulder-length hair last year while undergoing treatment for cervical cancer, flashed a broad smile while walking through Ciudad Mujer. She embraced visitors and told them she loved them; some wanted selfies with her. Pignato asked after a middle-aged woman who she knew had had a mammogram a week earlier and congratulated another woman holding a months-old baby, caressing its face. Everything at the center is designed to educate girls and women about their rights: the coloring books at the daycare center contain illustrations of angry-looking men, below the caption: \"The right to be protected from abuse\"; the table mats at the cafeteria explain the Comprehensive Law for a Violence-Free Life for Women, passed in 2011. The hallways connecting the various brick buildings were flanked by healthy, well-tended lawns. Even though each Ciudad Mujer site is visited by as many as 240 women every day, the public spaces were impeccably clean and tidy. They were quiet except for the chirping of birds and the low hum of conversation. Pignato noted that the peaceful atmosphere is not accidental, explaining that said she envisioned the project not just as a safe refuge for women but as a place where they could regain their dignity, a sliver of peace, and a sense of self-worth. A group of straw-hatted women walked around a vegetable garden behind the center, immersed in one of the courses meant to give women financial independence. In order to participate in these, women must agree to share their newly acquired skills with six other women. Pignato noted that they were wearing regular shoes because women’s-size rubber boots don’t exist in the country — a sign of the reigning machista attitude. \"This government doesn’t understand that in order to combat violence it needs to attack gender violence,\" said Pignato. Combatting gender violence, said Pignato, starts at home. Her personal starting point? Teaching her 8-year-old son to cook, an activity generally reserved for women. Pignato was engaging and excitable with the staff but admitted that the last two years had been exhausting, not least as she is still recovering from her treatment. (She was briefly hospitalized a week earlier after fainting during a visit to a center.) Her personal life became tabloid fodder when her husband, former president Mauricio Funes, had a very public affair with another woman during his last year in office. At the time, she stayed with Funes until his term ended because, she said, leaving him would have destabilized the electoral process and possibly led to the defeat of his left-wing party. But now that she has separated from him, she tirelessly devotes herself to women’s rights. View this image › Vanda Pignato Karla Zabludovksy / BuzzFeed News ID: 8782061 Idalia doesn’t live far from the Ciudad Mujer site in Usulután, but getting there is a tedious process: She weaves her way around the stalls in a nearby market, curling her back to make herself a few inches shorter, all the while looking over her shoulder. It’s a precautionary measure in case her former husband has hired someone to report on her whereabouts. It’s a valid concern: Late last year, after she had begun visiting Ciudad Mujer, Idalia received a call from him. By then, he had taken all of her savings, kicked her out of the family business, and moved his new girlfriend into their home. Her husband’s viperous voice floated through the receiver. \"In this life, the smartest one wins. And you are a fool.\" While women are safe inside Ciudad Mujer, getting there is unnerving for many. The merest suspicion that a woman is going to snitch on a gang member is enough to put her life at risk. And despite the good intentions, women remain vulnerable. \"The state, once again, arrived too late,\" said Juárez, from ORMUSA. Impunity reigns, too. Less than 10% of homicide cases in 2015 ever saw the inside of a courtroom, according to Impunity reigns, too. Less than 10% of homicide cases in 2015 ever saw the inside of a courtroom, according to El Faro , an online investigative newspaper. In cases involving women, this trend is often exacerbated. \"The justice system is still very saturated with a paternal vision where the man has hierarchy over the bodies and lives of women,\" said Cortez. But Ciudad Mujer is constantly evolving. Several of its locations have begun offering services tailored for minors, who bear the brunt of intra-family violence, including rape. But it has plenty of room for improvement, activists say. One pressing thing is to keep the centers open at night, on weekends, and during holidays, when women are more likely to get attacked. As of now, they close at 3 p.m. during the week (although a police officer stays on the grounds and can respond to a call, but victims cannot get medical or legal support). Another step would be to start keeping comprehensive records of how many women visit Ciudad Mujer because they have been abused or attacked, so that the state can make informed public policies. For now, Ciudad Mujer is virtually the only hope for thousands of women whose homes have become a minefield. Last month, for the first time in Ciudad Mujer’s history, a baby was born on one of the six locations. With the child’s first cries still ringing in the air, a shocked-looking Pignato walked into the Sexual Health building — past the rape victims’ waiting room — just as the nurse was placing the newborn in her mother’s arms. As Pignato made her way back through the center, she looked pensive: \"On one side, the happiness of a baby, on the other, the sadness of a violation.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: The subway is a germaphobe’s nightmare: the steep stairs that dare you not to hold the handrail, the ticket-vending touchscreen tacky with fingerprints, the smush of people packed together, all with questionable levels of hygiene. This must mean that subway cars are just as packed with microbes . But should we be worried? A group of researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health wanted to find out, so they took a bunch of trips on the Boston city subway and started swabbing. In their new study published in the American Society for Microbiology’s journal mSystems , the scientists report on what they found when they sampled the seats, seat backs, walls, poles, ticketing machines and hanging straps on the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. They were amazed at how much the city subway looks, microbially speaking, like a mosaic of humans. The most dominant bacteria on all of the surfaces were from people's skin and mouths. And the kinds of colonies that thrived in certain places, like hanging grips, depended on how that surface is used: the scientists found enriched colonies of breathing-borne bacteria on touchscreens and vaginal bacteria on fuzzy polyester seats. Happily, though, the scientists didn’t find pathogenic organisms that typically cause sickness or antibiotic-resistant genes. \"I was surprised by the degree to which these environments really do look like people,\" says senior author Curtis Huttenhower, associate professor of computational biology and bioinformatics. \"But if you think about the relative size of a bacteria compared to how porous clothing is, it’s no surprise that we’re shedding all sorts of bugs.\" In the future, this kind of technology might be helpful to monitor the microbes in different environments, like a subway, an airport or a kindergarten classroom. If the colonies started to shift from their normal state, that could signal the start of flu season or an early outbreak of norovirus, for example, and officials would get an early cue that it’s time to step up interventions like handwashing. So ditch the tissue when you hold the train pole. Riding the subway, Huttenhower says, is just like shaking a bunch of people’s hands.\n",

            "Paragraph: It was supposed to be an expression of solidarity. And it was — for some. As protests over the fatal police shootings of black men raged in Charlotte and elsewhere last week, students at the University of Vermont hoisted a Black Lives Matter flag at the center of campus, right next to, and at the same height, as the state flag and the American flag. The university and the Student Government Association sanctioned the display, saying it was designed to show support for those \"struggling with the violence and search for justice in this country.\" Sophomore Akilah Ho-Young could hardly contain her excitement. \"I wanted to cry when I saw this,\" Ho-Young said in a Sept. 22 Facebook post that included a picture of the Black Lives Matter flag flying outside the student center, alongside the American and state flags. \"My body filled with lots of joy to know that my predominantly white university is paying tribute to the deaths in the black community,\" she said. \"It’s the littlest thing that just means so much to me!\" The post went viral. The popular social justice writer Shaun King shared it, along with more than 14,000 others. Comments and tweets poured in from supporters who called it a brave display.

Student leaders say it was stolen, and the university is investigating it as a theft. The episode underscored the extent to which a movement and a symbol have come to stand for radically different things to different people. And it illustrates how the debate over race relations and policing in America has penetrated the land, after a summer punctuated by several high-profile officer-involved shootings of black men, the assassination of six police officers by a black gunman in Dallas, and the mass demonstrations that have followed in cities around the country. The phrase Black Lives Matter first received national attention in summer 2014 and, since then, has become part of conversations on race in America. Here's how the phrase became a movement. (Claritza Jimenez,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) [Black Dallas police officer sues Black Lives Matter on behalf of ‘Christians, Jews and Caucasians,’ others] The flag controversy in Vermont played out against a backdrop of protests, some of them violent, over the fatal police shootings of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa. When news about the flag spread, some critics immediately cited the demonstrations in Charlotte — where a civilian reportedly shot and killed a protester and some demonstrators destroyed property — as evidence that Black Lives Matter promoted violence and was itself a racist movement, although no connection between that shooting and the BLM movement has been alleged. \"This is why I’m ashamed to have gone to this school. This organization has proved time and time again they are a racist hate group,\" said Chris Dietze,whose Facebook page indicates he graduated from UVM in 2013. \"If they really cared about police brutality they’d be mad when someone of any color gets shot and killed by police who were unarmed.\" Some students appeared to share that view. \"Not at all surprised that UVM would condone this racist organization which promotes the murder of white people and police officers,\" read a comment on the UVM Instagram account from Chris Kaufman, whose profile says he is a student from the class of 2018. \"If only people were as outraged at the number of blacks killing other blacks each and every day.\" [Why SPLC says White Lives Matter is a hate group but Black Lives Matter is not] Other commenters said the university should never have stepped into the fray. \"Schools and universities should remain politically free,\" David Proemsy wrote on Facebook. \"Universities should nurture all political views and expression. This appears to be oppressive to students with other viewpoints.\" The flagpole at the student center has historically flown flags that represent different groups on campus and allows university organizations to sponsor similar displays, university officials told NBC 5. Helen Driesen, a 19-year-old political science major at the university, said she was coming home from a party early Sunday morning when she noticed the bare pole in front of the student center. She said she’d seen posts on social media from people in town, but not necessarily students, calling for the flag to be taken down. \"I was angry but I’m honestly not surprised,\" Driesen told The Washington Post. \"People have all kinds of misconceptions about this movement. They don’t understand the gravity of it and how extremely overdue it is.\" Student Government Association President Jason Maulucci said he never expected such an intense backlash. In an interview with The Post, Maulucci said university administrators had approved the proposal to raise the Black Lives Matter flag without issue. At first, Maulucci said, the response was \"overwhelmingly positive.\" But as the display gained national attention, Maulucci said he started getting hate mail and threats from strangers online. Then, at some point late Saturday or early Sunday, someone took the flag down. A picture of the crank on the flagpole suggested someone had pried it open, lowered the flag and stolen it, Maulucci said. \"When the #BlackLivesMatter flag was stolen last night, #UVM Student Life Director and his wife painted a new one and replaced it.\" pic.twitter.com/lqJGrAHO98 — Chris Campbell (@ChrisCampbel_) September 25, 2016 By Sunday afternoon, however, a new flag had been hoisted in its place, sewn together by Pat Brown, the university’s director of student life, according to Maulucci. \"It was upsetting that someone stole it, but I think it underscored the necessity for raising in the first place,\" Maulucci said. \"We’re proud of the fact that we’re contributing to that conversation. You can’t make progress unless you acknowledge that there’s a problem.\" It was not the first, and will not be the last, conflict of its kind. [This attorney wore a Black Lives Matter pin to court — and went to jail for it] In July, a police officer in Detroit was demoted for a post critical of Black Lives Matter. The same month, an Ohio judge ordered an attorney jailed for five hours for wearing a Black Lives Matter pin to court. And in May, a controversy erupted at Dartmouth University after a group of students removed a \"Blue Lives Matter\" display and replaced it with Black Lives Matter posters. In May, conservative commentators joined a chorus of critics demanding a hate group designation for Black Lives Matter from the Southern Poverty Law Center, claiming that in the wake of the shootings of police officers in Dallas, its rhetoric was inflammatory. The SPLC, which tracks hate groups, refused, explaining itself in a long post by SPLC president Richard Cohen: There’s no doubt that some protesters who claim the mantle of Black Lives Matter have said offensive things, like the chant ‘pigs in a blanket, fry ’em like bacon’ that was heard at one rally. But before we condemn the entire movement for the words of a few, we should ask ourselves whether we would also condemn the entire Republican Party for the racist words of its presumptive nominee — or for the racist rhetoric of many other politicians in the party over the course of years. Student activists are set to host a rally Monday at 4:30 outside the student center, where they plan to dress entirely in black and gather for a picture around the new flag, according to a Facebook event. The event had more than 500 guests as of Monday morning. Organizers — among them Ho-Young, whose Facebook post went viral — stressed that the event was not a protest but a peaceful demonstration to \"celebrate the black community and their alliances.\" \"The flags being placed on the same level represents what this nation and institution was built on,\" the event’s organizers said. \"Equality for all people.\"\n",

            "Topic: What It Feels Like to Die\n",
            "Paragraph: \"Do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down?\" My mother and I sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents’ Colorado home. It was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. A month or two earlier, she’d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to Australia with my father. Now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. My mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor’s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. Still, we weren’t prepared for the nurse’s question. My mother and I exchanged glances, a little shocked. But what we felt most was a sense of relief. During six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics—not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died. There’s good reason. \"Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing,\" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the ‘event horizon,’ apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying—the last few days or moments—remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control’s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. \"Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\" For those who do die gradually, there’s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life—a phase known as \"active dying.\" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. \"First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.\" Whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. \"There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,\" Campbell says. \"There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there’s no distress.\" Having a disease associated with pain doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes—and the medicine usually works. \"If they’re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,\" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that’s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon—which is commonly called a death rattle—probably doesn’t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it’s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. \"We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you’re not really responsive, that your perception—how you feel about things—may also be significantly decreased,\" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. \"You may or may not even be aware of what’s happening.\" * * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, \"the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,\" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills—and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. \"The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea.\" \"As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,\" Hovda explains. \"And so that’s where people begin to see light.\" Recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain’s response to dying. Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. \"A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,\" she says. \"They see lights and then they describe the experience as ‘realer than real.’\" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. \"Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,\" she says. The rats’ brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence—the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. \"If you’re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face—when you’re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,\" Borjigin says. \"These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. So, we thought, if you’re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. In fact, that was the case.\" * * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother’s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. Once, I captured her hands in mine and asked what she’d been doing. \"Putting things away,\" she answered, smiling dreamily. This half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people’s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The \"patients’ pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. Twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. (Patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) For most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive. The researchers say the dreams often helped decrease the fear of death. \"The predominant quality of pre-death dreams/visions was a sense of personal meaning, which frequently carried emotional significance for the patient,\" they report.\n",

            "Paragraph: IHOP receipt. (Photo: KVUE) AUSTIN - An Austin couple who stopped to pick up a meal at an IHOP restaurant early Monday said they will never go to another IHOP after the message they saw on their receipt. Arainia Brown and her boyfriend Rolman Sparkman were traveling back to Austin and decided to grab a to-go order from the IHOP at I-35 and Cesar Chavez around 3 a.m. Monday. When Brown saw her receipt, she immediately became upset. \"This is not a joke,\" said Sparkman. \"It's very serious and it hurt a lot of people's feelings.\" Brown and Sparkmen were shocked to see \"BLACK PPL\" typed at the top of their receipt. Two words that induced a range of emotions. \"I feel upset, I'm sad, I'm angry. Like this, it makes no sense,\" said Brown.

            "Paragraph: There is a phrase in our vocabulary that nobody has to teach us to say. It’s a phrase kids learn very quickly in childhood. And it’s a phrase you should ban in your household: \"That’s not fair.\" It sounds innocent enough. Everybody wants life to be fair, right? But this is an insidious phrase, revealing a sin so bankrupt it goes back to the very beginning, back to the Fall of Man. It’s essentially what Eve was told by the serpent. \"You’re getting a raw deal. You’re entitled to more. God is holding out on you.\" If you read Paul’s account of the Fall in Romans, you’ll discover that it was this attitude—ingratitude and entitlement—that lit the match of sin, plunging Creation into darkness. And it’s a surefire way to test your own heart, to see where the idols are. Maybe it seems a bit melodramatic to bring all of this up to my four children, ages 2, 4, 5, and 9. But I fear that if I allow them to embed entitlement in their little hearts right now, their first reaction to someone else getting an extra dessert, a gift from a friend, a new pair of shoes, is \"That’s not fair.\" And so we don’t allow this in our home. And when it comes up, my kids know they are in for some form of punishment, which usually involves a long-winded soliloquy from Dad that goes something like this: First, you are right in saying that life isn’t fair. Because it’s not fair that little children go to bed hungry this very night, having eaten nothing but a handful of rice and here you’ve just had seconds on french fries. It’s not fair that some boys and girls grow up without a mother and father, orphaned by a war they didn’t start. It’s not fair that some children won’t even see many birthdays, succumbing to diseases we treat with immunizations and routine trips to the doctor. So if there is a complaining about being fair, it’s you and me and all of us in prosperous, free America on the other side of \"Not fair.\" So in the line of people complaining about a bad lot in life, we are several zip codes away from the front. Most of the world is pointing to us and saying, \"Life isn’t fair\" and they have a much better case.\n",

Countless studies have attempted to show exactly how much is needed for optimum health, and some people have even gone on as little as Countless studies have attempted to show exactly how much is needed for optimum health, and some people have even gone on as little as three hours of sleep a night. A recent study by VU University Medical Centre in the A recent study by VU University Medical Centre in the Netherlands looked at the relationship between sleep duration, insulin sensitivity and the potential onset of diabetes and heart disease. The results found that seven hours spent in deep sleep is the perfect amount to maintain reasonable insulin production and glucose levels. This means that the amount of time spent in bed is probably more than seven hours - more like seven and a half. Sleeping less than seven hours has been proven to disrupt glucose metabolism in men and women. A stable glucose level contributes to weight control, and if it is disrupted, could lead to weight gain, and the early onset of diabetes. So how do Britons fare? The Royal Society of Public Health issued a The Royal Society of Public Health issued a report earlier this year which found that people in the UK get an average of 6.8 hours of sleep a night.

            "Paragraph: Kissing can be many things: sweet, loving, intense, passionate. But did you know it could also benefit your health? Kissing can also be a hormone releaser, a mini-workout and a mood relaxer. Scientists have proven that smooching can trigger a whole spectrum of physiological processes to boost your immunity and improve your connection with your partner. We take you through each one and explain just how beneficial a lip lock can be. 1. IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH According to dentist Dr Heidi Hausauer, kissing increases saliva flow. This in turn keeps the mouth, teeth and gums healthy by removing food particles. The extra saliva helps to wash bacteria off the teeth and reduce plaque buildup. Some experts even claims that the mineral ions in saliva can promote repair of small lesions in tooth enamel. 2. GIVES IMMUNE SYSTEM A BOOST  Just as saliva can help oral hygiene, it can also give your immune system a boost.  There are more than 700 types of bacteria inside a human mouth - with no two alike.  Therefore, exchanging saliva can introduce the body to new bacteria. Studies have shown that having a diverse amount of bacteria in our bodies correlates with better health - specifically when it comes to our microbiota, or the collection of microorganisms living inside us. A 2014 Dutch study found that a 10-second French kiss can exchange up to 80 million bacteria between us and our partner. And while a single kiss isn't enough to change a person's microbiota, the researchers found that couples who kissed longer had similar microbiota, meaning that they would be better prepared to fight off similar infections and digest similar foods. 3. LOWERS ANXIETY Kissing has been shown to decrease the stress hormone cortisol and increase serotonin - a chemical responsible for maintaining mood balance - levels in the brain.  It has also been shown to have similar benefits to meditation, mainly from its ability to release oxytocin, also known as the 'love' hormone. Oxytocin can act like a psychological buffer and induces a sense of calm and bonding in humans. Experts say we experience a surge of the hormone during orgasm but kind words or a gentle touch can also drive oxytocin levels up. This enhances the experience of what we identify as love and trust. 4. LESSENS ALLERGIC REACTIONS  Dr Hajime Kimata, who specializes in allergology at a clinic in Japan, won an Ig Nobel Prize for revealing how 30 minutes of kissing can reduce the effect of allergic reactions. In 2006, his team studied 24 patients with two types of allergies: mild atopic eczema (a skin allergy) and mild allergic rhinitis (a nasal allergy). The patients were looked at before and after kissing their partners for 30 minutes while listening to soft music. Specifically, they smooched along to Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On with the belief that the soft ballad would set a romantic mood. The researchers found that kissing reduced the body's production of IgE, which is the body's way of reacting to an allergen.  5. LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE Because our lips are made up of blood vessels, kissing can lower blood pressure by dilating them and therefore allowing blood to flow to the vital organs. Plastic surgeon Dr Ryan Neinstein told Glamour: 'The blood is then directed toward the face and away from the rest of the body so the demand on the heart goes down, resulting in lower blood pressure.' As explained above, kissing lowers cortisol levels, which not only lowers anxiety, but also blood pressure. 6. DELAYS SIGNS OF AGING Because kissing increases blood flow to the face, it stimulates the production of collagen - an abundant and important protein found in our bodies, according to Dr Neinstein.  'In order to move your lips, your whole face has to get involved, which increases elasticity,' he said. 'Have you seen face yoga, or facercises? There are yogis, estheticians and dermatologists training women to do exercises for their face to stimulate collagen and reduce the need for a face lift.  'Passionate kissing can lead to firming the face, especially the bottom half of the face.' 7. BURNS CALORIES Depending on which study you look at, kissing can burn anywhere between two and six calories per minute. However, kissing with tongue - which uses all the muscles in your face - can burn up to 26 calories per minute. Andréa Demirjian, author of Kissing: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about One of Life's Sweetest Pleasures, told CNN it wouldn't compare to a workout session at the gym, but it would still do its job. 'Kissing and lovemaking can be a vigorous exercise if you're fully engaged.You need to have a passionate kiss [in order to burn those calories], but it doesn't have to be a 10-hour makeout session,' she said. Researchers also say we use 30 muscles while kissing, which helps keep your cheeks tight. 8. INCREASES SEX DRIVE Kissing prompts your brain to release a happy elixir of feel-good chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin.  Additionally, testosterone - the hormone responsible for sex drive in both women and men - is released into saliva during prolonged kissing.  'Male saliva has trace amounts of testosterone - and testosterone is an aphrodisiac,' Gallup says. 'So passing saliva during open-mouth kissing over extended periods might help raise her testosterone levels and affect her sex drive,' Dr Gordon Gallup, a psychologist at the University at Albany, told Men's Health. \n",

            "Topic: Here's The Real Reason Your Friend's 'Gluten-Free' Diet Might Be Making Them Feel Better\n",
            "Paragraph: As more and more of your friends go gluten-free, you may be wondering: Is there something to this latest diet craze? Is gluten-intolerance a thing? Is it getting more common? The answer is simply no. Only about 1% of Americans actually have celiac disease, the rare genetic disorder that makes people intolerant to gluten, and that number is not on the rise. In other words, in a room of 100 people, chances are one has celiac. In fact, a study published this month found that the prevalence of celiac has remained basically unchanged since 2009. And as for all those people who say they don't have celiac but are just \"sensitive\" to gluten, a 2013 study out of Monash University suggested that this probably isn't real. Alan Levinovitz, an assistant professor at James Madison University who studies the intersection between religion and medicine and the author of the book \"The Gluten Lie,\" says it essentially comes down to a mix of psychology and behavioral change. In the book, Levinovitz interviews Monash University director of gastroenterology Peter Gibson, who helped write the 2013 study concluding that non-celiac gluten \"intolerance\" was probably not a thing. Gibson says the real reason that many people who have cut gluten claim to feel healthier afterwards is simply because they've changed their diet. \"I've noticed [this] lots of times, even with family members,\" Gibson tells Levinovitz. \"They've decided they're eating a lot of takeaway foods, quick foods, not eating well at all. They read this thing about gluten-free, and then they're buying fresh vegetables, cooking well, and eating a lot better.\" In other words, while cutting gluten may seem like it helps you lose weight or clears up your complexion, the reality is that 500 other things could be the real cause. \"Blaming the gluten is easy, but you could point to about a hundred things they're doing better,\" Gibson adds. But this can be a tough pill to swallow. \"When it comes to food sensitivities, people are incredibly unwilling to question self-diagnoses,\" Levinovitz writes. \"No one wants to think that the benefits they experienced from going gluten-free ... might be psychological.\" On top of that, connecting what we've eaten to physical symptoms is incredibly difficult. Not only have studies shown that we have trouble remembering what we ate when we ate it, we're also poor judges of what's healthy and what's not. So rather than jumping to self-diagnose, see a doctor. And stick to the science.\n",

            "Paragraph: A recent and deeply-sinister guide for men on how to talk to women wearing headphones has outraged many. Here’s a more honest and accurate guide An article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is The Internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. Written as dating advice for \"The Modern Man\" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot ‘n’ horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn’t a parody. You can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It’s going to be quite a ride. How to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones \"These days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time. Yet, that doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them. Of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking. However, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her.\" The author, one Dan Bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his \"How to\" with \"Don’t\". Sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here you see, the very reason I and many other women wear headphones isn’t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. It’s a defence. A defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. In short, we wear them because we don’t want to be talked to. It’s basic physics really - we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in. But back to Dan: What to Do to Get Her Attention 1. Stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you). 2. Have a relaxed, easy-going smile. 3. Is she hasn’t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can’t ignore it. 4. When she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, \"Take off your headphones for a minute\" and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands. If she doesn’t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, \"I want to talk to you for a minute.\" In most cases, you won’t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening. 5. Then, do what we call \"Acknowledging the Awkwardness\" by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn’t the most common of experiences for either party. This helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to. I don’t know if these five steps are a common \"thing\", but I have personally experienced this several times. At step 1 I know what you are doing and I’m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere Hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. By step 3 I’m not feeling \"excited\" and I’m not feeling \"flattered\" as Dan later tells his readers I will be - I’m feeling harassed. Straight up, dictionary definition harassed. By step 4 I’ve learnt that you can’t understand a basic body language brush-off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. My brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it’s trying to figure out just how aggressively you’re going to react to any further action I take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time. According to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a \"cool guy\". Mr Bacon clearly has trouble spelling. It begins with a ‘t’, Dan. Here’s Dan’s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point Jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security: You: [Smile in a friendly, confident manner] Hey – I know it’s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but I was walking along and saw you and thought – wow, she’s a cutie, I have to say hi. I’m Dan, what’s your name? Woman: [Usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] Jessica. You: [Add in some humor] Cool...nice to meet you Jessica. I don’t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me. Woman: [Most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction]. You: [Let her know that you have something to do/somewhere to go, so she understands that you’re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] Anyway, so I’m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. I’m on my way to a store up the street. How’s your day going so far? In his scenario, Jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling. Here’s how it plays out in real life. Trust me, I’ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors: Him: I see you don’t want to be talked to but I find you physically attractive and I’m making that your problem. Her: Please leave me alone. Him: F*** YOU, YOU STUCK UP B****, I DIDN’T FANCY YOU ANYWAY. With \"advice\" like this out there, it’s hardly any surprise, is it? These lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. So imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn’t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook. Next Dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. Sadly not one of them is to sod right off. Points 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3. 2. Allowing her to ignore him \"Headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world. That being said, if a guy wants to get a woman’s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him. If a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won’t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones. Women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy’s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner? This is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her. If a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.\" 3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction \"No matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn’t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to. Controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. In other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine.\" The advice here is basically \"No doesn’t mean no, it means keep going until you get what you want - the screaming will stop eventually\". Because apparently that’s what women want - and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases. Trust me, when we tell you to go away we aren’t testing your measure as a man, we’re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction. Put Dan’s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw-drop factor: \"Shopkeepers may lock their doors at night, but if you want a pint of milk, just hammer on the door until they open up. They’ll be flattered.\" I appreciate the world of mating is hard but please, for the love of humanity, learn this: just because you want, doesn’t mean you can have. Women are not commodities to be hunted and won, and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with, that’s your problem, not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules. It’s a playbook we never signed up for and it’s only a game if both teams actually know they’re playing. Nowhere in his advice does Dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it. This attitude is why I and countless other women have been been chased down the street, followed home, physically restrained, spat at, verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage, merely for trying to exist. So when, I hear the whiny pissbabies ask, when am I allowed to approach hot single women? Simple. If a woman has her headphones in, the answer is never - and before you bleat on about \"ooh, what if there’s a fire?\", she’ll smell it, even through all your bulls**t. If you’re in a bar or party, her flirtatious smile may be the come-on you’re looking for, but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong, politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing, insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini. But how about this take up a hobby, ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or (brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation) if you’re looking for a horde of single, eligible women all looking for friendship-maybe-more in one convenient place, try a dating site. Anyway, coming soon from Dan Bacon, ‘How To Talk To A Woman Through A Fog Of Pepper Spray’. Probably.\n",

            "Paragraph: Looking out the window of a plane – with many hours to burn and a god-like perspective of the world – can get you pondering some of life’s big questions: Are we alone in the universe? How did it all begin? Is there purpose to our existence? Wait, what are those little holes in airplane windows? Thanks to the curious mind of Robbie Gonzalez from io9 , the latter of those questions might be answered. After finding no sturdy answer on internet forums, he decided to track down a copy of a maintenance manual for the Boeing 737 on Wikileaks and contact Marlowe Moncur, Director of Technology for GKN Aerospace, the world leader in passenger cabin window design development. As you might have already guessed, it’s to do with regulating pressure. He found that most cabin windows consist of outer, middle and inner panes – all of which are made of a superstrong synthetic resin. Typically, it’s the middle pane that has the mysterious little hole. Only the outer and middle panes are actually structural, while the inner is pretty much there as failsafe and to protect the other layers. Moncur said it’s only there to maintain cabin pressure in the extremely rare event that the outer pane becomes fractured. Cruising at 10,600 meters (35,000 feet), the pressure is around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) per square inch. This is too low for the human body to stay conscious, so the pressure is artificially maintained at around 3.5 kilograms (8 pounds) per square inch. But of course, if you increase pressure inside, the structure has to be strong to hold the difference between the external pressure and internal pressure. The outer pane is the thickest of these and is the primary layer that bears the pressure of the cabin. According to Gonzalez, the little hole is there to act as \"as a bleed valve, allowing pressure between the air in the passenger cabin and the air between the outer and middle panes to equilibrate.\" Simply put, it ensures that only the strongest outer pane is bearing the pressure, leaving the middle pane available in case of an emergency. Phew, now that problem’s solved, go work on creating lasting nuclear fusion . Main image credit: Chris Waits/Flickr. (CC BY 2.0)\n",

            "Paragraph: A Cameroonian attorney says that one of his clients was convicted of \"feminine mannerisms\" for drinking Bailey's Irish Cream under his country's strict anti-gay laws. Attorney Michel Togue, who has defended many Cameroon residents who have been accused of homosexuality, tells ThinkProgress that very few of his clients were ever caught engaging in an actual same-sex act, as local police have made arrests based solely on how the individual is presented if an accusation has been made. If a man is employed as a hairdresser, he said, or found to be cross-dressing, those attributes could be used as evidence that the suspect is gay in a court of law. \"To catch people having sex, to catch them in the act, you have to break the law. You have to violate their privacy, which is an offense,\" he told the publication. \"But the police will not focus on the offense of breaking the privacy of someone, but they will focus on the fact that they saw two people of the same gender having sex.\" Meanwhile, Togue explained that the nation's anti-gay laws were impacting HIV/AIDS outreach, as many patients \"can’t go to the hospital for the treatment or even for a test because they’re afraid.\" Last year, Human Rights Watch said that at least 28 people had been charged under Cameroon's anti-gay laws in the past three years, more than any other African nation. Later in 2013, Joseph Omgbwa, 48, and 19-year-old Nicolas Ntamack were sentenced to prison terms under Cameroon's anti-gay laws, according to the Associated Press. A third suspect, Seraphin Ntsama, was acquitted. Meanwhile, Roger Jean-Claude Mbede, who was declared a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International, died in January, the AP reported. Mbede, 34, had been jailed for sending a text message to another man, saying, \"I'm very much in love with you.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: These Two Hated Features are part of Battlefield 1 Battlefield 1’s official trailer has been getting rave reviews both from the gaming community and industry experts in general. Not only have the reveal trailer become the most viewed trailer on Youtube, but it also crushed its competitor Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’s trailer, both in terms of reception and amount of views. However, one should not forget that the Battlefield franchise is being published by EA, who isn’t really a fan-favorite either. And now, the company has sneakily confirmed that both micro-transactions and map packs would be part of Battlefield 1. This information was revealed by EA’s CEO Andrew Wilson during a investor call last week. Although Wilson used some rather generous marketing speak to confirm the same, it doesn’t help taking away from the fact that most gamers despise this model. Also read: Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare trailer is now the second most hated video on Youtube Wilson first said how EA plans to make big bucks by cleverly utilizing ‘extra monetization opportunities’ without making the game feel like a ‘pay-to-win’ model: As relates to Battlefield 1 and extra monetization opportunity,\" CEO Andrew Wilson says, \"taking a step back, any time we think about extra monetization inside an experience, we really think about it on two vectors: One, are we able to provide value to the gamer, in terms of extending and enhancing their experience? And two, are we able to do that in a world where we give them choice? We never want to be in a place where there’s a belief that we are providing a pay to win mechanic inside of one of our games. He then went on to say how the company is looking poised to utilize both macro transactions and micro transactions in Battlefield 1 to offer a more ‘enhanced’ experience to players. Basically, fancy words for map packs (macro) and in-game items unlocked by paying real cash (micro). Given that in Battlefield 1, you will see both macro monetization opportunities from us like maps and large scale content, as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of gameplay, and then over time, what you will see from us is elements of gameplay that allow gamers to engage and drive, and extend and enhance their experience, much the way people do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today. We feel very confident in our ability to deliver that in a way that is deemed valuable by our player, and drives increased engagement over time with them. It’s a given that there’s big money to be made via in-game transactions these days and EA’s own sports games make a fortune by implementing them. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 has taken it to the extremes via its paid supply drops model. Heck, GTA Online’s made over $500 million via micro transactions alone. Therefore, this shouldn’t surprise anyone but still it makes one wonder how serious the developers are about shipping a full game at launch these days compared to releasing it in bits and pieces to boost revenue.\n",

That’s when the Georgetown, Kentucky couple decided to trade in their fancy cars and comfortable lifestyle to adopt four orphans from China — each child with special needs. One of Lisa and Gene’s adopted children is a little girl named Aubrey. Not only does Aubrey have cerebral palsy, but she was neglected and abused by her biological mother. At one point, Aubrey’s birth mom attempted to smother her to death. But now that she’s part of a loving family, Aubrey couldn’t be happier — but her story has recently taken an unexpected turn. One day, Lisa’s friend and an orphanage volunteer posted a photo of an orphaned girl on Facebook. Lisa noticed the girl in the photo looked staggeringly familiar. She couldn’t shake the similarities between this unknown girl on Facebook and her adopted daughter, Aubrey. As soon as Lisa started posting the photo of the girl on her own Facebook page, even her friends and family members agreed. Feeling in her gut that there was much more to it, Lisa paid for a DNA test and sent in a swab of Aubrey’s saliva. Nothing could prepare Lisa or her family for what they discovered next...\n",

            "Paragraph: 17 days ago 0 Shares Sergio Aguero is set to do his best to persuade Argentina striker Paulo Dybala to join Pep Guardiola and Manchester City in the summer. Former Palermo striker Dybala has been a revelation for Juventus this season, notching in 23 goals and helping the Old Lady win Serie A and the Coppa Italia. Champions League winners Real Madrid are said to be interested in the 22-year old but Sergio Aguero is said to be trying to work some magic in getting Dybala to the Etihad. Pep Guardiola wants to overhaul the Manchester City squad and part of that will mean adding a host of talented young players. Dybala is one of the best young players in world football and has already proved he is capable of playing at the very highest level. City talisman Aguero has been trying to get Lionel Messi to the club, but may find it easier to influence Dybala, who would be the perfect partner for Aguero at club and international level. City won't be worried about overpaying for a player like Dybala and will give Guardiola all the necessary funds to rebuild the team. And he may well look to bring in another striker, with Wilfried Bony a shoo-in to leave the club - leaving Aguero and Kelechi Iheanacho as the only two recognised strikers. Dybala has talked about City before and has an admiration of sorts for the sky blues. \"When I play on PlayStation I always choose Barcelona or City. I dream of one day playing for one of those clubs.\" (h/t Daily Express)\n",

            "Paragraph: NEW YORK -– The horrific deaths of James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria brought worldwide attention to the dangers journalists face in war zones. The beheadings reflected an alarming trend in 2014 in which international journalists were increasingly targeted and killed. There were at least 60 journalists killed globally in connection to their work in 2014, according to an annual report from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that advocates for press freedom around the world. The latest death was Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died Saturday from injuries he sustained in a Taliban attack. Committee to Protect Journalists is still investigating whether the deaths of 18 journalists were related to their work. Reporters Without Borders recently cited 66 journalist killings in its 2014 survey. The difference likely results from each organization's methodology and the ongoing investigation of some cases. Syria, mired in civil war since 2011, ranked as the most dangerous country for journalists for the third year in a row. Seventeen journalists were killed in the war-torn country this year, bringing the total to 79 in the conflict. The organization found four journalists and three media workers killed covering the war in Gaza, five journalists in Iraq, and five journalists and two media workers in Ukraine. While this year’s overall toll is down from the 70 killed in 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists found that international journalists were more frequently targeted this year than in the past. \"Reflecting in part the increasingly volatile nature of conflict zones in which Westerners are often deliberately targeted, about one quarter of the journalists killed this year were members of the international press, about double the proportion CPJ has documented in recent years,\" the report concluded. \"Over time, according to CPJ research, about nine out of every 10 journalists killed are local people covering local stories.\" As threats against international correspondents grew in 2014, the organization noted that \"the overwhelming majority of journalists under threat for their work continue to be local.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Love handles are notorious for being almost impossible to burn off. We attack them again and again with classic stomach crunches, but they continue staring us right in the face, laughing at your despair. If a million crunches don't take away these hated fat zones, what will? In a recent Huffington Post Kyla Gagnon, a British Columbia-based fitness trainer details some scientifically-proven ways to incinerate those pesky love handles, once and for all. Love handles are notorious for being almost impossible to burn off. We attack them again and again with classic stomach crunches, but they continue staring us right in the face, laughing at your despair. If a million crunches don't take away these hated fat zones, what will? You have to see this list of 8 proven ways to tighten up those oblique abs, the muscles being hidden by your handles. You've likely done tons of standard crunches... ...and the love handles still grace your figure. Here are some incredibly simple ways to shed that side fat. 1. Bicycle Crunches! This modified crunch targets the sides of your abdominals better, the same place that those handles sit. 2. Side plank dips This is a variant of the plank that will make your core burn like crazy. Put your arm at a 90-degree angle (alternate between left and right side). Dip your hip 10-12 times on one side and then switch. 3. Standard Plank Again, keep your arms at a 90-degree angle, with your legs and back completely straight. Hold this position for 30 seconds at a time, with rest periods in between. 4. Stability Ball Plank Again, very similar to the standard plank, the stability ball plank involves raising your legs up behind you. By combining the plank moves above, you will target all of the necessary abdominal muscles needed to burn love handles. 5. Cut 100 Calories At A Time, Here And There. Ultimately, cutting down on extra calories is going to help in your battle against love handles as well. There are some really simple ways to cut this amount of calories: – Cut the coffee creamer! – Remove fries from your diet – Ditch the daily pop (or cut down to one from the two that you likely have during the day) Bam, And This Is You For The Summer\n",

            "Paragraph: Taxes on cigarettes are rising yet again in Chicago with a 50-cent increase that makes smokes in the Windy City the most highly-taxed in the country. Chicago's City Council overwhelmingly approved the cigarette tax hike as part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel's 2014 budget on Tuesday. In combination with state and local taxes, the city tax increase pushes the total taxes on cigarettes sold in the city to $7.17 a pack, WGN reports. Chicago's per-pack cigarette tax will be 31 cents higher than New York City’s $6.86 per pack making them the priciest cigarettes tax-wise in the nation. According to Emanuel's budget, the 50-cent tax increase is expected to bring in $7 million for the city, the Tribune reports. Though the tax increase is relatively hefty, it actually marks a rare concession from Mayor Emanuel. The mayor originally proposed at 75-cent increase to the objection of city councilmen concerned it would be met with increased illegal sales of loose cigarettes in their wards. The $3 million shortfall left by the lower tax increase will be filled by increasing the fine for parking in front a fire hydrant from $100 to $150 and tapping other revenue streams at the city's two airports. Ald. Jason Ervin (28th) said regardless of the mayor's decision to budge on the taxes, the high rate is likely to push smokers to purchase packs outside the city. \"We still create the black market when we raise that bar at any level,\" Ervin told the Sun-Times. Health officials, meanwhile, were dismayed that the tax on cigarettes wasn't higher. \"The cheaper the cigarettes, the more people who are going to buy cigarettes and the more people who are going to die,\" the American Heart Association’s Mark Peysakhovich told the Sun-Times the day before the City Council vote. The city, however, is still cracking down on smoking in other ways: Emanuel and a few key aldermen are reportedly looking to heavily restrict e-cigarette use in the city with rules that would effectively ban them from public spaces.\n",

Here are just a few things that she's claimed but have since been debunked: The server was permitted by the State Department. The server was just for personal communication between her and Bill Clinton. She never sent classified information. And when the FBI opened an investigation into the server, Clinton called the FBI looking into server nothing but a \"security inquiry.\" FBI Director James Comey has responded to Clinton's comments, via Fox News. And she won't like what he has to say: But when asked Wednesday by Fox News about Clinton's characterization of the bureau's probe, FBI Director James Comey said he doesn’t know what \"security inquiry\" means — adding, \"We’re conducting an investigation. ... That’s what we do.\" The FBI director reiterated that he’s \"not familiar with the term security inquiry\" when told that is the phrase Clinton has used. As for the timeline for the investigation, Comey, during a briefing with reporters, said he prefers doing the investigation \"well\" over promptly and said he’s not \"tethered\" to a schedule. The briefing comes amid reports that FBI investigators have been meeting with top aides in Clinton’s inner circle, including Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. The interviews have stoked speculation that the investigation may soon be drawing to a close, in the heat of the 2016 political season. Specifically, FBI Director Comey reassures the public that the agency is conducting a real \"investigation.\" Ouch. When asked by Fox if Clinton could face criminal charges, Comey wouldn't comment. But he also added, \"There are no special set of rules for anybody that the FBI investigates.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Late spring and early summer are beloved for a plethora of reasons, one of the best being the appearance of the soft-shell crab. If you’ve had the pleasure of eating one, you know that they hold all the flavor of your everyday crab without any of the hassle of prying meat from its sharp, thick shell -- basically, it's seafood in its most perfect state. From Japanese restaurants to road-side seafood stops, these leggy crabs are worth seeking out. But before you start feasting, you might want to know WTF they are, anyway. Soft-shell crabs are not a separate species of crab. They’re regular crabs -- in the U.S. they’re most typically blue crabs -- that have gotten too big for their shells. In order to keep on growing, they shed their shell and make new, bigger ones. In other words, they molt, and it is this molting process that makes soft-shell crabs such a treat. In order to shed its shell, the crab forms an inner soft shell underneath, swells its body with water to break its current shell, slowly crawls out -- this can take 10 minutes alone -- and then begins the process of forming a new shell. It takes a couple of days for a new shell to fully harden. That's when we want to catch them. The molting process looks a little like this. (You can watch the whole 8-minute video here). YouTube: jackienaquin Soft-shell crabs are best eaten golden and crisp. If you try to boil them as you would a normal crab, they would just fall apart. It’s a good idea to get your fill when you can because although the season is plentiful, it's also short.\n",

Giphy / Fox The hack: using a sheet mask on your VULVA. This trend is all about using a sheet mask to get your vulva date night ready, or, ya know, just ready to hang out. Because why mask your face and not your vag? Refinery29 talked to dermatologist Whitney Bowe, MD, who said that as long as it doesn’t contain \"a retinoid or powerful alpha/beta hydroxy acids, because you don’t want to irritate the skin right after [shaving or waxing],\" it’s probably NBD. Giphy We’re a little hesitant, though, about messing with our vaginas. Considering that we live in a world of super yeast infections (and not as in fun, but as in intense!) weird bouts of hardcore discharge, and reoccurring UTIs, we’re not quite ready to get to masking our vulvas quite yet. Like, why risk it? Just because it doesn’t cause something visibly terrible doesn’t mean it’s reason enough to give it a shot. Giphy No judgement, though! If you do give it a try, we salute you, of course. Let us know how it goes! We’ll leave this trend to the braver among us, thanks.\n",

            "Paragraph: Everybody wants to be a hero these days. Comedic actress Anna Kendrick is no exception. Kendrick, who has Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates hitting theaters in a few weeks, may not know much about comics or super heroes but she does have on particular Marvel character in mind should she ever suit up. \"My brother sent me a Squirrel Girl comic because he thinks I should [play her],\" Kendrick tells Net-A-Porter. \"I don’t know what Squirrel Girl does other than be half squirrel, but I could be half squirrel!\" Kendrick would probably be a great fit for the ambitious and spunky Doreen Green. Her first encounter with Iron Man, when Squirrel Girl tries to impress him and convince him to let her join his super hero escapades, would be a blast having Kendrick riffing with Robert Downey Jr.. The inspiration to play a hero does have a source for Kendrick: Ryan Reynolds. \"Ryan is one of the most authentic people I’ve worked with; I can’t think of a person more deserving of a hit like [Deadpool],\" the actress explains. \"He worked for so many years to get that film made because it’s a character that was inside of him.\" Deadpool was very much a labor of love for Reynolds who pushed to get the movie made for years on end. It wasn't until some test footage leaked and the Internet went wild in support of a Deadpool film that Reynolds got to bring the character many say he was born to play to life on the big screen. Will the same be said of Kendrick and Squirrel Girl? (via CinemaBlend)\n",

            "Paragraph: If you're looking for a narcissist, just ask. That’s according to a new video produced by New York Magazine’s The Science of Us, based on research last year that suggested you only need one question to find out which of your friends is really, really into themselves. Just ask them upfront: \"To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement: I am a narcissist.\" Apparently this question relies on the fact that a true narcissist will be unlikely to think of their narcissism as a bad thing. In the study of over 2,000 people of all ages, participants were asked to rate themselves on a scale of 1 (not very true of me) to 7 (very true of me). \"People who are willing to admit they are more narcissistic than others probably actually are more narcissistic,\" said Brad Bushman, co-author of the study and a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University. This method takes up a lot less time than the 40 question Narcissistic Personality Inventory, which was developed by Robert Raskin and Howard Terry in 1979. Since then, there have been plenty of studies into what makes a person a narcissist, and how we can become more self-aware in an age where the word \"selfie\" was awarded word of the year by the Oxford Dictionary in 2013.\n",

For breakfast, lunch and dinner I'll be eating pies only and, on a Friday, I can exchange one pie for three beers, which has a similar amount of calories.

            "Paragraph: (CNN) In recent years, FIFA has made news not just for enforcing rules on the soccer field, but also for allegedly breaking them off it. The body that governs soccer, the most popular sport in the world, is a multibillion-dollar behemoth. Great power, yes. Great responsibility? Not so much, critics say. FIFA has been regularly accused of bribery and kickbacks, allegations that reached a fever pitch after it awarded Russia and Qatar the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Afterward, the group carried out its own internal investigation and cleared itself. So why is the United States, a country where soccer ranks far below football and basketball in popularity, now taking top FIFA officials to court on corruption charges Most of the 14 people indicted aren't Americans. But as U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch lays it out, the suspects planned their crimes in the U.S.; they used the U.S. banking system; they planned to profit through schemes that targeted the \"growing U.S. market for soccer.\" \"This is a U.S. case,\" David Zirin, sports editor for The Nation magazine, said Wednesday on CNN. In order to understand how, we'll have to take you through a journey that, as you'll see, involves Americans at all stages. First up ... Michael Garcia Michael Garcia: The World Cup is a big deal. It comes around every four years, and when it does, it's the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet. When FIFA awarded the 2018 games to Russia and followed that with the even more head-scratching choice of Qatar in 2022, critics and other governments cried foul. They smelled shenanigans. They wanted a transparent account of the bidding process to see if Qatar and Russia cut any corners. FIFA brought in Michael Garcia, a onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was tasked with looking into the behavior of the two nations. He spent 19 months scrutinizing the bids to host the two tournaments. By the time he was done, his findings stretched to 350 pages. So what did FIFA do? It suppressed the report, released a puny 42-page summary -- and cleared itself of any wrongdoing in November. Garcia hit back. He labeled FIFA's findings on his report \"incomplete and erroneous.\" Then you have ... Loretta Lynch James Comey and Loretta Lynch: As we mentioned earlier, Garcia is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The guy who held that job before him? James Comey. He's the current FBI director. And the corruption charges are a result of a three-year FBI investigation. Then there's the second New York connection: Attorney General Loretta Lynch She oversaw the case in Brooklyn before she was appointed to lead the Justice Department. But why did U.S. authorities start looking into FIFA to begin with? When FIFA cleared itself of wrongdoing, the FBI wasn't ready to do the same. It wanted to know whether any of the allegations of bribe-taking and kickbacks by FIFA officials took place on American soil. Enter ... Chuck Blazer sits behind FIFA President Joseph Blatter in 2011 in Switzerland. Chuck Blazer Chuck Blazer, an American, was the No. 2 man in CONCACAF, the FIFA-affiliated governing body for North America and the Caribbean. The organization has its headquarters in Florida. Blazer had found himself in a bind. He had amassed $11 million in unreported income, the IRS said, and he hadn't paid his taxes for many, many years. He was looking at some serious prison time. He pleaded guilty in 2013 on corruption charges and became a wire-wearing informant for the feds. He provided documents and recordings of meetings with FIFA colleagues that hinted at not-so-kosher dealings, law enforcement officials said. That meant looking into the dealings of ... Jeffrey Webb, head of CONCACAF CONCACAF Remember when we mentioned CONCACAF? U.S. soccer falls under that governing body. With Blazer as a cooperating witness, American officials set out to see whether corruption touched tournaments held in the Americas. The feds say it did. One of the people facing charges now is Jeffrey Webb. He's a FIFA vice president; he heads CONCACAF; and he was Blazer's boss. Webb \"used his position of trust to solicit bribes from sports marketing executives,\" acting U.S. Attorney Kelly T. Currie of the Eastern District of New York said In return, they provided media, marketing and sponsorship rights to soccer matches in the Americas. Prosecutors said those arrested accepted bribes and kickbacks totaling more than $100 million, from the early 1990s until now. For example, $110 million in bribes changed hands in bringing Copa America , a soccer tournament usually held in South America, to the United States in 2016, Lynch said. But can the U.S. actually go after FIFA officials? Yes. Because it is ... The seal of the FBI The United States of America: The United States brought charges against the suspects because the plots were allegedly hatched on American soil. \"According to U.S. request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the U.S., and payments were carried out via U.S. banks,\" the Swiss Office of Justice said. Prosecutors also say they think the broad reach of U.S. tax and banking regulations aid their ability to bring the charges. In addition, U.S. authorities claim jurisdiction because the American television market, and billions paid by U.S. networks, is the largest for the World Cup.\n",

            "Topic: I Tried to Get Healthy and Keep Smoking Cigarettes\n",
            "Paragraph: It's been just over five years since I first picked up a cigarette—at a party, surrounded by people who seemed much cooler than me by dint of their smoking. Determined to fit in with my new social circle and with my new city—New York, a place where even the corpulent look interesting with a hand-rolled cigarette hanging from their lips—I started smoking socially, and eventually, regularly. Through the years I've quit dozens of times, to no avail. This, like any addiction, is a personal struggle. If you're an addict, no amount of disappointed friend-shaming, bummer chats with parents, or losses of potential girlfriends can make you do something you're not ready to do. I get it. Cigarettes are bad. And yet, despite all that I know about cigarettes and why they're bad, I still fucking like them. All of which brings me to my current situation. After trying for so long to quit, only to disappointingly flip between stopping and guiltily falling off the wagon, I've found a \"healthy\" medium, a half-happy place where I can smoke casually. Actually casually. It started a few months ago, when, feeling dangerously worn out for a 24-year-old, I quit smoking. I knew I wanted 2015 to be different, and I didn't want to wait until my New Year's Resolution to make it so. I joined a gym, changed my diet, and started exercising five times a week. Since November, I've kept it up, shedding some pounds and, more important, feeling better about myself as a human being. Part of this is due to the fact that, about a month into my new routine, I decided that I was doing OK and should probably ease up on my cigarette abstinence. Maybe I could be the kind of guy who keeps a pack at work, I thought, smoking a few here and there. Surprisingly, this worked out pretty well. I continued going to the gym and eating and sleeping well, all while sneaking a few smokes, balancing the good with the bad on a daily basis and seemingly achieving the impossible—gaming the system, being a healthy person while not being an entirely healthy person. The dichotomy also inspired a mutual motivation—if I had a good work out, I definitely deserved a smoke, and if I smoked heavily on a particular day, I definitely ate a healthy lunch. With the devil on one shoulder and angel on the other, I felt like I'd found universal balance. Maybe I didn't have to fully quit after all. Maybe it's possible to lead a healthy life while continuing to smoke regularly. Do we not have to quit? I decided to investigate. \"It's important to first define what is meant by 'a healthy lifestyle,'\" said Dr. Azure B. Thompson, the associate director of policy and research at the CASAColumbia addiction center. Thompson, an expert on the social determinants of substance abuse, said that while a healthy lifestyle is defined by eating well, being active and managing stress, \"people may comply with some of these activities and believe they are leading an 'otherwise healthy lifestyle,' but by smoking cigarettes regularly you are not protecting yourself from harm.\" Harm, of course, being stuff like long-term lung damage and increased risk of cancer, heart disease, respiratory disease, and stroke. By smoking while living healthily, you're welcoming dangerous entrants into your body, but it's not like I was smoking a pack a day. If I am letting toxins in, at least it's not like they're waltzing in through the front door. It's more like they're sneaking in through the window I cracked. In theory, I should be able to keep doing what I'm doing so long as I don't fall back into my pack-a-day habit, right? \"I think that is a natural sentiment,\" Thompson countered. \"With some potentially unhealthy behaviors,\" like eating junk food or drinking alcohol, \"we are told that they are OK in moderation, but there is no way to game the harmful effects when it comes to cigarette smoking.\" According to Thompson, not only am I not supposed to smoke if I want to live a healthy life, but I'm not even supposed to be near a place where smoking is happening. \"Any exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful,\" she assured me. \"Risks are not limited to heavy or long-term smokers.\" Still, living a totally smoke-free existence is an unrealistic ideal: if you're a social person in your 20s, you're bound to be regularly surrounded by smoking peers, and if you live in a major city, second-hand smoke is almost unavoidable. Thompson gave me the answer I knew was coming—of course the addiction researcher is going to tell me not to be addicted! I needed input from another source, so I reached out to Jonathan Henry, a certified personal trainer. Though Henry is a kindergarten teacher who knows a bit about how to compromise with crying six-year-olds, he doesn't compromise in his night work, which is making sure people stop putzing around with their bodies and get healthy to stay that way. \"It is not possible to lead an otherwise healthy lifestyle while smoking cigarettes,\" he told me as soon as I brought up the question of whether or not I could lift and still smoke. \"Doing so is the exact contradiction to living a healthy lifestyle,\" he added for clarity. I should note here that Jonathan trained me once—when I was in my heavy-smoking phase—and nearly made me pass out by telling me to do 100 jumping jacks. Before doing the jumping jacks, I looked and felt like a normal person. \"Even if an individual doesn't look out of shape due to their fast metabolism, eats well, and does some type of exercise,\" Henry told me, through smoking, \"damage is being done to the vital organs and will eventually be visible to the individual and the world.\" Jonathan went on to say that if I don't quit smoking soon, even while living my otherwise \"healthy\" lifestyle, my gym routine and diet would eventually fall by the wayside. Still! I'm feeling mostly OK. I no longer struggle when I walk up a few flights of stairs. I don't have an agonizing chest cough, the sort only fellow pack-a-day smokers could relate to. And I don't smell so much like smoke that my mom winces in dismay when I hug her. Everything's fine. Besides, sometimes I need a cigarette. Sometimes things aren't going great at work, my relationship feels more taxing than usual, or I'm just crippled with fear about getting older. You know, just normal 20-something stuff, most of which usually fades away after a smoke break. Even if it's clearly not a physically healthy activity, maybe smoking provides some sort of mental health benefits, especially for those of us who do it to relieve personal stress. I reached out for validation from Margie Cohen, a California-based psychotherapist whose ex-wife was a longtime smoker. Surely she'd understand. \"It is my job to track and respect people's choices,\" said Cohen, \"and especially to help them understand and find new ways to manage the emotions that smoking is helping them medicate.\" Some of which, she said, if unchecked can create a distance between a person and the possibility of living a deeply rewarding life. According to Cohen, smoking, like any other addictive substance, while typically mislabeled as a stress reliever, functions more so as a distraction from issues lying beneath the surface. \"It has been my experience that a person's relationship to smoking will become less compelling if they are less fearful of their feelings and of their previous traumatic experiences,\" said Cohen. Cohen seemed to stand firmly beside Henry and Thompson in the belief that smoking is unequivocally bad, both mentally and physically, though she admitted that quitting—an \"empowering choice that will help move a person toward greater fulfillment and happiness\"—isn't something she'd push someone to do if they weren't ready. If a person is quitting simply to \"comply with social or internal pressure to 'do what's right,'\" said Cohen, \"it will probably not be a choice they can manage successfully, and may likely add to their stress, self-blame, shame, and low self-esteem.\" So according to the experts I spoke with and common sense, it is not possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle without quitting smoking. But the very reason I started living this new life in the first place was to avoid the feelings of stress and low self-esteem Cohen mentioned above, and for the first time in my young life, I've found a footing between careful and irresponsible by forcing myself to sacrifice while allowing myself transgressions. So for now, I'd rather just keep smoking, blindly soldiering on with this unhealthy addiction no matter how painful it may be in the long run.\n",

            "Paragraph: Jamie Dimon is mad. He's mad -- like so many Americans -- about the state of public education in many American cities. Especially in Detroit. \"This is probably one of the biggest disasters, Not just Detroit. A lot of inner city schools in America,\" Dimon told CNNMoney in an exclusive interview in Detroit. \"Americans should understand that 50%, or something like, of the kids in inner-city schools, often poor and often minority, don't graduate. And the ones that do, don't necessarily have the skills to get a job. That is the biggest disgrace in this country,\" Dimon lamented. \"We should be ringing an alarm bell on every hilltop and every mountain top and saying this shouldn't be allowed.\" In a separate event for a group of entrepreneurs in Detroit, Dimon pointed out that there were more than 5 million open jobs in the U.S. right now, near a record high. With some 8 million unemployed Americans, the problem is a skills gap. Dimon argues the failure to educate America's youth with the skills needed to get these jobs is the ultimate societal failure. As CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Dimon spent the day in Detroit recently to meet with entrepreneurs and small-business owners and see the impact of a $100 million commitment his bank has made to the revival of the city. The bank on Wednesday announced an additional $4 million towards an initiative (along with the Skillman Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Ford Motor Company Fund) to connect 10,000 Detroit high school students to career education and work experiences over the next three years. \"JPMorgan was founded in Detroit...We're the biggest bank here, consumer, commercial, large corporate. So it's an important town to us,\" Dimon told CNNMoney. \"We've watched Detroit become a train wreck for 20 years.\" But when Dimon met Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan following his 2014 election, he started to view the city in a different light. \"This mayor is just practical, and thoughtful and not sanctimonious, and not ideological.\" In Duggan, Dimon saw a mayor who said: \"Let's turn the lights on and get sanitation better. Let's rehab some abandoned homes. Let's get businesses back in town. We said we're all in.\" JP Morgan is two years into a $100 million investment in Detroit. Here's where some of the money is going: -- $50 million to finance the development of commercial, retail and mixed-income housing in Detroit -- $6.5 million to fund loans to minority-owned small businesses through an Entrepreneurs of Color Fund in partnership with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation -- $4 million to preserve affordable housing -- $1.5 million towards job training and summer youth employment Detroit has a long way to go The city may be on the mend, but after becoming the biggest American city ever to go bankrupt -- Detroit still has a long way to go. The Motor City is still battered and bruised. Unemployment here is about twice the national average and some 30,000 homes remain abandoned. To say the financial crisis -- and rampant foreclosures -- hit Detroit hard is an understatement. And many here still point their finger squarely at Wall Street and its biggest banks. \"JP Morgan obviously made mistakes,\" Dimon told CNNMoney. \"But to me, we were also steadfast. If you talk about JP Morgan, we were here in the darkest moments for everybody at all time. We didn't run. We didn't hide. All the big banks rolled over trillions of dollars of loans when the market place wasn't willing to. But we've made mistakes. We try to admit the mistakes. We learn from them and move on. And we've paid a heavy price for them.\" For city to rise, focus on public schools In Detroit, Dimon sees a city that could rise again. But he admits, that cannot happen unless Detroit's public schools thrive. The Detroit Public School district is in utter disrepair and the bankruptcy that relieved the city of $7 billion in debt missed Detroit's schools completely. The Detroit public school system was not included in the city's financial reorganization. The school district, with more than $500 million in operating debt according to the Michigan governor's office, is on track to run out of money to pay its teachers and staff by the end of June. In protest, many of the teachers have joined sick-outs closing down a majority of the district's 97 schools, sometimes for days at a time. The state-appointed emergency manager, though, assured teachers in May they will be paid for the full school year. It's not just a salary fight. Many of the school buildings in Detroit are outdated, dilapidated and physically decaying. Dimon sees the problem on a national scale. \"Among those people not graduating, there might be a Steve Jobs or Barack Obama. We'll never know,\" he said. The National Center for Education Statistics data show low income students are five times more likely to drop out of high school than high income students. High school graduates make about $630,000 more over their lifetimes than non-high school graduates. Community college degree that doesn't lead to a job isn't worth it Dimon acknowledged the immediate need is \"the right curriculum, the right teachers, the right help and the right money\" but in education he sees a bigger need -- paying more attention to vocational education in areas where the jobs are. \"Having a community college degree, and you get out and have no job, is a sense of hopelessness,\" he said. \"They have to work together with local businesses to make sure that what they are being taught is what the businesses need.\" Mayor Duggan bluntly says there is no way his city can turnaround without it. \"Everything about reducing poverty is bringing in businesses and getting our young people educated and having the skills to work. If you don't do both things, we won't fundamentally change the trajectory in the city,\" he said in an interview with CNNMoney in Detroit. So with the schools in such disrepair -- why is JP Morgan betting $100 million on Detroit? Dimon sees this city's comeback in it's \"entrepreneurial spirit\" noting in a recent op-ed the 61,000 small businesses (50,000 of them minority-owned) as part and parcel to returning Detroit to a thriving metropolis. Dimon calls it the \"job\" -- the responsibility -- of institutions, including big business, to partner with local government to create an environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. He points to research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute which found 58% of consumer spending in Detroit happens at small businesses -- compared to an average of 36% in 14 other cities the Institute studied. Duggan is quick to point out the $100 million JPMorgan has committed to Detroit is not charity. \"Business is in business to make money and I'm not under any illusion. I think JPMorgan is gonna make a lot of money off of Detroit because they're invested in the city at a time is down and they're gonna be a central part of the growth,\" the mayor said. \"I bet Jamie Dimon would be the first to tell you he expects JPMorgan Chase to benefit significantly from Detroit's recovery.\" Asked if he sees Detroit as a smart investment, Dimon told CNNMoney \"I hope so. If it doesn't work I'll feel far worse for the people of Detroit than I do for JPMorgan. But yes I hope it can be a little part of turning around this great city.\" -- Chris Isidore and Heather Long contributed to this article.\n",

            "Topic: John Slattery's 'God's Pocket' Shows That Seriously Everyone Wants To Work With Him\n",
            "Paragraph: After years of playing Roger Sterling on AMC’s \"Mad Men,\" John Slattery is comfortable with a drink in his hand. Sitting on a leather couch in Park City, Utah with a Bloody Mary by his side, Slattery talks less about the ad men of the 1960s and more about the first film that he directed, \"God’s Pocket,\" which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The dark comedy needs a better adjective than \"dark,\" because most of the film reveals deeply-rooted sadness, disappointment and failures –- carried out to perfection by a dream-team cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christina Hendricks, Richard Jenkins and John Turturro. Slattery has directed five episodes of \"Mad Men\" but this is his first attempt at a feature. Based on the theater’s applause on opening night, his future as a director certainly looks bright. The Huffington Post joined Slattery couch-side to find out why it took 10 years to make this happen, how surfing keeps him from getting \"a little screwy\" and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time. [Warning: plot spoilers throughout] When did you originally come across the material for \"God’s Pocket\"? I read the book by Pete Dexter about 10 years ago and tried to get the rights to it. But it’s a good thing I didn’t get the rights, because I probably wouldn't be able to actually make a good movie then. I tried getting the rights but someone else owned them. So I let it go. About five years later, someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book? Turns out the rights were then available. So I said, all right I’m going to outline this thing, because I had written a shitty screenplay in between and I didn’t want to do that again. I did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. I said, okay let’s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. The rights were not available. Same people still owned it. After you had put all that time into it! I was making \"The Adjustment Bureau\" at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day. So it was like are you going to watch TV or do this? When I was told I couldn’t have it, I thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven’t done anything with it I’m just going to write it anyway. And if someone else makes it first, fine. Eventually Bob Gersh from The Gersh Agency worked out the deal. Do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn’t have it at first? It sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way. When you’re sitting around, like actors do, and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet, I would do this. At the end of the day, I’d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and I wouldn’t feel crazy that day. Do you have a different itch that’s satisfied by writing versus acting? It’s the same if I were acting in a play or directing. Creative people go on vacation and four days in you’re like I gotta get out of here. I have a lot of energy, so I’m told. I surf a lot. You live in L.A.? Half the time. For \"Mad Men\" we’re in New York so I have a place I go surfing in Long Island. Isn’t that freezing? In the winter it is. But there’s all kinds of gear now, it’s like skiing almost. If I sit around and do nothing for a while, I get a little screwy. What did you find most compelling about the material in \"God’s Pocket\"? What made you want to make this film? It’s very visual, which appealed to me. I sort of see things in pictures -- I don’t know whether that makes me dumb or smart. Like a kid almost. And the dialogue, by which I mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. It was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything. The book is very interior. It takes place in Mickey’s head, which was difficult to do in a film. You have to show that, you can’t tell it. That was a challenge. Mickey’s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with. He feels that if I lose this woman then I’ll never get anybody else like that. I think there’s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it. So even though she might not be in love with him anymore, he doesn’t really belong in this place, he has no affinity for this place, he just has this woman. What I think you get from Christina’s performance is the disappointment she feels. He’s not picking up on the signals of what she needs, you see them having sex and obviously that’s not going very well. He can’t express himself. And she needs something. She needs to find out what happened to her son. She needs him to step up and do the right thing, and he’s trying but they’re missing each other. Did you consider acting in the film? No. I got asked if I was going to, and every time I said no, people were like, \"good idea.\" [laughs] Which I was like, \"what the hell do you mean by that?\" I ask because you’ve directed a handful of \"Mad Men\" episodes. That’s the least sort of fun of the whole thing -– being in it. Some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene, have done your homework, know the lines, and you sit down and it can be really fun. Because you know what you’re doing on one side of the camera and know what you’re doing on the other. Like Woody Allen, I mean I would never even put myself in the same stratosphere, but he is Woody Allen. He knows what he knows and he has the time he has. Ben Affleck -- I have to say, I admire the hell out of that guy with a move like \"Argo.\" To direct it and then give that kind of performance. I don’t know how the hell he dealt with that stress. Another example of directors starring in movies is here at Sundance –- Zach Braff’s new film \"Wish I Was Here.\" I’m interested in Zach taking 10 years to do this. I’m sure there are all kinds of reasons –- he was acting, he was being successful in all kinds of ways. I’d like to try it sometime, but you’d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn’t feel like \"Oh I shouldn’t have done this.\" How did you cast this film? Did you just ask Christina Hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie? I went to Phil [Seymour Hoffman] first. You go through the proper channels because you don’t want to burden anybody with \"do me a favor.\" That’s a drag. I sent him the script and I anticipated that he would let me down easy and say I like it but I don’t have time. I had sent it with an offer for the part of Shelburne. He called and said, \"I love the script, but I want to play Mickey.\" And it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was. So I said all right, in. Then I mentioned it to Christina because I was directing an episode of \"Mad Men\" and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person. I hadn’t gotten Phil to officially commit yet so I said here’s the script, I’d love you to play this part and I hope to get Phil. She was thrilled. I sent it to Richard Jenkins who is represented by my agent. About 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. And then John Turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. I was just floored. There’s a scene where Christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. She slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film. She condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. What I wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency. All these guys know their weight in the world -- whether it’s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want. She knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out. She realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants. But then he doesn’t give her what she wants. And in the end she watches him getting beaten in the street and she just walks away, letting it happen. If she had said stop, they would have stopped. You mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different. What do you think you bring to the table now? I think just seeing more of everything. Life. You get to a point where you’re young and you’re an actor and everything is always about \"if I could just get this,\" \"if I could only get that.\" And then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain. This is what I do well. I don’t do everything well. I can’t play everything. I’m not a movie star. I don’t want to be a movie star. Your aspirations become more your own. And then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively. You watch other people do their thing and you think, \"I could do this. I can try at this.\" You also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing. There’s actor A, B, C and then there’s Phil Hoffman. And Richard Jenkins and Christina Hendricks and John Turturro. And the fact that they said yes . That’s also a testament to you. But when it really comes down to it, it’s because you recognize what they do. You really recognize what they’re capable of doing and I should be so lucky to be able to work with those guys.\n",

            "Topic: Why Are Indian Kids So Good at Spelling?\n",
            "Paragraph: On Thursday night, 13-year-old Jairam Hathwar and 11-year-old Nihar Janga were declared co-winners of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, making this the ninth bee in a row to name an Indian-American victor. In honor of their victory, Slate revisits Ben Paynter’s story, originally published in 2010, which explains Indian-Americans’ prowess in spelling competitions. It is reprinted below. This April's North South Foundation bee in Shawnee, Kan., might seem like an obscure place to find the spelling world's two biggest stars. Mostly, it looked like the sort of geeky local bee I might have attended as a kid—except everyone there was Indian. Inside Shawnee's Hindu Temple and Cultural Center, 23 awkward kids took turns passing a microphone back and forth in a hushed beige auditorium. No spotlights, no podium, just cringe-inducing feedback on the P.A. system. And for the record, the spelling was a-t-r-o-c-i-o-u-s. Just three of the first 10 contestants spelled their words correctly. At one point, a poor kid paced in circles and clutched his crotch before misspelling beleaguered and sprinting off to the restroom. Amid it all, 13-year-old Kavya Shivashankar pronounced words from a fold-out judging table as her father, Mirle, emceed in a sharp dark suit. Kavya, the 2009 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion, is a spelling superstar complete with signature move: She air-writes each word across her palm before speaking it. Kavya and Mirle—her innovative, ever-enthusiastic coach—were at the small-time competition to pay homage. Over the past two decades, tournaments like this one—a regional qualifier for the North South Foundation's spelling league—have become a breeding ground for Scripps contenders. These minor-league competitions help kids as young as 6 years old work out the spelling kinks at an early age. The result has been an Indian-American dynasty at the National Spelling Bee. Consider the facts: Indian-Americans make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population; this year, an estimated 30 NSF-ers will compete at Scripps, 11 percent of the 273-kid field. Recent winners include Sai R. Gunturi from Dallas, who nonchalantly reassembled pococurante for a national title in 2003. Sameer Mishra from West Lafayette, Ind., nailed guerdon in 2008. And four-time finalist Shivashankar made it back-to-back titles for North South Foundation competitors last year, air-writing Laodicean for the win. If Shivashankar hadn't come through, it's possible another North South graduate would have: Four other NSF kids cracked the top 10 behind her. The NSF circuit consists of 75 chapters run by close to 1,000 volunteers. The competitions, which began in 1993, function as a nerd Olympiad for Indian-Americans—there are separate divisions for math, science, vocab, geography, essay writing, and even public speaking—and a way to raise money for college scholarships for underprivileged students in India. There is little financial reward for winners (just a few thousand dollars in college scholarships) compared with the $40,000 winning purse handed out each year by Scripps. Still, more than 3,000 kids participated in NSF's spelling events this year due in part to what NSF founder Ratnam Chitturi calls a sort of Kavya Effect. \"Most American kids look up to sports figures,\" he says. \"Indian kids are more interested in education, and they finally have a role model.\" Just as Kavya Shivashankar has inspired the next wave of Indian spellers, Kavya found her bee mojo during the post- Spellbound boom. Before Spellbound, the 2002 documentary that featured Indian-American Nupur Lala's run to the 1999 Scripps title, many first-generation South Asian parents saw NSF as a way for their children to assimilate—the best way to understand a culture, after all, is to learn its language. They used the North South Foundation events as a sort of SAT prep, teaching their children to use phonetics, etymology, and word roots to suss out answers. \"Our focus is not on competition,\" says Chitturi. \"Winning becomes an outcome of you focusing on learning. You are competing against yourself, not these other people.\" After Spellbound, that changed a bit. After Balu Natarajan (winning word: milieu) became the first Indian-American to win Scripps back in 1985, he went on to a career in sports medicine. When Lala did it in 1999 with logorrhea, she became a movie star. (OK, a movie star and a neuroscientist.) Kavya has called Lala an inspiration—the license plate of Mirle's teal minivan reads \"SPL BND.\" She's far from alone. In 2002, NSF had less than 20 chapters pulling in about 500 mostly middle-school-age spellers. Then pop culture galvanized an expansion to elementary schoolers; today, six times as many students compete in North South Foundation spelling events. \"The parents were just excited,\" Chitturi says. \"They saw that it was a possibility [to win the National Spelling Bee].\" It's no coincidence, then, that in the last decade North South Foundation has transformed from an SAT prep course into a training ground for Scripps. It wasn't too long ago that NSF standouts like Kamran Riaz and 2000 champion Ashley Thakur didn't compete at the National Spelling Bee. Riaz, for one, remembers NSF as a nice \"alternative\" to Scripps. Thakur's thoughts on the National Spelling Bee: \"Not to brag, but I don't think it would be a hard cake to cut,\" she once bragged to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It's not quite right to say that Riaz and Thakur didn't go to nationals because they didn't think it was a big deal. The more significant reason is that they simply weren't eligible. You have to be more than a great speller to qualify for the National Bee—you also have to live in a school district with a sponsoring newspaper or community organization. These days, parents seem to be paying a lot more attention to such logistics. When Mirle Shivashankar realized in 2005 that there was just one Scripps sponsor in all of Kansas, he beat the bushes to ensure that more kids from the state—his daughter, for one—would have the chance to go to nationals. Kavya subsequently gained all of her berths to the nationals by virtue of a brand-new sponsor, the Olathe News. The North South Foundation could dominate Scripps even further, if more of its spellers were eligible to compete. In areas with more gifted NSFers than competition zones, the battle to get into Scripps can be intense. Whereas regional North South Foundation competitions are run like standardized tests—the best scores get weighted against a national average to determine the national finalists—Scripps operates more like a crazy single-elimination tournament. The winner in each local bracket funnels into a pool of finalists, who repeat the same process to pick a winner. That can lead to some powerhouse regional showdowns. In San Jose, Calif., for instance, eventual 2009 NSF senior co-champion Ramya Auroprem had to beat out 2009 NSF runner-up Sidarth Jayadev just to make it into last year's National Spelling Bee finals. North South Foundation winners don't have to worry about Kavya Shivashankar anymore—she has retired. At the Shawnee NSF contest this April, Swetha Jasti placed first, with a perfect score that qualified her for NSF nationals later this summer. But unfortunately for Jasti, she won't make it to Scripps this year. When the National Spelling Bee starts up this week, their region will be represented by a surprise challenger: Kavya's 8-year-old sister, Vanya, who drubbed Jasti in the National Spelling Bee's Olathe qualifier.\n",

            "Topic: Out Of All Men's Haircuts, This Is The Most Requested In America\n",
            "Paragraph: Preferred haircuts for men are constantly evolving. Except for one particular style. Ask your barber to scissor-cut the top of your head to about an inch and a half, adding a bit of texture to the ends with a razor. Around the sides and back, have him use a clipper to taper the length down to about a quarter inch, or an eighth if you feel like going really short. This gives the face a squared look, where the sides are blended straight up and the top is slicked back with no visible part. The heavy-on-top style is juxtaposed with a side of cool, with facial hair and cool specs. You could achieve a formal look by slicking the full part of your hair with a hairdryer and a Denman brush for volume. Spritz some hairspray to firm it up. Asymmetrical faux hawks give the appearance of playfulness. Get some gel and gather your hair up to one side with your fingers. Beau-haute! Wavy hair? No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too! Pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler! Check out the short but informative men's hair tutorial of achieving the most popular hairstyle in America.H/T - GQ\n",

            "Paragraph: A new study finds that sleep habits vary widely depending on where you live. You’d think the most sleep-deprived state in the nation would be somewhere in the sleepless northeast, right? But you’d be wrong. A new study has found that the state with the worst sleep habits in the country is Hawaii. So while Hawaii may make a popular vacation destination for those looking for relax, the people who live there are depriving themselves of sleep, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. The study examined how many Americans were getting less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night, and found alarmingly that a third of Americans aren’t getting that amount of rest, based on a poll of 400,000 adults in all 50 states. Hawaii scored the worst at 56.1 percent. The best? South Dakota at 71.6 percent. Geographically, the Great Plains states tended to score the best, as well as states along the Appalachian Mountains. However, southern states also performed poorly along with Hawaii, such as Alabama and Georgia. And don’t think that the people who work hard every day are the ones deprived of sleep. It’s actually people who are unable to work or who are unemployed who get the least amount of sleep. Married people not surprisingly tend to have better sleep habits than single, with 67 percent of married people getting the 7 hours of rest compared to 62 percent of people who are not married. Those who are divorced or widowed fare worse than single people, reporting at 56 percent. And your education matters. About 72 percent of people with a college degree got the requisite 7 hours of sleep. \"As a nation we are not getting enough sleep,\" Wayne Giles, M.D., director of CDC’s Division of Population Health, said in a statement. \"Lifestyle changes such as going to bed at the same time each night; rising at the same time each morning; and turning off or removing televisions, computers, mobile devices from the bedroom, can help people get the healthy sleep they need.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: At first glance, Jon Bivens thought his son had been rewarded for good behavior with a smiley face stamp on his arm. Then, he noticed the writing underneath and realized that his third grader had been stamped with the words, \"I Need Lunch Money.\" Shocked at first, he didn’t register the implications of the stamp. As it turns out, the elementary school that Bivens’ son attends, Gardendale Elementary in Gardendale, AL, operates its cafeteria with refillable charge cards. Students who buy lunch at school swipe the card to pay for lunch. Parents keep the cards refilled by topping them up with money from time to time and are notified if the balance runs low. Bivens understood the card system, but was shocked by the method of delivery. His little boy brings a packed lunch to school almost every day and rarely needs lunch money, unless he wants to buy a special treat from the cafeteria. As a result, he almost never has to use his school lunch card and his parents decided not to top it up so close to the end of the school year. Still, Jon Bivens told The Huntsville Times that he was stunned by the way that the school had chosen to convey the message to him as a parent. He says that, in the past, the school had called or sent emails or letters to remind parents of the balance. The stamp, which he calls a \"brand,\" was typically a communication of last resort for the school. Bivens says he received no direct contact, and adds, \"When you start stamping a message on a child’s body instead of calling...it’s not okay.\" He also calls the stamping, \"a form of bullying.\" From his perspective as a parent, it was completely uncalled-for behavior from the school.\n",

            "Paragraph: All week, we've been running our 2017 summer movie preview. Previously, we shared our funniest, scariest, most action-packed, and most nostalgia-friendly picks. Today, we're wrapping things up with the best of the best: the six films we're most excited to see, period. The best thing about summer movie season is also the worst thing about summer movie season: there's just so much to look forward to, that odds are we probably won't have time to see everything we want. Which is why even on our lengthy to-do list, we've reserved a section for films we'll drop everything to see, no matter what.  Today's picks aren't linked by genre or tone. We've got big films and little ones, movies you've seen plastered all over billboards and ones you've (probably) never heard of. The only thing they all have in common is that we absolutely cannot wait to see them.  So without further ado, here's what to watch if you just want to see the best of the best ... You know that bloody, brutal, every-man-for-himself shootout at the end of all those action thrillers? In Free Fire, it's basically the whole movie. Brie Larson, Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley, and Cillian Murphy play just a few of the participants in an illegal arms deal gone sour. Unsurprisingly, the simmering tension quickly boils over into full-on violence. More unexpectedly, the gunfight turns out to be as funny as it is nasty, thanks to crisp and clever dialogue by Amy Jump and Ben Wheatley.  2017 brings us no fewer than six major superhero movies, and three of those land smack dab in the middle of summer. But for our money, the one to watch out for is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. We'd follow these a-holes anywhere, especially when their next adventure promises more Baby Groot, more classic rock tunes, and the addition of Kurt Russell as a planet who also happens to be Star-Lord's dad.  Sometimes we want a movie that'll make us belly-laugh. Sometimes we want one that'll make us ugly-cry. Sometimes we're in the mood to swoon over a romance. And every once in a while, we're lucky enough to stumble upon one that promises to do all three. Silicon Valley's Kumail Nanjiani stars in a dramatization of his own true story, in which his now-wife Emily Gordon (played here by Zoe Kazan) fell into a medically induced coma shortly after they started dating. Bring tissues, but also be prepared to laugh 'til your sides hurt. Baby Driver might look more Fate of the Furious than La La Land, but hear us out. The musicality of this movie is baked right into its premise: Ansel Elgort plays a talented getaway driver who blasts music all day to drown out the ringing in his ears. Through him, we experience an action thriller where gunshots are set to drumbeats, where cars zip along in time to the rhythm, where chases and fistfights are choreographed like dance numbers. Leave it to Hot Fuzz director Edgar Wright to put a fresh spin on two genres at once.  The Fifth Element definitely wasn't everyone's cup of tea. But if it was yours, you'll want to keep an eye out for Luc Besson's next outer space adventure, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne play a pair of special operatives on a mission to save the universe, etc., etc., we've heard it all before. The reason we're excited for this one, though, is that Besson has a knack for weird, quirky details – like Rihanna in a supporting role as a shapeshifting entertainer. That could be worse the price of admission alone. There's the kind of light social media stalking we all indulge in from time to time, and then there's the kind of extreme social media stalking that sends lives careening off the rails. And if we're being really honest, the line between can get kind of fuzzy in practice. Ingrid Goes West is about a woman who's definitely on the wrong side of that divide, played by Aubrey Plaza fresh off of her awesome terrifying turn in Legion. And don't sleep on O'Shea Jackson Jr. as her landlord, either – Sundance buzz says it's a small role, but a big breakthrough.\n",

That man, the notoriously awful Ukranian pseudo-red-carpet-reporter Vitalii Sediuk, is known for assaulting celebrities like America Ferrara, Bradley Cooper, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Adele. Initial reports had Sediuk punching Pitt in the face. Not so, says Pitt in a new interview with People. \"I was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me. I took a step back; this guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so I cracked him twice in the back of the head – not too hard – but enough to get his attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just grabbing for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses.\" Badass Pitt also warns that if Sediuk tries his assault-and-battery schtick again, \"he's going to get stomped.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: The beginning of a new legal industrial hemp industry may have been born on Wednesday in Colorado with the release of new hemp farming regulations. The regulations call for farmers to register and pay a $200 annual fee in addition to $1 for every acre of hemp planted and plants will be regularly inspected to make sure that the hemp contains no more than .3 percent THC, according to a report from The Denver Post. Next week, the hemp advisory committee that created the rules will turn them in for approval by Colorado's Department of Agriculture. Marijuana's sober sister contains little to no THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana associated with the \"high\" sensation and has dozens of uses including paper, oils, cosmetics and textiles. For hundreds of years in the U.S., hemp was grown and used to make rope, sails, lamp oil and clothing. American industrial hemp production peaked in 1943, with more than 150 million pounds on 146,200 harvested acres. But then production dropped to zero in the late 1950s over \"anti-drug sentiment and competition from synthetic fibers,\" according to the Associated Press. The passage of Amendment 64 in Colorado last November, which famously legalized marijuana for recreational use by adults, also allows for the commercial growing of hemp. Although the rules are just now getting set up and technically Colorado won't be granting hemp growing-cultivation licenses until 2014, the U.S. has already seen an industrial hemp crop harvested for the first time in nearly 60 years by Springfield, Colo. farmer Ryan Loflin. Back in May, Loflin planted 55 acres of hemp and in October he and others harvested the historic plants by hand as advocates watched on, Denver's Westword reported. But the same month Loflin began planting his hemp seeds, Colorado Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture Ron Carleton clarified that although A64 had passed, it did not authorize the cultivation of hemp in Colorado until those rules were in place. \"The General Assembly, with SB13-241, has made it clear that cultivation, for either commercial or research and development purposes, is not authorized unless the prospective grower first registers with the Department,\" Carleton said in a statement. \"That will not be possible until early 2014 as we do not expect the registration program to be in place before then.\" But that didn't stop Loflin, who told Westword he's not worried about law enforcement. \"It's time for this to happen,\" he said. Attorney General Eric Holder recently announced that the Department of Justice will allow Colorado's new marijuana laws to go into effect, but despite that, the U.S. government still considers the hemp plant to be a Schedule 1 controlled substance, similar to its genetic sibling marijuana, and therefore illegal to cultivate or grow on U.S. soil. And although several states like Kentucky, West Virginia and North Dakota have hemp laws on the books, a federal hemp bill that would end hemp prohibition has yet to be passed.\n",

            "Paragraph: Well, there you go. With the Academy Awards, sometimes you just never know. Or, rather you do, if you know where to look. The victory lap for \"Birdman\" at the Oscars on Sunday night, scooping best picture and director, presumably away from \"Boyhood,\" made sense to people well versed in the Academy’s ways. The organization often is deaf, even resistant, to the inclinations of critics, many of whom crowned \"Boyhood\" the year’s best. Entertainment Weekly’s January cover story anointing the film as \"this year’s Oscar front-runner\" probably didn’t help the film’s cause (or, since we’re on the topic, a not-so-flattering piece in The New York Times the weekend voting opened). \"Birdman\" had so many elements for actors and below-the-line craftspeople to chew on: the ballyhooed long shots, which won the cinematographer an Oscar; the actors having to work with clockwork precision; the storyline itself. Seasoned Oscar watchers said they knew it was over for \"Boyhood\" when \"Whiplash\" took the editing award: the Academy’s respect for how Richard Linklater’s film was sewn together by the editor would have to be paramount in order for the picture to win. There was some surprise that Mr. Linklater didn’t collect best director, but as others have noted, the Directors Guild Award – which went this year to Alejandro G. Iñárritu – is often the bellwether of where that Oscar will land. But it was clearly the night for \"Birdman\" – to the great joy of the folks at New Regency and Fox Searchlight, who were behind last year’s winner, too, \"12 Years a Slave.\" \"Birdman\" even won best original screenplay, a surprise, since Wes Anderson’s \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" had a story line that was at once more sweeping and more delicate, and collected a Writers Guild Award. Yet every film that had been nominated for best picture collected some kind of award, a nice outcome. And, hurrah, Alexandre Desplat finally won an Oscar for best original soundtrack, for his yodeler-laced compositions for \"The Grand Budapest Hotel,\" this after getting nominated eight times. (Mind you, two of those nominations were from this year; even he was worried they’d cancel each other out.) It’s good to note, for those still mourning the losses of \"Boyhood,\" that a small independent film about the passing of time wouldn’t have had a chance in many other years, something Mr. Linklater noted on the red carpet. \"I think if ‘Birdman’ and ‘Boyhood’ are duking it out,\" he said, \"that’s pretty amazing.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Lady Gaga may dress however she pleases in real life, but even she isn't immune to the clever hand of Photoshop on her magazine photos. At Glamour's 2013 Women of the Year Awards on Monday, the December Glamour cover girl accepted her award with a sharp critique of her own recent Glamour photos. Speaking onstage at Carnegie Hall, Lady Gaga said that, like fellow honoree Malala Yousafzai, she was going to use her voice to speak up about her cover. \"I felt my skin looked too perfect. I felt my hair looked too soft,\" said the star. \"I do not look like this when I wake up in the morning... I don't even look like this,\" referring to her wild wig and makeup for the evening. Speaking slowly and measuredly, Gaga made it clear that the way covers like hers are tweaked and smoothed has damaging effects on the readers who see them. She urged the young people listening to \"fight back against the forces that make them feel like they're not beautiful,\" and she also called for the publications themselves to change: \"It is fair to write about the change in your magazines. But what I want to see is the change on your covers... When the covers change, that's when culture changes.\" Gaga's outspoken critique was a bold move, given that she was receiving an award from the very magazine she was critiquing. But the overarching message of her lengthy speech was acceptance, particularly of people's quirks, tastes and appearances. She herself has been the victim of Photoshop before; most memorably, Vogue took heat last fall for digitally slimming Lady Gaga's figure on the September 2012 cover. She didn't speak out loudly against the blatant use of airbrushing back then; but she used her platform at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards to do so last night. See the cover in question below. Do you think stars like Gaga calling for change could finally made a difference in the magazine industry?\n",

The cuckoos were cuckoo-ing on the hour, and the pendulums were swinging to and fro with each passing second without incident. Until a visitor to the museum decided to start playing with one of the clocks. The museum released security footage from May 31 showing a tourist touching one of the clocks before it comes crashing down from the wall. The video is captioned: \"This is why we beg and plead with our visitors to please refrain from touching objects in museums.\" Indeed. In the video, an abstract, wooden sculpture clock appeared not to be working, so a male tourist decided to take matters into his own hands, pulling on weights and levers for more than 30 seconds before the clock came flying off the wall and into pieces on the floor. Only then did he request the assistance of museum staff. \"There are people who touch things in museums regardless of what you do,\" museum director Noel Poirier told NBC Philadelphia. \"Most times, it's adults.

            "Topic: Today is the Day the UN Celebrates Women and Girls in Science. Here’s Why That’s So Important\n",
            "Paragraph: Think on this: What happens to the typical man with a PhD in science after his wife has their first child? Are his opportunities affected by the status of his home life or gender? Now this: What happens to the typical woman with a PhD in science after she has her first child? Or her second? How do her (mostly male) peers react? Is she allowed extended maternity leave? Flex time? Breast-pumping breaks and days off for comforting sick kids? Is she considered equally in applications for higher-paying jobs and promotions? What if she takes a year or two off—is the gap on her resume counted as experience, or a strike against her? If she applies for a research grant, will she get it? Today, February 11, is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This is the first such commemorative day dedicated to asking these questions and coming up with solutions to a problem that affects communities from the wealthiest, most urbane settings to the poorest corners of the globe. In place after place, women and girls are lagging behind their male counterparts in the sciences. A quick look at the stats shows why the international community so urgently needs to do a better job of promoting women in science. A Global Problem Worldwide, women account for just 28 percent of all researchers. Even though enrollment numbers are up and more women are studying science, they’re not matching their male counterparts with PhDs and jobs with critical decision-making clout. And we cannot assume the status quo will gradually change over time as more of those women graduate with degrees in science, technology and engineering. \"Gaps and barriers persist throughout the scientific research system,\" notes a flagship UNESCO science report on this issue titled, Towards 2030. Even in Europe and the United States, the numbers of women in positions of \"leadership and prestige\" remain stagnant despite a decade-long push for change. \"Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left,\" the report says. Reasons cited include a host of cultural phenomena: the maternal wall or glass ceiling, lack of recognition and support for women in leadership, and bias—both conscious and subconscious. The latter is particularly pernicious and difficult to change. \"Science remains one of the few sectors where gender bias is common and considered acceptable by some,\" according to UNESCO. There is a persistent underlying belief that women simply cannot do science as well as men—or that they are overly emotional and distracting to men. When women are missing from classrooms and research labs, they are less likely to be invited to research councils, think tanks, and the editorial boards of scholarly journals. They will not move up to political forums and roundtables of global policymaking. The UN decided to set aside one day—Feb. 11—each year to promote women in science because it is critical to the future of humanity, and this planet. This is not just about do-good, feel-good morality goals; it’s about health and prosperity, life and death. In countries where women and girls are denied education, child and maternal death rates are higher. But when women are educated and included in decision-making circles—in the family, the village, the country—economies grow and mortality rates decline. Take, for example, climate change. As a whole, women suffer the effects of climate change more than men. \"Since men tend to enjoy a higher socio-economic status, women are disproportionately affected by droughts, floods and other extreme weather events and marginalized when it comes to making decisions on recovery and adaptation,\" according to UNESCO. Yet not nearly as many women as men work in scientific fields involving climate change adaptation strategies. Not nearly as many women as men have decision-making powers—at home or in the community—to determine the best strategies for family and cultural survival. Participants at last December’s COP21 talks in Paris noted a striking gender imbalance, \"detrimental to taking action to save people from the ravages of climate change.\" Think, for a moment, about daily life in a traditionally patriarchal society. Let’s say you’re a girl in a remote village, somewhere up a mountain in Timor-Leste. You quit school at third or fourth grade because your mother needs your help in the kitchen and field. You marry young, leave your parents, and move into your husband’s home. His family pays a bride price for you, and by your culture’s standards, you essentially belong to him. You are \"not independent to speak,\" says Rosaria Martins da Cruz, director of HIAM Health, an NGO that fights malnutrition among mothers and kids. Your husband doesn’t want you to get a job, so you don’t. You have no income of your own. You spend your days in the confines of your hut and your land—caring for kids, tending livestock, weeding the garden. As a rural woman, you are \"always in the home to look after the baby, cooking for the man, clean the house, do everything for the man and the kids,\" da Cruz says. Now let’s say it’s an El Niño year (like this one). The rains are late, and drought is expected. Your crops are dying, and people say it’s going to get worse with climate change. You’ve spent the money from last year’s harvest. There is only a little rice to eat, with a few chiles and greens. You feed your husband first. You feed your baby a mush of bland white rice, nothing else. You eat the last dregs yourself, after the others have finished—because that’s tradition, that’s your place in the family. You know it’s not enough nourishment for any of you. You know you’re all getting weaker. You go to church, you pray for rain. When it doesn’t come, sickness does. The neighbor’s baby dies. Then the old woman up the road does, too. You attend each funeral, and go to bed wishing you had the knowledge to make things better, wishing you knew where to begin. The next morning, you wake before dawn to fetch the water, you light the fire, and your daily routine repeats. This is what it’s like for millions of rural women worldwide who are neither asked nor granted the opportunity to study, to leave the village, to learn and then return to make things better. When women are excluded from education and the pursuit of dreams, their communities are denied 50 percent of all opportunity to innovate and grow. For many women around the globe, their gender presents a double burden: they are born into the lowest rungs of society, and their culture keeps them there with little chance to advance. This is something we all must work to change, in our homes and our communities—from Timor-Leste to the United States and beyond. We need Feb. 11 as a start to promote women and girls in science. But even more, we need women and girls in science every day, all year long. Reporting from Timor-Leste was supported by a fellowship through the International Reporting Project.

            "Paragraph: If you're going through a tumultuous breakup and your otherwise hostile ex insists on \"being friends,\" science is here to give you a little tough love: Run in the opposite direction. According to a new study, some people with the so-called \"dark triad\" personality traits -- like narcissism and psychopathy -- keep their exes around for strategic, self serving reasons. Previous research and expert analysis suggests that individuals with dark personality traits like psychopathy engage in behaviors and relationships that are beneficial for their personal gain. Researchers from Oakland University wanted see if this theory also applied to connections with former partners. In the first part of their study, the researchers asked more than 300 participants to name reasons why they would want to be friends with an ex. Then, they narrowed these reasons down to seven concrete categories, such as \"reliability/sentimentality,\" \"pragmatism,\" and \"sexual access.\" The researchers assigned high scores to positive categories (like a former partner was \"reliable, trustworthy and of sentimental value\"), and lower scores to more negative categories (practicality and sexual access). Then, for the second experiment, they gave the list of seven categories to approximately 500 new participants, and asked each of them to rank the categories in order of personal importance to them. These new participants were also given clinical assessments that measured their prevalence of dark personality traits. The results revealed, unsurprisingly, that highly ranking a practical reason for remaining friends with an ex predicted a clinical assessment of narcissism or psychopathy. The findings \"suggest that [a post-relationship friendship] may provide opportunity for ex-partners to exchange desirable resources (e.g., love, status, information, money, sex) after romantic relationship dissolution,\" the study authors wrote in their conclusion. Translation: Not everyone's post-breakup intentions are pure -- particularly if they have dark personalities. It's not a bad idea to proceed with caution when it comes to an ex. The findings offer some fascinating insight on human relationships, specifically when it comes to emotional turmoil. Experts say that maintaining a relationship after a falling out is difficult, especially because -- surprise! -- ulterior motives may be at play. \"[Exes] are less emotionally supportive, less helpful, less trusting, and less concerned about the other person’s happiness,\" Juliana Breines, a social experience researcher and postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University, wrote in a Psychology Today blog. \"This is especially true, not surprisingly, for former partners who were dissatisfied with the romantic relationship, and in cases when the break-up was not mutual.\" That isn't to say that all exes are terrible people only using you for their pleasure. It is very possible to have a cordial relationship with a former partner. The basic takeaway here is, if it doesn't feel like a real friendship to you, or things ended badly, there could be a less-than-kosher reason your ex tries to maintain the connection.\n",

            "Paragraph: An insurance company posted a video on YouTube that had people as far away as Australia crying \"happy tears.\" The video told the story of Joe and Beverly Smith’s special relationship with a classic vehicle. When high school sweethearts Joe and Beverly got married, they were just 19 years old. As they drove away from the church in their 1948 Plymouth convertible, they looked forward to what the future would bring. For the Smiths, the future brought the threat of war. Joe ended up being drafted and going to fight on the Korean peninsula during the Korean War in the 1950s. When Joe came back, the Smiths started their lives. Joe and Beverly started a family and Joe eventually owned his own car dealership. When Joe and Beverly would talk about the past with their kids, one thing that always came up was the 1948 Plymouth convertible. Joe and Beverly had had to sell it when Joe went off to war, but it was still a source of happy memories. Realizing how much the car meant to them and with their 60th anniversary coming up, the Smith's son Joel decided that a 1948 Plymouth convertible would be the perfect gift. Joel scoured the Internet to see if anyone was selling one of the antique cars. He said he only found four for sale. The one he ended up purchasing belonged to an elderly man in Indiana. Joel arranged to have the car transported to upstate New York where the Smiths live. With the help of a few family friends, Joel was able to surprise his parents with the car.\n",

            "Topic: 5 mistakes Americans are making with their money\n",
            "Paragraph: Americans have a long way to go when it comes to understanding and managing money. A recent report from the financial literacy center at Champlain College compiled state and national data to assess the big picture when it comes to Americans’ financial behaviors. The results were pretty dismal. Americans across the country are struggling to stick with basic and healthy financial habits, such as saving, reducing debt or paying their bills on time. John Pelletier, director of the financial literacy center at Champlain College, said that even the highest rated states likely have some room for improvement. Here are some of the key areas in which Americans may be making some costly mistakes when it comes to money: Not paying their bills on time. About one in five people have been more than 60 days late in paying their mortgage, credit card or other bills tracked on credit reports, according to the study, suggesting that a substantial share of consumers are struggling to keep up with their bills, Pelletier said. (Researchers looked at a year’s worth of credit data from 2014.) The mistake can have huge implications for other aspects of your finances, potentially damaging your credit score and affecting what you might pay for future loans. Payment history is the No. 1 factor that goes into calculating your FICO score, accounting for 35 percent of the equation. So if you stumble, focus rebuilding a positive track record by paying your bills on time — every bill, every month. Carrying too much credit card debt. Some 63 percent of U.S. consumers use more than 30 percent of their revolving credit, according to the research. Ignoring the guideline can cause damage to your credit score. That’s because the so-called \"credit utilization\" ratio, or the share of credit a person is using, is the second most important factor that goes into determining your FICO score. People who are looking to apply for a mortgage or auto loan should prepare at least six months in advance by reducing the debt load on each card to below that 30 percent threshold. The best approach to keeping your credit card debt in check is to pay the card off in full each month in order to avoid interest charges. If you can’t afford to do that, keeping the balance to below 30 percent of the total available credit can still give lenders the impression that you’re a responsible borrower. Spending too much on housing. About 31 percent of U.S. homeowners were spending at least 30 percent of their income on monthly housing costs in 2014, according to the report. Among renters, 51 percent of them spent at least 30 percent of pay on housing costs that year. A common rule of thumb is to spend no more than a third of your take-home pay on housing to leave room for other financial goals, such as paying down debt, saving and investing.  In some areas, a shortage of affordable rental units makes it difficult for households to keep housing costs down. But any effort to reduce what is typically the largest monthly expense can go a long way to helping you meet other financial goals. Living outside your means. Sixty percent of households said they spend more than their annual income, according to the study. About 60 percent of consumers could not come up with $2,000 to cover an emergency and half of adults said they have no emergency savings at all, according to the survey. That lack of cash can force consumers to turn to more costly options such as payday loans when unexpected costs come up.  \"If you don’t have an emergency fund, it can put you in a horrible cycle that can be hard to get out of,\" Pelletier said. Tapping their retirement accounts early. About 10.5 percent of Americans said they have taken a hardship withdrawal from their retirement accounts, according to the report. Some methods of accessing retirement funds, such as loans, need to be paid back with interest. But the move can still slow savers. For instance, a quarter of savers who took out 401(k) loans between 2007 and 2013 reduced how much they contributed to their retirement accounts, according to a study by Fidelity Investments. It doesn’t help that many workers are not saving enough as it is. Some 54 percent of workers have less than $25,000 saved for retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. About a quarter of workers have less than $1,000 saved. Once those savings run out, retirees will probably be left to rely on Social Security benefits, which may not bring in enough income for many households, Pelletier said.\n",

            "Paragraph: Emerson College is facing an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights in response to three complaints filed in October that claim the school failed to respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. Nicole M. Merhill, a senior civil rights attorney for the Education Department, informed Emerson sophomore Sarah Tedesco of the investigation in a Dec. 23 letter, which was shared with The Huffington Post. Tedesco is one of three students who filed complaints against Emerson. Tedesco said the Boston college took months to begin investigating her assault, and did not provide support for her when she began receiving anonymous threats. She was sexually assaulted by the same individual a second time, Tedesco said, while the college was still investigating her initial report. Emerson junior Jillian Doherty, another complainant, said the college conducted a lackluster investigation of her assault and did not interview witnesses. A third student, junior Sarita Nadkarni, filed a complaint claiming the college did not provide support when she reported a sexual assault, and she later was put on academic probation and threatened with the loss of her scholarship. The OCR will investigate all three complaints as part of a single review. \"While we have not yet seen the official notification, we look forward to cooperating with the Office for Civil Rights in pursuit of best practices,\" said Andy Tiedemann, Emerson's vice president for communications and marketing. According to the letter, the federal agency will review whether Emerson \"adopted and published grievance procedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution\" of sexual assault and harassment complaints, and how well the college responds to sexual violence complaints it receives. \"We will be requesting documents from the College and may conduct an onsite to interview College staff,\" Merhill said in the letter. \"We are also of course interested in reviewing any documents you may wish to provide, as well as interviewing any individuals with whom you would like us to speak.\" The college joins nearly three dozen higher education institutions being reviewed by OCR under Title IX, the federal gender equity law. The Education Department faced an unprecedented wave of complaints in 2013 from students and recent alumni about how colleges have responded to sexual assaults on campus. Emerson President M. Lee Pelton promised after the first complaint was filed that the college would review and improve its policies on sexual violence.\n",

            "Paragraph: To most Westerners, the world of K-pop stars (especially the dudes) looks understandably ridiculous. But hey, we don’t judge people on looks and cultural differences. Instead, we judge them by how much money they make — and damn, we never could have guessed that ultra-feminine boys in eyeliner made this much money. The three major K-pop labels — SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment — have reported record profits this year. Their clients are the hottest K-pop groups out right now and they each made this much in the first half of 2014: SuperJunior — $28,491,105.00 Girls’ Generation — $27,796,200.00 Big Bang — $26,985,594.00 2NE1 — $25,253,338.00 When those numbers are doubled for a rough yearly total, each group takes away at least $50 million, which includes tours, brand deals, albums and everything else — though that’s still not a lot for a group like SuperJunior, who has to split their nearly $57 million between their inefficient 10-member money-making bandwagon. No, it’s not quite Beyonce or Bieber money, who raked in $115 million and $80 million respectively in 2014, but the top K-pop groups earned more than stars like Rihanna ($48 million), Katy Perry ($40 million), Jennifer Lopez ($37 million), Miley Cyrus ($36 million) and almost as much as Taylor Swift ($64 million). But before you decide to pack up and move to South Korea, slap on some mascara and join a boy band (also applies for girl bands), those millions really only belong to the most successful groups. Even though they are making more money every year, the average take-home for K-pop groups is $42,940.91. If you didn’t know that K-pop stars are pretty baller, now you do. You’re welcome.\n",

            "Paragraph: If your company only offers a 401(k), health insurance and a flexible vacation schedule, then you're missing out on the hottest employee benefit of 2017: student loan repayment assistance. To attract and retain millennials, in particular, companies are expanding their employee benefit programs to help reduce student loan debt for their employees. Millennials are heeding the call. Aetna is one of 10 trailblazing companies offering the hottest employee benefit of 2017. (AP Photo/Jessica Hill) In the 2015 American Student Assistance survey, 76% of respondents said that if a prospective employer offered a student loan repayment benefit, it would be a deciding or contributing factor to accept the job. While only 4% of companies currently offer such a benefit, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, and employees are typically responsible for income taxes on the assistance received, expect this percentage to increase in the coming year. Here are 10 trailblazing companies that will help you pay off your student loans faster in 2017: 1. Fidelity Employees at the manager level and below of this leading financial services company are eligible to receive up to $2,000 per year (up to $10,000 total) toward repayment of their student loans. The Step Ahead Student Loan Assistance benefit also provides employees with online tools to help them better manage their student loan debt. Fidelity estimates that approximately 25% of its employees have student loan debt. Fidelity uses the assistance of a third party employee benefit platform, Tuition.io, to send payments directly to each employee's lender. Another positive: since the student loan benefit is paid monthly, an employee who leaves Fidelity does not have to repay the benefit. 2. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) The global accounting and consulting firm offers associates and senior associates up to $1,200 per year up to $7,200 toward an employee's student loan debt. PwC is working with Gradifi, an employee benefit platform, to assist with its student loan repayment plan. 3. Aetna This healthcare company offers up to $2,000 in matching student loan payments (up to $10,000) for full-time employees and $1,000 (up to $5,000) for part-time employees. To qualify, an employee must have earned an undergraduate or graduate degree within three years of applying for the program. 4. Penguin Random House Penguin Random House is the first book publishing company to offer student loan repayment assistance. Penguin Random House will pay $1,200 per year (up to $9,000) in student loan repayment benefits for any full-time employee who has worked at the company at least one year. Gradifi is administering the student loan benefit. 5. Natixis  The global asset management company offers $1,000 per year (up to $10,000) to any full-time employee with a federal or private student loan. Today's student loan burden is tomorrow's underfunded retirement problem, so it is imperative for companies to join with policymakers, educators and employees to address this critical issue, said John Hailer, CEO of Natixis Global Asset Management in the Americas and Asia, in a statement. 6. Nvidia The technology company offers its full-time and part-time employees up to $6,000 per year (up to $30,000) in student loan repayment benefits. Nvidia will pay the lesser of $500 and the employee's required total monthly student loan payment amount. The program covers both federal and private loans. To be eligible, employees must work at the company for at least three months and have graduated within the last three years. 7. First Republic The private bank and wealth management company provides its employees with a tiered student loan repayment benefit. During the employee's first year of employment, the employee receives $1,200 toward student loan repayment. During the second year, the student loan repayment benefit increases to $1,800. Thereafter, the student loan repayment benefit increases to $2,400 per year. There is no lifetime cap on the student loan repayment benefit. Both full-time and part-time employees are eligible, as are employees who have borrowed an educational loan on behalf of their child. 8. Chegg The education and technology company offers both full-time and part-time employees up to $1,000 annually to help repay their student loans. There is no cap on the amount of student loan repayment that employees can receive. Like Fidelity, Chegg partnered with Tuition.io to administer the student loan repayment benefit. 9. Powertex Group The design company offers its employees $1,200 per year to repay their student loans, and expects approximately 25% of its employees to enroll in the program. Like PwC and Penguin Random House, Powertex is working with Gradifi to administer the benefit. 10. Staples The retailer helps full-time sales associates repay their student loans with $1,200 per year (up to $3,600). Expect this benefit to spread to other companies that want to recruit and retain a loyal employee base. It's employee-centric. It's forward-thinking. It's solution-oriented. And it's one step in the right direction to help address a $1.3 trillion issue affecting over 40 million borrowers.\n",

            "Paragraph: WASHINGTON -- In September, Rep. Trey Radel voted for Republican legislation that would allow states to make food stamp recipients pee in cups to prove they're not on drugs. In October, police busted the Florida Republican on a charge of cocaine possession. \"It’s really interesting it came on the heels of Republicans voting on everyone who had access to food stamps get drug tested,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told BuzzFeed Tuesday. \"It’s like, what?\" The House over the summer approved an amendment by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) that would let states drug test people on food stamps. The amendment passed by voice vote, meaning members' individual yeas and nays were not recorded. Radel later voted in favor of a broader food stamps bill that included Hudson's measure. In support of his drug testing legislation, Hudson cited the many state legislatures around the country that had considered similar requirements for other means-tested programs in recent years. \"This is a clear and obvious problem in our communities as nearly 30 states have introduced legislation to drug test for welfare programs,\" Hudson said. \"We have a moral obligation to equip the states with the tools they need to discourage the use of illegal drugs.\" Most of the state legislation was authored by Republicans. Oftentimes, state Democrats responded by suggesting lawmakers should be subject to tests as well. If the government's going to make sure recipients of taxpayer-funded benefits are clean, the argument went, then why not also make sure the recipients of taxpayer salaries are clean, too? In June, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) made that very suggestion when he questioned why recipients of crop insurance and other government benefits weren't also targeted for drug tests like people on food stamps. \"Why don't we drug test all the members of Congress here,\" McGovern said shortly before the drug-testing measure passed. \"Force everybody to go urinate in a cup or see whether or not anybody is on drugs? Maybe that will explain why some of these amendments are coming up or why some of the votes are turning out the way they are.\" The fate of the food stamp drug testing provision is in the hands of a House-Senate conference committee hashing out differences between food stamp and farm legislation that passed the two chambers. It's got a chance. Last year, Congress passed a law to let states drug-test some unemployment insurance recipients. Radel apologized Tuesday for his cocaine bust and said he'd seek treatment. \"I struggle with the disease of alcoholism, and this led to an extremely irresponsible choice,\" he said.\n",

            "Paragraph: Ever wonder what those floaty things in your eyes are? Well, the folks at TED-Ed have an explanation, broken down into understandable terms that anyone — and not just those with biology degrees — can understand. First things first, floaters (scientific name: Muscae volitantes) aren't typically a cause for concern. Floaters only exist in your eyeball, not in the external world. And though they appear to wander in the direction that your eye does, they aren't alive by any means. So what are they? Inside your eyeball, there is a gel known as vitreous humour. Over time, the constituents of the vitreous humour break down and drift away, hence the name \"floaters.\" According to TED-Ed, floaters may be bits of protein or tissue, or perhaps red blood cells. These fragments \"cast shadows on the retina,\" and thus, when they're closer to the retina, the stronger the shadow will be. According to All About Vision , floaters will appear more defined when you're looking at a bright backdrop, like a blue sky or a computer screen. In the TED-Ed video, they also discuss the blue field entoptic phenomenon. Ever look at the sky and start to see small dots in your vision? Those small, darting dots are the result of white blood cells moving around the capillaries. Though this phenomenon is unrelated to floaters, it's equally fascinating.\n",

            "Paragraph: The Big Short isn't for the faint of heart. The comedy-drama hybrid about the housing crisis and financial crash of 2008 isn't for the faint of heart. The comedy-drama hybrid about the housing crisis and financial crash of 2008 starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt , is certain to have people talking. Based on the book by Michael Lewis, The Big Short tells the true story of a group of men — some Wall Street bankers, some not — who decided to flip the script and bet against the housing market before the crash. The film, which repeatedly breaks the fourth wall, looks larger than life, but all the big name stars in the film play characters based on real people, including Pitt, who stars as retired banker Ben Rickert. Rickert is actually based on Ben Hockett, a banker who joined forces with his neighbors Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley in establishing Cornwall Capital Management, an investment fund that struck gold with their bets against the housing market. So, what does the real Ben think of The Big Short Hockett hasn't spoken out about the film yet, so it's unclear how he feels about being immortalized on film and I'm not sure we'll ever know his take because the real Hockett has kept his distance from the spotlight, and is now a survivalist living a quiet life in Berkeley, Calif. According to Pitt's interview with Vulture, Hockett hasn't spoken out about the film yet, so it's unclear how he feels about being immortalized on film and I'm not sure we'll ever know his take because the real Hockett has kept his distance from the spotlight, and is now a survivalist living a quiet life in Berkeley, Calif. According to Pitt's interview with Vulture, Hockett lives in a home that is impossible to access by car . Given Hockett's solitude, I'd wager that it's unlikely he'd approve of being made into a product of Hollywood. It might seem like anybody lucky enough to be played by Pitt in a movie wouldn't have anything to complain about, but, to be fair, Pitt's turn as Ben Rickert in The Big Short isn't the actor's most glamorous turn. Dressed in ill-fitting suits with clear glasses and a grey beard, Pitt embraced the look of a bored professional for the film. Still, despite any makeunders, it's hard to think that Pitt's casting would be a point of contention. It's more likely that Hockett would be concerned with how audiences respond to the character of The Big Short can be seen as a story about underdogs and outcasts who beat the system. This narrative of the regular guy profiting off of the corruption of big banks is certainly how The Big Short is being sold to audiences, as evidenced by the early trailers released for the film. On the other hand, The Big Short is a story about brilliant minds who predicted the housing crash and didn't stop it.

            "Paragraph: The American flag is flown at half staff over the White House last Sunday, after President Obama spoke about the massacre at an Orlando nightclub. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP) Flags across the United States no longer are flying at half-staff in honor of the victims of the Orlando gay nightclub massacre — but residents of one Alabama county won't notice a difference. That's because the official in charge of flag-flying in Baldwin County never lowered them in the first place. \"When the flag is at half-staff, our country’s head is figuratively held low, and quite frankly, I am not willing to hang my head down because of a terrorist attack against our people and our allies,\" Tucker Dorsey, the chairman of the county commission, explained on Facebook. \"I am not willing to hang my head down because evil shoots up a church, school, or movie theater. We need more than a gesture as a response. I want us, as Americans, to stand tall, courageously, and fight back against the forces of evil, and let’s fight like we intend to win.\" Dorsey, a Republican who previously refused to lower county flags after the terrorist killings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., also insisted the U.S. flag code does not include terrorist events or mass shootings among the reasons to lower the flag — despite orders from President Obama and Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley. The refusal set off a spirited debate on Facebook and Twitter that quickly spread nationwide. At first, Dorsey wasn't alone in his defiance. Cole County, Mo., also kept their flags flying high because \"lowering it too much takes away from the honor,\" commissioner Jeff Hoelscher told the Jefferson City News Tribune. But after complaints were made, the commission reversed its decision on Tuesday. USA TODAY reported this week that Obama has ordered flags lowered to half-staff more than any president in history. Since 2009, he has issued 66 proclamations to fly the flag at half-staff, more than President George W. Bush's 58 and President Bill Clinton's 50.\n",

            "Topic: 14 Things You Need To Know About Wolverine’s Claws\n",
            "Paragraph: Everybody knows Wolverine. Almost sixteen years after Hugh Jackman first burst onto the big screen as the centerpiece of Fox’s X-Men cinematic universe, Wolverine has become one of the most famous names in comic books... and he was already pretty famous to begin with! Since his first appearance in 1974, Wolverine has grown to be a fan favorite and a huge part of the Marvel universe as one of its most recognizable faces. Although Logan is known for many things – his temper, his fighting abilities, his interesting hairstyle – his most recognizable feature for most is his claws. His most deadly weapon, these retractable blades have been with Wolvie from the very beginning, but how much do you really know about these unique appendages? Read on for 14 things you might not have known about his weapon of choice... * snikt! 14. His Claws Are Fused With Adamantium Let’s get the obvious out of the way. Starting us off, we have some fairly common knowledge – that Wolverine’s claws, along with the rest of his skeleton, are fused with a metal that only exists in the Marvel universe, known as adamantium. This isn’t part of his mutation, though. His skeleton was fused with the metal courtesy of the Weapon X project , a secret government branch dedicated to weaponizing superpowers. Logan wasn’t the only subject, but he was one of their most successful attempts to build the perfect living weapon. He was the ideal candidate for this because of his natural mutation – his healing factor meant that he would be able to survive the process, something that no one else could. What you may not know is that he also had his memory wiped at the time. This was part of the plan, and put him under the control of the project, programmed to kill for them for some time before he could eventually break free. His escape was also aided by the Winter Soldier – yet another amazing crossover that we won’t see until Marvel and Fox learn to play nice with each other. However, we did see a little bit about this in X-Men: Apocalypse , when Jean Grey released a crazed Weapon X from a bunker. 13. His Claws Are Part of His Bone Structure Although they weren’t always (see: number 8), Wolverine’s claws are now actually fully retractable bone claws. These claws are just a little bit shorter than the rest of his forearm, which allows him bend his arm when they are retracted (despite this, they often appear longer in certain comic panels – this is just artistic license. If the claws were actually longer, they simply wouldn’t fit into his body!). The claws themselves are part of his original mutation, along with his healing factor, heightened senses, increased strength and stamina and animal empathy. Although earlier comics showed them as a Weapon X addition to his body, this has since been retconned. Originally, he had only his healing powers, and Weapon X added the \"claws\" as a weapon when they fused his (much more human) skeleton with adamantium. However, his current origin story shows him with bone claws popping out at a young age. In fact, it was in the 1800s (remember, Wolverine is super old) that his powers first manifested after his father was killed in front of him, and his bone claws first burst out of his fists. It wasn’t until much later that the adamantium was added by the Weapon X project (see: number 14). 12. His Bone Claws Have Been In Three Movies Although he is shown with adamantium claws in most of the comics, and it wasn’t actually until the ‘90s that comic books showed his claws as part of his bone structure, they have still appeared in several of the movies in the X-Men franchise. First, we saw his bone claws in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which went right back to his beginnings in the 1800s, and did a surprisingly good job of staying true to the current comic canon. Here, we saw both his bone claws and how he got his more recognizable adamantium claws when the Weapon X project got their hands on him. Then, they appeared again in the significant solo improvement that was The Wolverine , when the Silver Samurai severed his adamantium claws, and Wolverine was able to regrow his bone claws in time to kill Yashida. Interestingly, this wouldn’t actually happen like this in the comics, where he regrows his skeleton with the adamantium attached (his mutation adapted to be able to do this). 11. Real-Life Wolverine Claws Exist OK, not true real-life claws that actually exist as a retractable part of a skeleton. Replica claws in various forms do exist though, as fans and cosplayers have made multiple variations on the iconic weapon for fun. Most of these are either sewn into gloves (like Wolverine’s very first claws in the comics!), or include a base/handle that has to be held for the claws to poke out between the wearer’s knuckles. However, these are rarely retractable, which is why you will see cosplayers wandering the convention floor with claws out at all times – it’s just simpler to create replica claws that don’t have to move. However, one YouTuber and inventor, Colin Furze, has created a set of fully retractable, wearable claws ! The claws are attached to wrist gauntlets and a pneumatic apparatus on his back, and by squeezing a button in his hand, he can extend and retract them at will. They even spark when they hit each other. Awesome! The backpack that holds the pneumatic equipment can fit under a coat, too. Sadly, they aren’t actually made of actual adamantium, though. These aren’t the only replicas Colin Furze has made, either. He’s also made a Pyro wrist-mounted flamethrower, Magento-inspired magnetic boots to allow him to walk on the ceiling, and many more film-based gadgets. 10. He Has A Comic Mini-Series Titled ‘Claws’ While it’s not technically about his claws, this certainly features them heavily! In 2006, Marvel published a short miniseries starring Wolverine entitled Wolverine & The Black Cat: Claws starring Logan and Felicia Hardy (more commonly found in the pages of Spider-Man comics). The story follows Wolverine and Black Cat (another character with sharp claws, although hers are in her gloves) as they were kidnapped to be hunted for sport. The series also featured Arcade and his girlfriend White Rabbit, along with a few other name drops (including Emma Frost). Put together by Joe Linsner (known for Dawn and Sinful Suzi), Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, the series is a fun (and still bloody!) break from Wolverine’s regular scheduled programming. It was also popular enough to warrant a sequel. In 2011, the pair picked up where they left off with the (imaginatively titled) follow-up Wolverine & The Black Cat: Claws 2, in which their kidnappers return and Wolverine and Black Cat end up transported to an alternate future. Combining these two favorite clawed characters led to romance, but Felicia Hardy is only one of Logan’s many (many) love interests over the years, and a very minor one at that. Still, it’s a sweet two-part story for the pair. 9. His Claws Hurt Not simply having them, of course, but releasing his claws is actually painful for Wolverine. It’s because his mutation doesn’t affect the pain that he feels – part of his mutation are the claws themselves, and the other part is his ability to heal inhumanly fast. (There are more elements to his mutation, of course – the enhanced speed, strength, agility and animal instincts that give him the name Wolverine. However, those are not directly related to his claws.) When the claws shoot out, they are actually slicing through the skin on his hands – we just don’t usually see it because his healing factor takes care of those minor injuries almost immediately. He also is a complete bad-ass, and not the type to stop and whimper about how much it hurts when he is seconds away from kicking some ass. That doesn’t stop him feeling the pain at the moment that they break the skin, though. However, when his healing factor has been weakened in the past, he’s been shown bleeding and in extreme pain when his claws come out (such as in \"Fatal Attractions\"). This may be why he tends to just use his claws as weapons, rather than as, say, can openers. Ouch! 8. They Weren’t Always Claws Although we now know that Wolverine’s claws are actually part of his bone structure (and that he has always had them), they weren’t intended that way from the start. In fact, his original creators Len Wein (writer) and John Romita (artist) intended for them to be part of his suit when he was first conceived in the 1970s. In early drawings, his claws are drawn to appear to be coming out of his gloves. They also extend from his wrists, rather than between his knuckles, which makes less sense from an anatomical perspective. On top of all that, several storylines backed up the idea that the claws were not a part of his mutant abilities. However, this was later retconned, and it was officially revealed that the claws were part of his body in the Official Marvel Handbook. Published in the ‘80s, the book included a description and diagram of Wolverine’s skeletal structure, showing the claws as \"pure adamantium\" added to his skeleton. At this point, however the claws were still considered to be an addition to his body, thanks to the Weapon X Project. It wasn’t until 1993 that they were shown to actually be part of his skeleton, after Magneto ripped the adamantium out of his body. (More on that later.) 7. His Claws Were Re-designed For The Wolverine Wolverine and his claws have appeared in almost every single X-Men movie (although he didn’t pop the claws in his cameo in X-Men: First Class), but they haven’t actually been the same claws every time. In the earlier X-Men movies (X-Men, X2, X-Men: The Last Stand, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine), Hugh Jackman wore prop claws that were straight, with only a slight curve at the end to give them a pointed tip. These were re-designed for his second solo adventure, The Wolverine. The new claws were given sharper angles along the sides and toward the end, a change that isn’t immediately apparent, but which can be seen if you look at stills from the films side by side. This change was made so that the claws would catch the light more effectively when filming (otherwise known as \"looking cooler\"). As well as the shape change, the new claws came out of a different part of Hugh Jackman’s hand. They were moved slightly lower and closer to the palm, which was done to make them more anatomically accurate. If the claws were real, and were retractable back into the forearm, they would come out lower down between the knuckles. The original film claws came out a little too high up to be as realistic as the new design. 6. They Almost Never Need Sharpening As bone claws, Wolverine would have sharpened his natural weaponry the same way that animals do – through simple use. In some animals (such as small cats), an outer layer of the claw is shed, which would be an interesting concept for Wolverine – leaving foot-long claw husks all over the X-Mansion! However, his adamantium claws are razor sharp, and appear as blades that rarely, if ever, need sharpening. This is primarily because of the strength of the adamantium – because they are so much harder than anything he is using them against, they simply don’t get dull enough to need a whole lot of maintenance (especially as he is commonly using them against the softness of human flesh). However, he has been seen to sharpen his claws on occasion, usually against his other claws – although this seems to be more of a habit to get him geared up for an oncoming fight, as blades are usually sharpened by running them against a harder material in order to grind the edge. Presumably, Wolverine would be able to sharpen his claws against a grindstone if he really needed to – or he could cut off his arm and re-grow brand new claws, although that seems a little more extreme! 5. He Can Retract His Claws Individually Although Wolverine usually releases all three of his claws on each hand at the same time, he doesn’t actually have to. The reason that we usually only see him with all claws either retracted or unsheathed has to do primarily with the fact that it hurts to pop ‘em out (as we saw in number 9). Because of this, Wolverine doesn’t bust out the claws casually, but only when he needs to fight. And in a fight, six claws can do significantly more damage than just one. However, he has been shown in the comics to only unsheathe the claws on one hand at a time, or to have each of his three claws out to a different length (very useful for pinning someone down and threatening them with the same hand!). Presumably, the claws are retracted using his muscles, and extending a single claw is no more complicated than extending one finger while the others are bent. He has even used a single claw to give people his own special version of the finger (or to reveal to Twitter fans how many more movies Wolverine will be in...). That one is a little more of a rarity though, as shooting his claws out is actually pretty darn painful, and not something he is likely to do just to show how annoyed he is at someone. Unless it’s Cyclops 4. He Can Re-Grow His Claws On the very rare occasion that someone was able to snap off one of his claws (see number 3 for why that’s unlikely), he would be able to grow it back, lizard-with-a-tail style. At least, he would in his most recent incarnations (obviously ignoring the fact that he is currently dead in the comics ). When Wolverine first appeared in the comics, his powers weren’t quite as developed as they are now, and had someone managed to rip out a claw, it may not have regenerated. Now, although Wolverine’s healing ability was initially not quite powerful enough to regrow whole limbs, as the character developed, so did his powers. This is a common occurrence in comic books – characters often become more powerful the longer they exist, to keep things interesting for the readers and allow them to take on stronger villains. In recent years, Wolverine’s healing factor has become so powerful that he has been able to come back from almost total destruction, although the more severe the injury, the longer it would take to recover completely. In The Wolverine, he regrows bone claws when they are cut off, reverting to his original anatomy. However, because his skeleton is made of adamantium-beta, which has adapted to fuse the metal with his biology he would actually most likely regrow them as adamantium. 3. They Are (Almost) Unbreakable and Cannot Be Removed As almost the strongest metal in the Marvel universe, it’s nearly impossible to break one of Wolverine’s claws, which is one of the reasons that he is so deadly. It’s also been suggested in certain storylines that the adamantium that is fused with his skeleton has also begun to connect to his tendons, making it impossible to simply rip one of the claws out of the (comparatively) weaker surrounding tissue. He can essentially never be disarmed. However, there have been one or two times where someone has managed to come close. In an alternate universe, Gladiator did manage to pull one of his claws out (in Wolverine v Gladiator: Galactic Guardians #1), and in the main Marvelverse, Steve Rogers was able to apply so much force to Wolverine’s arms that he could force them to retract. Magneto took a slightly different tack in Fatal Attractions, when he used his mutant power to rip the adamantium out of Wolverine’s body in one of the most brutal panels in either character’s history. Technically, it didn’t actually get rid of the claws completely (he just regrew them, along with the rest of his skeleton), but it certainly took him down for a while. Finally, in Fox’s X-Men franchise , the Silver Samurai manages to sever his claws with adamantium swords. 2. His Claws Aren’t True Adamantium Yes, the first entry on this list stated that the claws are adamantium, but there are actually several different kinds of adamantium in the Marvel comic universe, although they are rarely differentiated. True Adamantium was originally created by Dr. Myron Maclain in the 1940s, although not even he knows exactly how he did it, as he fell asleep at his workbench and woke up to find it mysteriously bonded together! The component parts are still a closely guarded government secret. The metal was created in an attempt to duplicate the metal used to create Captain America’s shield, and True Adamantium is one of the strongest metals on earth. It’s also ruinously expensive and almost impossible to synthesize, which led to the creation of a slightly weaker form, Secondary Adamantium. Although this is easier, it’s still expensive and complicated, which is why there isn’t more adamantium weaponry in the Marvel Universe. Finally, Wolverine’s skeleton contains a third form of the metal: Adamantium Beta. Adamantium Beta is a result of Wolverine’s healing factor altering the molecular structure of the metal so that it acts as a part of his body. This allows him to regenerate adamantium parts, and prevents the adamantium from interfering with his body’s processes (such as his bone marrow and healing). 1. His Claws Aren’t Stronger Than Cap’s Shield One of the biggest questions for fans of both Fox’s X-Men franchise and the MCU is, which would be stronger – Wolverine’s claws or Captain America’s shield ? The answer is (like most things in the comic-verse), complicated. Wolverine’s skeleton was originally reinforced with True Adamantium, but became altered by his healing factor to become Beta Adamantium (see number 2), whereas Captain America’s shield is made of Proto Adamantium – an alloy of True Adamantium and Vibranium. Proto Adamantium is the strongest metal in existence in the Marvel-verse, so Wolverine’s claws could not damage it. This makes Cap’s shield one of the very (very) few things in the Marvel Universe that cannot be cut by Wolverine’s claws, no matter how much pressure he puts behind it. The two have even duked it out, and Wolverine’s claws slid off the shield (with what we can only imagine was a sound ten times worse than nails on a blackboard!). However, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe , Cap’s shield is made out of pure vibranium (presumably because Fox has the rights to adamantium), and Wolverine’s claws are described only as \"adamantium,\" without all the detail of the comics. Therefore, if the film universes were ever to come together, Wolverine’s claws could potentially be stronger than the shield. We’ll just have to wait for a rights-sharing deal to find the answer to that one out!\n",

            "Topic: 15 Cheap Beauty Products That Are Worth Buying In 2017\n",
            "Paragraph: Tried and tested by us. We spent a lot of 2016 trying out beauty products. Some of them were really good, some not so much. So here is a list of the beauty products that we swear by. 1. L.A.B.2 Lash Out Loud Mascara Wands , £5.50 The L.A.B.⊃2; Lash Out Loud Mascara Wands is a collection of 12 disposable wands with four different brush styles. Each brush is designed to either volumise, lengthen, define, or curl the lashes. Emma says: \"These were great! I could definitely see a difference between the eye with just my normal mascara wand and the eye I used the separate wands for. I like that you can choose which effect you want, and the defining brush is super useful for fixing clumping.\" 2. Topshop Glow Stick, £9 The Glow Stick is a twist-up highlighter stick that’s meant to sculpt, define, and enhance the skin. Emma says: \"I loved this product. It was easy to blend, and it was shimmery without being too shimmery.\" 3. NYX Concealer Jar, £5.50 This is a full-coverage concealer that’s meant to hide dark circles and blemishes. Tolani says: \"Yeah, this shit is magical, no doubt about it. This is one of the best concealers I have ever used. I am so upset that I have been spending £17.50 on the Benefit Boi-ing concealer when this £5.50 gem exists. I am wearing the nutmeg shade and it is the perfect shade for me. It conceals very well, it doesn’t feel heavy, and it’s just so good. A little tip: It seems to apply better when dabbed on with a fingertip rather than a sponge.\" 4. Real Techniques Setting Brush, £6.99 This setting brush is great for setting highlight powders and creams – it allows you to gain some control when dusting powder on your face. Tolani says: \"I like this brush. It’s super soft and sets powder highlight beautifully and naturally – it literally just buffs it in. I love the shape and size of the brush. It’s small enough to set my under-eye makeup, and it can also be used for contouring. It’s really soft on my skin, and it doesn’t waste any product. The only downside is that it took a little while to really blend the product into my skin, but apart from that, I love this.\" 5. NYX Wicked Lippies, £5.50 NYX Wicked Lippies is a range of jewel-toned metallic shades. If you’re into bright-coloured lipsticks, this is definitely for you. Emma says: \"This formula is great! It slipped on really well and the colour payoff was good. I liked it a lot. Also, the more I wore the blue lipstick, the more I liked it. I don’t think I can pull off super bright/unusual lipstick colours, but this made me feel like maybe I could!\" Tolani says: \"NYX lipsticks are always really good, and this range is just as good as all the others. The formula is EVERYTHING. I just don’t think I can get away with this colour.\" Tolani is wearing the Risque shade and Emma is wearing the Envy shade. 6. Kiko Finish Line Lipstick, £3.90 It’s a £3.90 lipstick that looks amazing on. Both Tolani and Emma are really into the colour and the moisturising formula. It glides along your lips smoothly and stays on all day. The formula is creamy and although the finish is matte, your lips feel very much moisturised. The colour payoff wasn’t amaaaazing – we needed about three coats to really see the colour – but for this price it was great. 7. Golden Monkey Glamour Lip Kit, £8.50 The contents of this really cute packaging are meant to transform chapped lips and make them really soft and supple. You have to follow three steps, and it will take around 30 to 40 minutes, so it’s worth finding something to entertain yourself with. The first step is a pad that’s meant to lightly exfoliate dead skin while nourishing your lips. The second step is a mask that soothes your lips. It includes shea butter and jojoba seed oil, which are both really key ingredients when it comes to soothing.The final step is a luxe lip oil that feels like a really fancy lip balm. Emma says: \"They were great. Looking ridiculous was really worth it. My lips felt very moisturised and plumped-up.\" 8. Sleek Colour Corrector Palette, £7.99 This colour-correcting palette comes in six different colours that are meant to work on different skin tones and \"problem\" areas. Green: Helps with redness and is meant to be ideal for concealing scars and blemishes. Lilac: Meant for brightening sallow, dull complexions. Blue: Neutralises orange, which is apparently good for concealing freckles. Rose: Adds radiance and evens out dark sports. Yellow: Helps to conceal under-eye circles on light skin tones. Orange: Conceals dark circles on dark skin tones. Tolani says: \"While all the colours in the palette were not for me, I think that it’s great that the one palette sees to most skin tones. I used the rose and orange colours and I think it really works. I’m also really into how easy it was to cover up. I would definitely use it again.\" 9. NYX Curve Liner, £12 What’s really cool about this eyeliner is the shape. The curve is meant to make holding the liner easier so you can apply it better. Tolani says: \"Gosh, this might be the best eyeliner I have ever used. It’s so bloody good. The shape of the eyeliner really makes a difference. It’s really easy to hold and the formula glides on so well. So yes, £12 is a little steep for eyeliner, but it is really worth the money.\" 10. H&M Nail Polish, £3.99 Tolani says: \"This nail polish is as good as, if not better than, any name-brand nail polish I have tried. The colours are amazing, the brush is perfectly thick, and it’s really easy to apply. The polish lasted four days before it started to chip, and that was without topcoat.\" 11. Kiko Eye Base Primer, £7.90 The primer promises to keep eyeshadow in place for longer, make application easier, and brighten up eyeshadow. It has a shimmery base to it, and comes out very pearlescent when applied. We both loved this product so much. The primer actually makes the eyeshadow look better and stay longer. 12. Rimmel Professional Eyebrow Pencil, £2.99 Tolani says: \"This pen worked wonders on my brows, and it’s just as good as any other brow kits I have tried. I really like it. I am sold and will definitely be using this from now on – it does the exact same job as my MAC Eyebrow Pencil, which costs £14.\" 13. Collection Fast Stroke Eyeliner, £2.99 This eyeliner gets top marks and it’s only £2.99. It’s super easy to use and the precision you get with it is just amazing. 14. Fleur De Force By Eylure – Fleur Loves Lashes, £5.25 Tolani says: \"These lashes are more of a corner lash than a full-strip lash, and I’m really into them. These were really easy to apply and just kinda fell into place, with the help of tweezers of course. They are subtle enough to wear all day, and I really like the feline flick they give.\" 15. Sleek MakeUp True Colour Lipstick, £4.99 YES to colour, YES to pigment, yes to everything about this lipstick. Not only does it literally slide along your lips, the colours are vibrant AF and it stayed on the whole day, even after lunch. The range comes in 21 different shades and you can get both matte and sheer textures.\n",

            "Paragraph: Today I did something I never did before — I ‘defriended’ someone who chastised me in a letter about how offended she was by \"Trumped Up Cards,\" and how she wanted me to know she was voting for Trump. This was not a fb friend, but someone who subscribes to my website newsletter ( christinelavin.com ). So I told her a true story I’ve known about Trump since 1994. An actor friend of mine worked for a caterer in 1993. It was a new caterer, and this caterer was thrilled to land the kind of job that can really boost a career — catering Donald Trump and Marla Maples wedding. At the time she wondered why he didn’t hire other caterers he’d used in the past, but just thanked her lucky stars he hired her. Everything went beautifully — the food was a hit, the waiters/waitresses all were totally professional. Everything was first rate. Donald Trump refused to pay the bill. He told the caterer, \"I know you are new at this, and when you tell people you catered MY wedding, you will get more business than you could ever dream of. So I am doing you a favor. And when I do favors, I don’t pay. End of discussion.\" She couldn’t believe it — she sent numerous bills — ignored. She threatened to sue — he said \"Go ahead. I don’t lose in court.\" She explored suing, but came away knowing it would cost her high legal bills, and wouldn’t be worth it. After more than six months of his stonewalling she ended up paying her staff out of her own pocket, though couldn’t pay them fully or she’d be out of business. So Trump stiffed not only her, but her staff, her chefs, her busboys. This is not a story I recently heard — it’s one I heard 22 years ago. We know many stories like this now. The woman who wrote to me today said, \"I know you have a big heart and won’t hold it against me, but I wanted you to know I’m 100% for Trump.\" I wrote back, \"I may have a big heart, but it’s not that big. Goodbye.\" Should she write back to chastise me more, her email will go straight to the trash where it belongs. Anybody reading this offended? Please let me know.

            "Topic: 7 Dangerous Anti-Feminist Groups You Should Know About\n",
            "Paragraph: With all its anti-lady and anti-LGBT opinions turned into official policies, The Republican National Convention has come and gone. But as the most powerful voices opposing progress for ladies rear their ugly heads, it's time we all got familiar with some of the scariest groups railing against women. While each of these groups have distinct ideologies and varying amounts of violence, there's certainly some overlap between them all. Women and queers beware, here are some trolls to watch out for, because they're not hiding under bridges anymore: 1. Gamergate Swatting, What may have started out as a debate on ethics in video game journalism quickly turned into an organized syndicate of virulently anti-women harassers. Composed largely of male video game players, the group organized around harassing women in the video game industry like Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu , as well as cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian . While the group claims to be concerned with rooting out corruption in entertainment media, it has since become explicitly clear that they largely exist to terrorize female video gamers and video game creators as a political statement against cultural diversification and liberal social criticisms of media. They often resort to frightening and aggressive tactics including doxing calling in bomb threats to events , and stalking. 2. The Alt-Right reversal of Roe V. Wade and regularly oppose equal pay for women, weren't bad enough! The internet has spawned a new breed of young extremists who have labeled themselves the alt-right. With openly gay troll Milo Yiannopoulos leading the group, the alt-right advocate a new kind of libertarianism that includes within it extremely violent misogynistic, pro-gun, and racist rhetoric. Largely young and extremely loud, the group has gotten behind Trump and tend to proliferate their ideas through hateful internet memes and social media nastiness.

Men's Rights Activists spamming Occidental College's anonymous rape reporting form with false reports and plastering Edmonton with posters explaining, \"Just because you regret a one-night stand doesn't mean it wasn't consensual.\" Men, in fact, do face a particular gendered set of challenges that are too often ignored in feminist conversations including unequal paternity leave, unfair custody arrangements, the lack of discussions around the rape of men, the disproportionate prevalence of suicide among men, and the repressive nature of masculinity as a cultural force. But Men's Rights Activists, who could have rallied around these important issues for progressive purposes, have instead decided that their goal should be to violate women. MRAs often target rape victims, justifying their abuse by saying that fallacious accounts of rape of women are as much of a problem as rape itself. Rejecting the claim that women are oppressed by society, MRAs have taken to abusive tactics likeOccidental College's anonymous rape reporting form with false reports and plastering Edmonton with posters explaining, \"Just because you regret a one-night stand doesn't mean it wasn't consensual.\" 5.

Convinced that a series of cultural niceties catered to women (having doors help open for them, men paying for dinner, etc...) amounts to the institutional subjugation of men, Red Pillers certainly have had trouble reconciling the fact that the movie from which they take their name was, in fact, created byto make an 6.

            "Paragraph: More like Grandpa-lpatine. The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey’s parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine’s granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it’s pretty compelling. There’s the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey’s first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine’s fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey’s parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now. That’s because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark. In the film’s script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\". During Rey’s vision, Palpatine can be heard several times. Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine’s scream, and further along, there’s audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine’s inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke’s lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol’ Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey? The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens. In the portrait form, Rey’s strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they’re one. Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey’s British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine. There’s even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film’s script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film.\n",

            "Paragraph: Australian dragons cycle through more than 350 episodes of rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep each night, spending about half their sleeping hours in each phase. Do dragons dream? Maybe, according to new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon, for the first time. The discovery suggests that these phases of sleep may be more than 100 million years older than previously realized. REM sleep is characterized by brain waves that look similar to waking brain activity. In mammals, the large muscles of the body are immobile, but the eyes twitch randomly during REM sleep. People do most of their dreaming in this phase of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM sleep phase that is marked by slow brain waves called delta waves. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders] Quiet, sleep-like periods are known in many animals, even invertebrates like fruit flies. However, researchers had only found REM and slow-wave sleep brain activity in mammals and birds. Both of those kinds of animals diverged from a common group, the amniotes — mammals, reptiles and birds that lay eggs on land or hold them in their bodies — more than 300 million years ago. The amniotes gave rise to the synapsids and the sauropsids. Mammals are the only group of synapsids left (the earliest arose about 195 million years ago). The sauropsids encompassed the dinosaurs as well as modern birds and reptiles. The fact that sleep appeared only in these two disparate branches of the evolutionary tree was puzzling, said lead study researcher Gilles Laurent, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Germany. It seemed that mammals and birds had independently evolved the brain patterns for REM and slow-wave sleep — a case of convergent evolution — or, more confusingly, that these sleep patterns were an ancestral trait that was lost multiple times among reptile lineages but somehow not in birds. The new research, which will be published Friday (April 29) in the journal Science, suggests a much simpler explanation: REM and slow-wave sleep were present in a common amniote ancestor, and the fingerprints of these brain patterns had been missed until now. \"It poses many questions: How did sleep start? What did it start for? Is sleep the way that we understand it today in mammals, including humans, the same thing as what it started as?\" Laurent told Live Science. \"These questions are ones we'd like to find answers to.\" Laurent and his colleagues didn't intend to study sleep, at first. His lab is interested in how the cortex works, and he uses lizards as model organisms to study this brain region. The researchers were using electrodes implanted in the brains of Australian dragons (Pogona vitticeps) to record brain activity. An Australian dragon (Pogona vitticeps), the first lizard ever discovered to have mammalian-like brain patterns during sleep. The discovery, reported April 29 in the journal Science, suggests that the evolution of this brain activity may date back at least 320 million years. Credit: Dr. Stephan Junek, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research \"In the middle of some experiments we were doing, we decided to let the recordings go overnight after a day's work, just to see what would happen during the night,\" Laurent said. \"And upon analyzing the results, there were interesting oscillations of activity that were very regular, that suggested the potential existence of sleep-related patterns of activity in the brain.\" Further recordings of the brains of five different lizards of the same species revealed two distinct sleep patterns. One showed high-frequency wave forms of about 20 cycles per second. The other showed low-frequency wave forms of less than 4 cycles per second. Video recordings of the sleeping lizards showed that during the high-frequency brain activity, the dragons' eyes twitched periodically. \"We had a characterization that was starting to become more and more like what we observe in mammalian sleep,\" Laurent said. \"A REM phase with broadband activity and high-frequency activity, and slow-wave sleep where there is no eye movement.\" [What Do Dogs Dream About?] The slow waves also showed negative spikes of electrical potential 200 to 400 milliseconds long, interrupted with an oscillation of the brain's electrical activity, Laurent said. These \"sharp waves\" and \"ripples\" are seen in the slow brain waves of mammalian sleep, he said. Modern equipment and analysis techniques likely allowed Laurent and his team to find these brain patterns where others had failed, Laurent said. There are differences between the sleep of lizards and mammals, however. In humans, for example, the REM phase of the sleep cycle is relatively short. A person might experience just 5 minutes per hour of slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night, and then, as this phase gradually lengthens, 15 or 20 minutes per 90 minutes of slow-wave sleep later on. In the Australian dragon, the ratio of REM to slow-wave sleep is about 50-50. And the dragon cycles between the two every minute or minute and a half. They experience up to 350 sleep cycles per night, compared to four or five in humans. These patterns arose in a brain region called the dorsal ventricular ridge, which doesn't exist in mammals, Laurent said. The sleep patterns seen in the study were similar to the ones seen in the mouse hippocampus during sleep, but strangely, the dorsal ventricular ridge is not analogous in its connections or neural cell makeup to the mammal hippocampus at all, Laurent said. The research suggests that REM and slow-wave sleep may have evolved in the amniotes, but the patterns found in the lizards studied may be even older, Laurent said. Amphibian sleep has been studied and sleep patterns have not been found, he said, but perhaps scientists need to check again. In humans, REM sleep is closely associated with dreaming. So do Australian dragons dream? There's no way to be sure right now, Laurent said. The answer may also depend on how you define dreaming. Under a strict definition in which dreaming requires higher cognition, the answer might be no. But if dreaming were defined as a replay of brain activity during sleep that resembles brain activity during wakefulness, lizards might well dream, Laurent said. \"Maybe in a few years, we'll be able to tell you,\" he said.\n",

Either way, there's some good news for blotters: blotting the oil off the top of pizza does make it measurably healthier.

The closest approximation comes from the Food Network’s series Food Detectives. Host Ted Allen and a team of researchers from Popular Science came up with the figure of \"35 calories per slice on average (3.5 grams of oil).\" CNN’s Dr. Roshini Raj gives a similar appraisal: \"You are probably cutting 20 to 50 calories a piece – not a whole lot, but [...] if you have a couple of slices, it adds up.\" With an average slice of cheese pizza weighing in at 272 calories, blotting off 35 calories per piece equals a 13% reduction. Nutrition-savvy readers might recognize that 35 calories also equates to 1/100th of 3,500 calories: the number doctors generally agree equals one pound of human fat. An infographic by Labdoor Magazine gets a little bit more realistic with its calculations, using a slice of Domino’s pepperoni pizza as its standard and calculating total calorie reduction over a year based on the national average for pizza consumption: 23 pounds of pizza for every American. According to those calculations, blotting off the pizza grease can soak up 6611.2 calories in a year, or nearly two pounds’ worth of fat. Of course, there are caveats to the pizza blotting strategy. Along with fatty orange oil slicks, an injudiciously applied napkin might remove a pizza’s seasonings or take a bit of cheese and sauce with it, so it’s a choice that shouldn’t be made lightly. Blot if you will, but maybe just once in a while, leave the napkin on the side and live a little. [h/t Mic]\n",

            "Paragraph: CEO pay has gotten so out of whack in recent years that regulators are taking notice. The Securities and Exchange Commission released a proposed rule Wednesday that would require companies to reveal the ratio between CEO and worker pay. Supporters of the proposal, which is part of the Dodd-Frank reform law, say it would help give shareholders a better sense of which companies are paying their CEOs too much. But business groups say the rule would be too much of a burden on companies, requiring them to collect expensive data that doesn't really matter much to investors anyway. Regardless, the pay gap between CEOs and rank and file workers is stark. The CEO-to-average worker pay gap soared from 195:1 in 1993 to 354:1 in 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies. These companies have the largest gaps between CEO pay and median worker pay, according to PayScale.\n",

            "Topic: How Masturbation Can Help You Orgasm with a Partner\n",
            "Paragraph: Masturbation isn’t only enjoyable by yourself (although let’s be honest, it’s fun alone, too.) You can also utilize what you learn in your alone time to help you have more fun (and more orgasms) with a partner. Let’s talk about how! Train Your Clitoris to be more Responsive The clitoris is supremely sensitive, and can essentially be \"trained\" to orgasm from different types of stimulation. If you want your partner to be able to make you orgasm when you’re together, you can try exposing your clitoris to a wider range of sensation when you masturbate. The more ways you can teach yourself to reach orgasm, the easier it will be to get there with a partner. Just like with male masturbation, there are an endless number of ways to masturbate. A trip down the internet rabbit hole turns up suggestions that require everything from molding clay to turkey basters to Mardi Gras beads, but this Reddit thread has more approachable tips. Here are some of easy things to try: Try new strokes. Change the speed or pressure that you usually use. Use a different number of fingers. Get into new body positions. On your stomach or on your hands and knees are popular with a lot of women. Grind up against soft objects like pillows or blankets, or hard ones like your heel or the edge of a desk. Use a handheld showerhead or the bathtub faucet. Having a tried-and-true method is great, but it can be a ton of fun to learn new ways of pleasuring yourself. If you have a hard time making the switch to a new technique, there are a few things to try. First, try alternating between your old stand-by and a new technique of your choosing in one or two minute cycles. Try getting yourself right to the edge of orgasm with your usual method, then changing to the new one at the last possible second. Each time you give this a shot, try to lengthen the time you spend with the new technique. Another way to do it is to go cold-turkey on your typical routine. Knowing that you can’t rely on Old Faithful on can give you more motivation to make it work with the new technique. Show Your Partner how to do It There’s no need to be shy about your masturbation habits! If you want your partner to make you orgasm, one of the best things you can do is show your partner how you masturbate. Women who masturbate on their stomachs or by grinding against objects tend to be a little more embarrassed about masturbating in front of their partners than women who masturbate on their backs, with their hands, but there’s no reason it should be this way. Truly, there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way of masturbating, and there’s no reason to be ashamed of what you need to give yourself pleasure. Your partner would be crazy not to enjoy the show! Start off by masturbating on your own for a few minutes while your partner watches. Then have your partner put their hand over yours so they can get a feel for what you’re doing. You can do this whether you’re using your hands or a vibrator. Give them verbal feedback, like \"go in a circle\" or \"just a bit more pressure\". Once they’ve got a sense of what you’re doing, you can try tag-teaming your clitoris. Touch yourself for a few minutes, then let your partner take over for a few minutes, then repeat. Switching off like this will help your body get used to being stimulated by another person. Give Yourself a Hand There’s also no shame in masturbating to completion when you’re with a partner. This is a great strategy for women who can’t orgasm from penetration (i.e. 70% of us), or who experience a significant mismatch of orgasmic timing with their partners. Positions like doggystyle or woman on top make it incredibly easy to slip your hand or a vibrator down to your clitoris. You can also get yourself off first before moving on to intercourse (this is a good tip for women who experience sexual pain, since having an orgasm beforehand can help your muscles relax). Another fun thing to do is use your own hand on your clitoris while your partner uses their hand inside of you (more tag-teaming!). Or you can mix it up by having a session where you both masturbate in front of each other, that way everyone gets in on the masturbation fun! Making it easier to orgasm with a partner is yet another reason why masturbation can be so amazing. Put those fingers to work!

            "Paragraph: Shopping for a smartphone can be an intimidating process. After all, you’ll likely spend the next two years with whichever digital companion you buy, so you’d better choose wisely. If you’re an Apple fan, you’re getting an iPhone. You know it, I know it, your goldfish Steve knows it. But if you’re looking for an Android phone, then oh boy do you have choices. The newest big-name Android handsets are Samsung’s Galaxy S7, HTC’s 10, and LG’s G5. Each one has impressive features, but only one is the best. Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung’s Galaxy S7 looks a lot like its predecessor, the Galaxy S6. It features a metal frame ensconced by front and back glass panels. Everything about the phone’s design is nearly perfect. Adding to that is the fact that the S7 is waterproof. You can drop the handset in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes and it will keep working, no problem. Unfortunately, thanks to its smooth glass body, the S7 is also a fingerprint magnet, which takes away from its luster. HTC 10: The HTC 10 comes completely wrapped in a metal body with exaggerated chamfered edges that cause light to delicately reflect off of the handset. Up front, an edge-to-edge glass panel makes the 10 feel as luxurious as any phone on the market. It is, however, a bit on the bulky side. LG G5: Like the S7 and 10, the LG G5 sports a metal body. But the G5 is unique in that the handset has no physical home button on its front panel. Instead, LG has placed the home button on the back of the phone within easy reach of your pointer finger. The G5 has been designed as a modular handset, which means you can remove the bottom of the phone to do things like change its removable battery or add a camera or speaker extensions. The takeaway: Each of these phones is well-designed and attractive, but the fact that the S7 is waterproof is incredibly appealing. Sure the LG G5 allows you to swap out your battery, but I’d rather have to recharge my phone than worry about it being ruined after falling in a puddle. Display Samsung Galaxy S7: Packing a 5.1-inch display, the Galaxy S7’s Super AMOLED (active matrix of organic light-emitting diodes) display is among the brightest and most vibrant you’ll find on a smartphone. Colors explode off the screen, and blacks are incredibly deep. The only downside: Colors can look exaggerated at times, causing things like blue skies to look a bit unnatural. HTC 10: HTC equipped the 10 with a 5.2-inch Super LCD 5 display that when viewed head-on looks clear and crisp. The problem is that the 10’s screen is incredibly dim. By itself its screen seems plenty bright, but place it next to the S7, and it’s a completely different story. LG G5: HTC’s 10 isn’t the only phone with a dim display. In fact, the LG G5’s 5.3-inch panel is even dimmer than the 10’s. Like the 10, text and images viewed on the G5 look clean and sharp, but the screen just isn’t bright enough even when viewed inside under normal lights. Trying to view the screen in bright sunlight is almost uncomfortable. The takeaway: There’s no contest here, the Galaxy S7 has the brightest, most colorful display of the group. Camera Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung made a big deal about the S7’s new 12-megapixel camera — and for good reason. It takes some of the best shots you’ll get with a smartphone. Colors look fantastic, and details are razor sharp. What’s more, the S7 is an absolute beast when it comes to taking pictures in low-light situations. That said, Samsung’s cameras tend to exaggerate certain colors. HTC 10: The HTC 10’s 12-megapixel rear camera is one of the most capable shooters HTC has produced. Images come out clear, and low-light photos are reasonably clean. If this was your everyday shooter, you’d have little to complain about. That said, the 10’s camera doesn’t offer as much color as the S7’s. Instead, some scenes can look a bit washed out. You’ll also see some pixelation in your low-light shots. And taking pictures with too much movement while in low-light situations causes a good deal of blurring. LG G5: The G5 is unique in that it has two separate lenses for different shooting situations. One lens is used for your standard close-up shots and captures 16-megapixel images, while the other is designed for large panoramic pictures and captures 8-megapixel images. In reality, though, you’ll more than likely end up using the phone’s standard 16-megapixel camera. Photos taken with the G5’s 16-megapixel shooter were clear and artifact-free. In terms of color, the G5’s shots fell between the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7. They weren’t washed out or were they overly saturated. Low-light shots were clear, though not as bright as the Galaxy S7’s pictures. The takeaway: None of these three phones takes bad photos, but between the three, I lean toward the Galaxy S7’s camera, as I’m a fan of its exaggerated colors and its low-light photo capabilities. Performance Samsung Galaxy S7: Powered by a quad-core processor and 4GB of RAM, the S7 is an incredibly powerful handset. I’ve been using the phone since it came out and haven’t seen any signs of slowdown or lag. I’m also continually impressed by how fast the S7’s fingerprint reader unlocks the handset. The S7 comes with 32GB of onboard storage. And if you run through all of that, you can always throw in your own microSD card to increase the S7’s storage capacity. The S7’s battery will last all day on a single charge, and thanks to its fast-charging capabilities, you can get a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. HTC 10: The HTC 10 comes with the same quad-core processor and 4GB of RAM as the S7, so you’re not going to see a huge difference between the two handsets in terms of performance. Also like the S7, the 10 comes with 32GB of storage that can be expanded using the phone’s microSD card slot. Like the Galaxy S7, the 10 will also charge to 50 percent in 30 minutes. LG G5: It’s déjà vu all over again, folks. The LG G5, like the HTC 10 and S7, has the same processor and 4GB of RAM. In other words, these phones are all fast. You’ll also get 32GB of onboard storage that can be expanded with a microSD card. The LG G5 does, however, have a slightly smaller battery than the S7 and HTC 10. Still, you can remove and replace the G5’s power plant when it’s running low on juice, something you can’t do with the S7 or HTC 10. The takeaway: You’re not going to see any major differences in terms of performance between these three phones, but the LG G5’s removable battery sets it apart from the pack. Software Samsung Galaxy S7: Samsung’s Galaxy S7 runs on the Google’s Android 6.0 operating system, but augments the software with its own TouchWiz interface. TouchWiz basically changes Android’s home screen, icon designs, and notifications menu to give it a more Samsung-centric look. Normally I dislike it when smartphone makers mess with Google’s Android, and Samsung used to be the No. 1 offender when it came to screwing with the software. But in recent years, the company has eased up on its changes. Its new version of TouchWiz is less intrusive than previous iterations and easier to navigate. It’s still not pure Android, though. HTC 10: This is as close to running an untouched version of Google’s Android 6.0 software as you can get short of buying one of Google’s own Nexus phones. HTC has only made slight changes to Google’s Android interface, and the user experience is better for it. On top of that, HTC has done away with its own apps that essentially mirror existing Google apps, so you don’t have to deal with having two photo gallery apps or two Web browsers. LG G5: LG also runs Google’s Android 6.0 operating system, but unfortunately the OS is completely covered by LG’s confusing user interface. See, like Samsung, LG puts its own stamp on Android by changing the operating system’s icons and notification menu. But the notifications menu is such an odd bright green and white color scheme, that it’s almost hard to read. And LG’s decision to not give people a standard Android apps page and instead put every app on the phone’s various home screens like the iPhone is annoying. Suffice it to say, I’m not a fan. The takeaway: While Samsung has toned down its TouchWiz interface, I’ve got to give this round to HTC for going with what already works — straight-up Android. And the winner is ... After five rounds, the Samsung Galaxy S7 came out head and shoulders above its competitors. If you’re in the market for an Android phone, the S7 is easily the best option available. That said, if the ability to replace your phone’s battery is of the utmost importance, you should grab LG’s G5. Similarly, if you’re interested in an Android phone that doesn’t cover up the Android interface with a silly skin, the HTC 10 is worth checking out. But overall, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the best Android phone you can buy.\n",

            "Paragraph: Natalie Portman thinks feminism is about more than women being \"kick-ass.\" She wishes we would just let our on-screen -- and off-screen -- men and women simply be human. She spoke with actor Tom Hiddleston on the subject in an interview for Elle UK's November issue: I want every version of a woman and a man to be possible. I want women and men to be able to be full-time parents or full-time working people or any combination of the two. I want both to be able to do whatever they want sexually without being called names. I want them to be allowed to be weak and strong and happy and sad -- human, basically. The fallacy in Hollywood is that if you’re making a \"feminist\" story, the woman kicks ass and wins. That’s not feminist, that’s macho. A movie about a weak, vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with. We are 100 percent with Portman on this one. Of course there should be more nuanced and complex women being portrayed in film and on television. And Portman's thoughts seem to echo Sophia McDougall's argument against the label \"strong female character\" in the New Statesman. \"No one ever asks if a male character is 'strong.' Nor if he’s 'feisty,' or 'kick-ass' come to that,\" she writes. No one asks those questions of male characters because there are so many more interesting things to be. \"We need get away from the idea that sexism in fiction can be tackled by reliance on depiction of a single personality type, that you just need to write one female character per story right and you’ve done enough,\" McDougall argues. We're pretty sure that Natalie Portman would agree.\n",

            "Topic: Find The Right Credit Card The Right Way\n",
            "Paragraph: When choosing a credit card, many people work backward: They're lured by flashy bonuses or rewards before considering whether the rewards actually match up with their spending. That means a whole lot of people are walking around with the wrong credit cards in their wallets.  There is no single best credit card for everyone. The best card for a frequent traveler is not the same as the best card for a homebody, and the best airline card for someone living in San Francisco probably won't be the best card for someone in Dallas. Many credit cards beat the competition on one feature or perk, so it all depends on what you're looking for. The best credit card also depends on what you'll use it for. If you're working on paying down credit card debt, I don't recommend that you pursue credit card rewards. You'll be much better off with a card that helps you pay less interest. But if you pay off your cards in full every month, there's no reason not to choose a card based on rewards. Three steps to the best credit card Assuming you're looking to earn rewards from your credit card, how do you find the best one for you? Ask yourself three questions, in this order: Where do you spend your money?  What kind of rewards do you want?  What perks and bonuses are you looking for? Before you scoff at that list as painfully obvious, take a moment to think about how you chose your last card. I'd bet you took the inverse approach, starting with step 3, or maybe 2, and working back to 1. Almost everyone does, and it severely limits the amount of rewards you can expect. Why most people choose credit cards poorly Based on my experience, most people have three types of cards in their wallet: one from the same bank where they have a checking account, a card or two from stores that offered one-time discounts for signing up, and a branded airline card that offers miles.  Out of those, the airline card is probably the favorite for daily spending and was chosen with the goal of earning airline miles, because who doesn't want to earn free travel? But this approach fails to take into account how credit card rewards are earned. Most rewards cards tend to reward spending in specific categories. For example, airline cards tend to give 2 or 3 points or miles for every dollar spent with that airline and only 1 point per dollar everywhere else. So unless most of your spending is on travel, you could miss out on hundreds of dollars' worth of rewards per year. The best credit card depends on your spending To get the most value from credit card rewards, you need to find the right match between your spending and the available cards in your credit range. Otherwise, you're just leaving money on the table. Let's go back to those three questions.  1. Where do you spend money? You want cards that give you the highest rewards where you shop the most. That means you need to make an honest assessment of where you spend. Do you spend more on groceries or restaurants? Gas or airplane tickets? Chances are that there are a few categories in which you spend more than others and that there are cards that will give rich rewards in those same categories. To bring that advice to reality, NerdWallet's credit card tool can help filter cards based on their rewards categories. 2. What kind of rewards do you want? Think about what kind of rewards will give you the best value and the most enjoyment. Would you prefer flexible travel points or airline-specific miles? Or perhaps you'd be happier with the simplest reward of all: cash back. 3. What perks and bonuses are you looking for? Now you can look at the flashy stuff: the perks and bonuses. Do you want airport lounge access, free checked bags or travel credits? Or would you prefer cash back that you could deposit into your checking account or use when checking out at Amazon?  Finding the best credit card isn't hard  it just takes some self-reflection. By following this approach, you can greatly increase your rewards earnings with practically no effort. Plus, you can earn even more if you're willing to carry a few cards, with each optimized for your major spending categories or favorite stores. Take a few minutes to consider the cards in your wallet. If you're like most Americans who chose their primary credit card only for the type of rewards it promised, instead of the way they spend money, it's probably time to find the best credit card for you.\n",

            "Topic: I have found a new way to watch TV, and it changes everything\n",
            "Paragraph: Jeff Guo's digital avatar watches TV on fast-forward. (Dani Johnson, Amy King / The Washington Post) I HAVE a habit that horrifies most people. I watch television and films in fast forward. This has become increasingly easy to do with computers (I’ll show you how) and the time savings are enormous. Four episodes of \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" fit into an hour. An entire season of \"Game of Thrones\" goes down on the bus ride from D.C. to New York. I started doing this years ago to make my life more efficient. Between trendy Web shows, auteur cable series, and BBC imports, there’s more to watch than ever before. Some TV execs worry that the industry is outpacing its audience. A record-setting 412 scripted series ran in 2015, nearly double the number in 2009. \"There is simply too much television,\" FX Networks CEO John Landgraf said last year. Nonsense, responded Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos, who has been commissioning shows at a startling rate. \"There’s no such thing as too much TV,\" he said. So here we are, spending three hours a day on average, scrambling to keep up with the Kardashians, the Starks, the Underwoods, and the dozens of others on the roster of must-watch TV, which has exploded in the age of fragmented audiences. Nowadays, to stay on the same wavelength with your different groups of friends — the ones hating on \"Meat Chad\" and the ones cooing over Khaleesi — you have to watch in bulk. This is where the trick of playing videos at 1.5x to 2x comes in — the latest twist in the millennia-old tradition of technology changing storytelling. The concept should be familiar to many. For years, podcast and audiobook players have provided speedup options, and research shows that most people prefer listening to accelerated speech. In recent years, software has made it much easier to perform the same operation on videos. This was impossible for home viewers in the age of VHS. But computers can now easily speed up any video you throw at them. You can play DVDs and iTunes purchases at whatever tempo you like. YouTube allows you select a speedup factor on its player. And a Google engineer has written a popular Chrome extension that accelerates most other Web videos, including on Netflix, Vimeo and Amazon Prime. Over 100,000 people have downloaded that plug-in, and the reviews are ecstatic. \"Oh my God! I regret all the wasted time I've lived before finding this gem!!\" one user wrote. But speeding up video is more than an efficiency hack. I quickly discovered that acceleration makes viewing more pleasurable. \"Modern Family\" played at twice the speed is far funnier — the jokes come faster and they seem to hit harder. I get less frustrated at shows that want to waste my time with filler plots or gratuitous violence. The faster pace makes it easier to appreciate the flow of the plot and the structure of the scenes. Wonkblog writer Jeff Guo watches all his television shows at 160% speed. This clip from ABC's Modern Family will give you an idea of what that looks like. (ABC) As I’ve come to consume all my television on my computer, I’ve developed other habits, too. I don't watch linearly anymore; I often scrub back and forth to savor complex scenes or to skim over slow ones. In other words, I watch television like I read a book. I jump around. I re-read. Sometimes I speed up. Sometimes I slow down. I confess these new viewing techniques have done something strange to my sense of reality. I can’t watch television in real-time anymore. Movie theaters feel suffocating. I need to be able to fast-forward and rewind and accelerate and slow down, to be able to parcel my attention where it's needed. The most common objection I hear is that this ruins the cinematic experience. Annette Insdorf, a film professor at Columbia, told me: \"Sometimes watching a movie is like lovemaking: Isn't a sustained seduction more gratifying than momentary thrills?\" But the more I've learned about the history and the science of media consumption, the more I've come to believe this is the future of how we will appreciate television and movies. We will interrogate videos in new ways using our powers of time manipulation. Maybe not everyone will watch on fast-forward like I do, but we will all be watching on our own terms. In a way, what's happening to video recalls what happened to literature when we stopped reading aloud, together, and started reading silently, alone. Beginning in the Middle Ages, people no longer had to gather in groups to hear tales or learn the news or study religion. They could be alone with a text and their own thoughts, an unprecedented freedom that led to political and religious turmoil and forever changed intellectual life. With computers, video consumption is also becoming a solitary, self-paced act — and maybe a more analytical act, as well. If you believe, as I do, in the artistic potential of television and film, then perhaps we are on the brink of another cultural transformation — viewers finally seizing control of this medium. And the medium will be better for it. FOR a very long time, life was limited by the rate at which we spoke. Although we have had writing systems for millennia, early texts were designed to be read aloud, meaning that literature unfolded at the pace of human speech. Many ancient Greek and Roman documents, for instance, lacked punctuation, spaces or lowercase letters, making it challenging for people to understand them without sounding out the words syllable by syllable. \"A written text was essentially a transcription which, like modern musical notation, became an intelligible message only when it was performed orally to others or to oneself,\" historian Paul Saenger writes. There are physical limits to how quickly we can form sounds, as anyone who has attempted a tongue-twister can attest. Mouths need time to move into position for the next vowel or consonant. A good estimate for the natural rate of speech in English is 200 to 300 syllables per minute, which translates into 150 to 200 words per minute. According to Audible, the audiobook company, the typical book recording is performed at 155 wpm. A 1990 study found that radio broadcasts run at 160 wpm on average, while everyday conversations, which use shorter words, occur at about 210 wpm. For much of human history, this was the sound barrier for communicating ideas. It’s not that silent reading was impossible in antiquity. It was just very difficult. There exist tales of scholars who seemed to absorb books silently; in the fourth century, Saint Augustine told of an odd monk who read without forming the words with his mouth. \"When he read,\" Augustine wrote, \"his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still.\" Historians debate whether these silent readers were regarded as freaks or the practice was merely unusual. Reading was still a group activity in the fifth and sixth centuries. One person read aloud while others listened. Even for scribes who copied manuscripts in solitude, the act of reading was intertwined with the act of speaking. Many early medieval monks who had taken vows of silence were still allowed to mumble as they read, Saenger writes, because mumbling was considered part of the reading process. During the Middle Ages, scribes began introducing spacing and punctuation into texts, which made silent reading much easier for everyone. The practice began in monasteries around the 10th century and slowly spread to university libraries a few hundred years later, and finally to the European aristocracy by the 14th and 15th centuries, according to historian Roger Chartier. The technique of silent, solitary reading released people from the sluggishness of the spoken word — as well as from the judgment of their peers. Reading in private gave people room to engage with a text, the freedom to think critically and sometimes heretically. Opinions too controversial for group reading could be disseminated and consumed in private. The result, historians say, was an intellectual, scientific — and spiritual — blossoming in Europe. \"Silent, secret, private reading paved the way for previously unthinkable audacities,\" Chartier writes. \"In the late Middle Ages, even before the invention of the printing press, heretical texts circulated in manuscript form, critical ideas were expressed, and erotic books, suitably illuminated, enjoyed considerable success.\" Chartier called silent reading the \"other revolution\" — together with the printing press and mass literacy, these developments created both the demand and the supply for a vast quantity of writing. The faster pace of silent reading accelerated the spread of new ideas and vaulted Western society toward religious and political schism. \"This ‘privatization’ of reading is undeniably one of the major cultural developments of the early modern era,\" Chartier argued. WHAT silent reading also revealed was that the rate of human thought far outstrips the rate of human speech. Broadcasters speak at about 160 wpm, but college students can comfortably devour a text at 300 wpm, which also seems to be the most efficient speed for reading comprehension, on average. Some people, of course, read slower, and others read much, much faster. The beauty of text is that we absorb it at our own pace. Not so for audiovisual recordings, at least not for much of the 20th century. If you play back a tape or a phonograph record too quickly, the voices turn squeaky and unintelligible. Recordings remained difficult to skim until the 1950s, when researchers made a set of discoveries about human speech. It turns out that sounds of the spoken word are vastly redundant. Vowels and consonants drag on longer than necessary for us to understand them. In the late 1940s, Harvard researchers discovered they could cover up more than half of a speech recording without damaging a listener’s comprehension. The trick was to rapidly mute and unmute the audio. These silent gaps were brief enough that people’s minds could fill them in easily. Words sounded choppy, but they remained perfectly intelligible. \"It is much like seeing a landscape through a picket fence,\" the researchers wrote. \"The pickets interrupt the view at regular intervals, but the landscape is perceived as continuing behind the pickets.\" The Harvard researchers rapidly muted and unmuted audio recordings. The top picture shows the original sound wave. The bottom picture shows the resulting sound wave, which has silent bits. Even though half of the sound wave has been destroyed, the researchers found that people could still understand it. (Miller and Licklider, 1950.) A team of engineers at the University of Illinois soon had another idea: Instead of leaving the gaps in, why not cut them out and stitch the remaining slivers of audio together? For instance, deleting every other millisecond of audio would cause the recording to play in half the time. This new way of speeding up sound, which became known as the sampling method, had the benefit of not making people sound like chipmunks. In the 1960s, a blind psychologist named Emerson Foulke began experimenting with this technique to accelerate speech. A professor at the University of Louisville, Foulke was frustrated with the slowness of recorded books for the blind, so he tried speeding them up. The sampling method proved surprisingly effective. In Foulke’s experiments, speech could be accelerated to 250-275 wpm without affecting people’s scores on a listening comprehension test. These limits were suspiciously close to the average college reading rate. Foulke suspected that beyond 300 wpm, deeper processes in the brain were getting overloaded. Experiments showed that at 300-400 wpm, individual words were still clear enough to understand; except at that rate, many listeners couldn’t keep up with rapid stream of words, likely because their short-term memories were overtaxed. Some, of course, fared better than others. Just as people naturally read at different rates, subjects varied in how well they could understand accelerated speech. Further studies found a connection to cognitive ability. Those with higher intelligence, as well as faster readers, were more adept at understanding sped-up recordings. (The NSA once considered using tests involving accelerated speech to screen for people who could become morse code operators.) The most startling discovery, though, was that people actually enjoy listening to accelerated audio. Foulke and his colleagues noticed that college students preferred recordings that had been sped up by 30 percent, from 175 wpm to 222 wpm. More recent studies find that, given the choice, people will increase playback rate by about 40 to 50 percent on average — a 1.4 to 1.5x speedup. This tendency extends to video as well, as experiments with video lectures and even Discovery Channel shows have shown. Increasing the tempo of a recording seems to stave off boredom and help people stay engaged. \"With the slower pace, my attention span actually wavered, and I focused on too much detail,\" one subject told researchers at Microsoft. Sometimes, people don't even notice that they are watching on fast-forward. Cable companies will slightly speed up shows to make room for more ads, but the difference can be hard to detect — in part because the brain adapts to the higher speeds. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Defense Department began investigating compressed speech as a way to boost learning. Military-funded experiments showed that people can be trained to better understand accelerated recordings. Just a few weeks of regular exposure seemed to alter how people perceived and processed language, causing them to prefer faster and faster listening rates. Some of those changes happen within minutes. An experiment in 1997 found that listening to just five sentences of accelerated speech boosted subsequent comprehension rates by 15 percent. This process may be related to how our brains adjust to unfamiliar accents. Have you ever noticed that it becomes easier and easier to talk to someone with a foreign accent? It’s not them. It’s your brain making short-term adaptations. Our brains also make long-term adaptations to accelerated speech. Continued training increases people’s accuracy rates and their comfort with sped-up recordings. Functional MRI scans show changes in how their brains respond to speech. Anecdotally, many subjects found that repeated exposure to accelerated speech caused speech at regular speeds to sound strange. This seems to have happened to me as well. After watching accelerated video on my computer for a few months, live television began to seem excruciatingly slow. Ilya Grigorik, the Google engineer who invented the Chrome extension, had a similar experience. He regularly watches videos at double speed, adjusting the pace up or down depending on how complex the ideas are. \"Whenever I describe it to people, I get a very weird look,\" he said. \"Then I actually convince them to try it. It’s uncomfortable for them at first, but once they get into it, they really get into it.\" WE all chart our own paths through a text. I rarely read a book straight through from start to finish. I take detours, I backtrack, and I always scan the plot summary on Wikipedia to learn what's coming next. Psychologists at the University of California, San Diego have found that people enjoy a story more if the ending has already been spoiled. Suspense, it seems, is overrated. The Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov believed that re-reading was the only way to truly enjoy a novel. Not until the second or third go-around can we perceive a novel’s grand schemes and secrets. Of the initial encounter, he once said: \"When we read a book for the first time, the very process of laboriously moving our eyes from left to right, line after line, page after page, this complicated physical work upon the book, the very process of learning in terms of space and time what the book is about, this stands between us and artistic appreciation.\" There's no one right way to enjoy a book. Literary theorist Roland Barthes encouraged us not to treat novels so literally or linearly, but to traipse around in search of our own meanings. Why, then, do we still watch television straightforwardly? Why do we relinquish ourselves to the pace set by a film’s director? Can't we find more interesting ways to be a couch potato? For a long time, the answer was that the technology did not allow it. But with the rise of computer viewing, everyone can take charge of how they travel through a video. I often consume reality programs at double speed or faster because the idioms of these shows are so familiar. For me, watching \"The Bachelorette\" is like shucking a crab. I know where the juicy bits are, and I know which parts are inedible. Accelerated speeds make it easier to perceive the structure of a story; slower speeds allow me to savor the details of the filmmaking. These alternative styles of viewing are no less illuminating. At double speed, the Red Wedding scene from \"Game of Thrones\" crosses the threshold from high drama to high farce. You start to see how the directors strained to create a moment of maximum trauma, how the death scenes are overacted, how the massacre operates like the mechanical gnashings of a meat-processing plant. Wonkblog writer Jeff Guo watches all his television shows at 160% speed. This clip from HBO's Game of Thrones will give you an idea of what that looks like. (HBO) I recently described my viewing habits to Mary Sweeney, the editor on the cerebral cult classic \"Mulholland Drive.\" She laughed in horror. \"Everything you just said is just anathema to a film editor,\" she said. \"If you don't have respect for how something was edited, then try editing some time! It's very hard.\" Sweeney, who is also a professor at the University of Southern California, believes in the privilege of the auteur. She told me a story about how they removed all the chapter breaks from the DVD version of Mulholland Drive to preserve the director’s vision. \"The film, which took two years to make, was meant to be experienced from beginning to end as one piece,\" she said. I disagree. Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite films, but it's intentionally dreamlike and incomprehensible at times. The DVD version even included clues from director David Lynch to help people baffled by the plot. I advise first-time viewers to watch with a remote in hand to ward off disorientation. Liberal use of the fast-forward and rewind buttons allows people to draw connections between different sections of the film. I found something of a sympathetic ear in Peter Markham, who teaches directing at the American Film Institute Conservatory. \"This notion of privacy, of watching privately and forming your own cathedral of narrative — that’s interesting,\" he said. \"But that, I think, is mostly an intellectual or cerebral experience. The thing about dramatic narrative is that it creates an emotional, visceral, subconscious experience. That stuff has its own rhythm, its own insistence.\" Markham argued that film is more than a stream of dialogue or a sequence of events. The timing of the images imprints on our brains in a special way. \"If you speed up Hitchcock, if you speed up \"Rear Window,\" you won’t get the same experience,\" he said. \"It’s like trying to speed up a Beyoncé track. It’s already at the perfect speed.\" IT didn’t occur to me until later, of course, that people do mess with Beyoncé all the time. DJs chop her up, stretch her over new beats, snatch bits of her vocals to craft new songs. Today’s cinema fans also engage in forms of creative remixing. They assemble montages of their favorite characters. They create entirely original shows by re-editing scenes from ones. The actor Topher Grace, for instance, famously made his own unauthorized version of the \"Star Wars\" prequel movies called \"Episode III.5: The Editor Strikes Back.\" Those who have seen it say it's a masterful recombobulation of those three flawed films. Henry Jenkins, a media theorist at the University of Southern California, reminded me that creative repurposing has been happening in fan communities for decades. Throughout his career, Jenkins has studied the rise of \"participatory culture\" — ways in which fans take control of favorite stories through fanzines, fan art, fan fiction, and more recently, fan videos. \"Fans reject the idea of a definitive version produced, authorized, and regulated by some media conglomerate,\" Jenkins wrote over a decade ago. \"Instead, fans envision a world where all of us can participate in the creation and circulation of central cultural myths.\" Perhaps fan culture offers the most optimistic vision for the future of media consumption. The power of the auteur is diminishing, but our appreciation for the art form is increasing. More and more, we will watch TV on our computers, on own terms, creating our own meanings and deriving our own, private pleasures. \"I think your experience is very similar to my own,\" Jenkins said. \"I do treat television more and more like a book. I totally get that analogy, and it's a good way to think about the degree of control we now have over what we watch — which has been building up over time, with VCRs, then DVRs, and now streaming and digital distribution. We're learning to think about television in a different way.\" \"I'm fully convinced that everything is better in a box set,\" he added. Netflix, which is essentially the motherlode of box sets, has made this kind of careful viewing much easier. That's one reason that serialized shows have become so popular in recent years. Since audiences can easily catch up on missed episodes — many of them are bingewatching anyway — show-runners can tell longer, more complicated stories with less repetition. The rewind button allows television to be a little more sophisticated. If you didn't understand the first time, just watch again. But the spread of solitary, customized viewing will not mean the demise of television culture — quite the opposite. People will watch an episode and dissect it on Twitter; they will share their favorite scenes and watch them on repeat. \"While viewing is becoming a more solitary, personal activity, the flip side is that fan communities have grown stronger,\" Jennifer Holt, a media scholar at the University of California at Santa Barbara, told me. \"People still want to connect. They still want that social experience, only now it's all happening online.\" This practice has expanded the dialogue between the makers and the consumers of television. \"Show creators, writers and directors are now extremely sensitive to what the blogosphere is saying about their shows,\" Paris Barclay, the president of the Directors Guild of America, said a few years ago. Barclay, who has worked on shows such as \"Glee,\" \"Empire\" and \"Scandal,\" was wary of this development. \"Some shows have become increasingly dull because taking risks with the show is discouraged,\" he said. \"Audiences generally want to see a different version of the show that they love. They don’t really want to see it become something else.\" But as Jenkins, the media theorist, points out, creators have always adapted their work to suit who was listening. \"Storytelling is a bardic medium,\" he said. \"Bards like Homer would tell a story to a roomful of people and he would be attentive to what they liked and what they didn't like. The same was true of Dickens, whose novels were published serially. He changed plot points and characters on the fly.\" Now that tools are making it increasingly easy to alter the flow of how we watch films and television, viewers will also have power to change the plot and the characters of a show to suit their own tastes. We should look forward to a future that involves more cross-pollination, more crazy fan-theories, more creative misunderstandings, all of it enabled by new ways of consuming television, whether that means binge-watching, surfing clips on social media or even watching on fast-forward. We risk transforming, perhaps permanently, the ways in which our brains perceive people, time, space, emotion. And isn’t that marvelous?\n",

            "Paragraph: \"I am here today to talk about a lie.\" That's how politics professor Caroline Heldman opened her Jan. 2013 TEDxYouth San Diego talk on the topic of sexual objectification. \"I'd like to talk specifically about the lie, or the idea, that being a sex object is empowering.\" Heldman explained that sexual objectification is so common that many young people struggle to even recognize it as such: \"It's like being raised in a red room, being pulled out of that room, and asked to describe the color red.\" She added that girls may grow up believing that being objectified is actually empowering because American culture teaches that to be a sex object is to be valuable. However, the consequences of objectification to society are far from positive, and side effects among women include body shame, depression, eating disorders, low self-esteem and even decreased sexual pleasure, according to Heldman: Instead of being involved and engaged in what is happening, you tend to view yourself from a third-party perspective. A spectator's perspective, where you're worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure. So if there's anything I can pitch to you about why you don't want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure. Heldman drew on the work of others to create a 7-step test to determine if an image is sexually objectifying. An image is sexually objectifying if \"yes\" is the answer to any of the following questions: Does the image show only parts of a sexualized person's body? Does the image present a sexualized person as a stand-in for an object? Does the image show a sexualized person as interchangeable? Does the image affirm the idea of violating the bodily integrity of a sexualized person that can't consent? Does the image suggest that sexual availability is the defining characteristic of the person? Does the image show a sexualized person as a commodity? Does the image treat a sexualized person's body as a canvas? Perhaps the most powerful part of the video is the end, where Heldman invites us to \"imagine a different world,\" offering viewers tools to navigate, and eventually, change objectification culture. We highly recommend watching.\n",

            "Topic: This man could soon be handling America’s most politically charged investigation\n",
            "Paragraph: Rod J. Rosenstein is, by most accounts, about as good a nominee for deputy attorney general as Democrats could hope for. And if the Trump administration gets its way, he could soon be the man handling the most politically charged investigation in the nation. The U.S. attorney for Maryland has sterling bipartisan credentials stretching back to the Clinton administration. The longest-serving U.S. attorney, Rosenstein was unanimously confirmed to his post, based in Baltimore, in 2005 after being nominated by then-President George W. Bush and winning support from the state’s two Democratic senators. He kept the job in 2009 when the Obama administration arrived, and on Tuesday, after the new Republican administration nominated Rosenstein to the No. 2 post in the Justice Department, Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) happily introduced him to the Judiciary Committee. Yet Rosenstein might receive little Democratic support, and some have signaled that they intend to slow-walk his nomination and stretch out the confirmation process through the rest of the month because they want a special prosecutor to take charge of DOJ’s investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and Trump associates’ links to the Kremlin. That’s because, in recusing himself from any investigations of President Trump’s 2016 campaign, Attorney General Jeff Sessions handed the case to whoever will be his No. 2 — meaning Rosenstein, if he is confirmed. The situation has left Democrats wrapped inside their own paradoxical box: The price of their support for a speedy confirmation is Rosenstein promising to appoint a special prosecutor. \"If Mr. Rosenstein is unwilling to commit to naming a special prosecutor, or says that he needs to be confirmed and in his position before he can make an assessment — that is insufficient,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech Tuesday morning. \"The need for a special prosecutor is clear enough today to make that call.\" A little more than an hour after Sessions announced last week that he would recuse himself from any Trump-related cases, Sen. Richard J. Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he would use \"every possible tool to block\" Rosenstein’s confirmation until the nominee committed to naming a special prosecutor. But that is the sort of commitment that almost no nominee, to a Justice Department position or to be a federal judge, would ever make. That sort of answer would seem to prejudge a case before someone has reviewed the investigative material. It is typically considered a big no-no for judges and other executive branch nominees to key positions to tip their hands in confirmation hearings, leading to decades of answers by nominees with well-rehearsed lines about upholding the law without taking a formal stand. That’s exactly what Rosenstein did Tuesday, deflecting questions about his view of the case by promising to follow the advice of Justice Department experts. \"I would evaluate the facts and the law [and] consider the applicable law,\" he told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). He promised to use \"my best judgment\" in handling the Russia investigation and vowed to take the \"right course of action.\" He noted that he has not been allowed to review the case because he has not been confirmed. The standoff over Rosenstein sets up a scenario in which Democrats will continue to demand the appointment of a special prosecutor in a Trump-related Russia inquiry. Yet they will be holding up the confirmation of the one person who might actually make such an appointment. Republicans are in what may be an even stranger position. They have almost uniformly rejected calls for a special prosecutor, saying that an investigation can be dealt with in the normal ranks of the Justice Department and in the congressional intelligence committees. Grassley began the hearing by highlighting Rosenstein’s record handling sensitive cases, including a leak investigation in the Obama administration, and reminded Democrats of how a special prosecutor was not called to direct the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s treatment of classified information when she served as a secretary of state. Yet in calling for Rosenstein’s speedy confirmation, Grassley and Republicans may be demanding the appointment of an official who might disagree with them and decide to set up a more robust, independent investigation of alleged Russian ties to the Trump 2016 campaign. That’s the view of someone who has watched Rosenstein up close. Cardin, a former member of the Judiciary Committee, recommended in 2009 that then-President Obama retain Rosenstein as the state’s top federal prosecutor, telling the panel Tuesday that a broad cross-section of Maryland’s legal community supported him. \"This was a welcomed nomination by President Trump,\" Cardin told the panel, recounting the \"totally nonpartisan professional manner\" Rosenstein adopted in his investigations. Like his fellow Democrats, Cardin thinks a special prosecutor is needed in the Russia case. Unlike many Democrats, he is willing to support Rosenstein without a guarantee of such a move. \"I think Mr. Rosenstein is the right person at the right time,\" Cardin told his colleagues, predicting that the nominee’s record would lead him to make the decision that Democrats want. \"I am confident of his judgment on these issues.\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, agreed that Rosenstein is \"well-qualified\" but she highlighted the conflicts within the Justice Department in the early days of Trump’s presidency. After the first travel ban was issued preventing visits from seven Muslim-majority nations, the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, refused to defend the executive order and was fired by Trump. \"This is about the integrity of the process,\" Feinstein said, noting that she feared Trump’s West Wing would exert influence over the investigation. \"There is a real danger, I believe, that the Justice Department could become politicized.\" Blumenthal and other Democrats pointed to the 1973 confirmation of Elliot Richardson as attorney general, during which he vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the Watergate investigations. They want a similar pledge from Rosenstein — and are prepared to delay his confirmation as long as they can. \"This situation is extraordinary,\" Blumenthal said, \"and he is a professional career prosecutor who knows that there is a need — who should know, should know — there is a need for independence and protection from political influence here.\"\n",

Robots might rise up against us and destroy humanity forever, but the world will keep on spinning, and the Solar System will still have eight planets (sorry Pluto). But nothing is forever, no matter how many billions of years you've existed, and theoretical physicist Brian Greene just demonstrated to Colbert how a star like our Sun will end. Now, we don't want to alarm you or anything, but at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself, and everything we know and love will die. If you have kids, that's something you maybe want to give the delicate 'birds and the bees' treatment to when it comes time to explain that little nugget of truth to them, lest they end up like one of Louis CK's daughters, when he decided to marvel at the incredible, flaming violence of it all: \"She started crying immediately, crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity... and now she knows all of those things: she’s gonna die, everybody she knows is gonna die, they’re gonna be dead for a very long time, and then the Sun’s gonna explode.

            "Topic: Five myths about the cross\n",
            "Paragraph: Christians worldwide are commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus in Good Friday worship services, followed by celebration of his resurrection on Easter Sunday. But as often as the cross appears in Christian artwork and Western culture at large, misunderstandings and myths persist as to its history, origins and image. Here are five of the most stubborn misconceptions about Christianity’s most prominent symbol. The iconic image of the Christian cross tends to feature a central vertical beam transected by a perpendicular beam about a third of the way down. This version of the cross is visible everywhere from emoji (which include both the two-beam Latin cross and the Orthodox cross, also known as the Suppedaneum cross, which has another bar near the bottom) to roadside memorials and, of course, church steeples. But the actual crosses Romans used for executions probably took a different shape. The Greek and Latin words for \"cross\" — \"stauros\" and \"crux\" — do not necessarily describe what most people imagine as a cross. They refer to an upright stake upon which the condemned could be bound with hands above their heads. Most historians surmise that Jesus’ cross was more likely to have been T-shaped, with the vertical element notched to allow executioners to tie the victim to the crossbeam, then raise it and set it securely into the top. The Tau cross, named for its resemblance to the Greek letter, has been adopted over time by various Christian orders and sects, and it probably bears a stronger resemblance to the object upon which Jesus died on than those crosses more commonly depicted in Christian art. Nearly every depiction of Jesus’ crucifixion — including masterpieces such as Sandro Botticelli’s \"Mystic Crucifixion\" and Diego Velázquez’s \"Christ Crucified\" — shows Him attached to the cross by nails through his palms and his feet. The New Testament Gospels do not, however, directly say that Jesus was nailed to the cross. In fact, the only reference to such nails in the Gospels comes from the book of John and the story of doubting Thomas, who asks to see the marks of the nails in Jesus’ hands to confirm that he is really encountering the resurrected Christ (John 20:25). The tradition that Jesus was nailed to the cross may also derive from the passage in some translations of Psalm 21:16 that says, \"They pierce my hands and feet.\" Yet, while some physical evidence for nailing the feet of crucifixion victims has been found by archaeologists, it would have been impossible to fix the condemned to a cross by nails alone, since the bones in the hands or wrists would not have supported the weight of the body. Rather, Romans would have at least also tied victims’ wrists to the crossbeam, or perhaps draped their arms over the back of the beam and secured them with ropes. Suffocation, rather than loss of blood, would be the cause of death. The Gospel of John states that Jesus bore the cross by himself (John 19:17) to a hill called Golgotha, while the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke claim that authorities compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, to carry the cross for Him, presumably because the flogging He had received had left Him too weak to carry it. In either case, most depictions in Christian art (including renditions by Michelangelo, El Greco and Titian) show either man carrying a large, wooden cross with both a vertical and a horizontal beam. Yet Romans generally had the upright beam already set up at the place of execution. To the extent that the condemned carried their own crosses, they would have been given only the horizontal piece, according to historians of ancient execution methods, including LaGrange College professor John Granger Cook. \"For almost 1,000 years, the Christian church emphasized paradise, not Crucifixion,\" two authors wrote in UU World magazine; in Slate, scholar Larry Hurtado claimed that \"there was, in short, little to be gained in proclaiming a crucified saviour in that setting in which crucifixion was a grisly reality,\" noting that \"some early Christians tried to avoid reference to Jesus’ crucifixion.\" It is true that crosses were extremely rare symbols for Christians to use before the mid-4th century. Moreover, the first images of crosses portray them more as slender, gemmed staffs than as sturdy instruments of execution. Depictions of Jesus’ crucifixion were even more rare, not occurring with any regularity until the 6th century. Yet there’s a reason this is surprising: Christian authors, poets and preachers wrote and spoke at great length about the significance and meaning of Jesus’ death on the cross. In the 2nd century, Christian thinker Justin Martyr wrote that \"when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted His garments among themselves,\" emphasizing the humiliation and suffering of Jesus’ execution in a long dialogue with a non-Christian interlocutor. Tertullian, another prolific early Christian writer, also meditated at length on the crucifixion and its theological meaning. While explaining the cross or crucifix’s absence from visual art may be difficult, timing its appearance with the rise of pilgrimage to the Holy Land and the sites of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection provides helpful clues. By the end of the 4th century, pilgrims were traveling to Jerusalem, where they could visit Golgotha and venerate a relic of the \"true cross,\" supposedly discovered by the Roman Empress Helena. Some even were privileged to receive a fragment of the holy wood. The image of the cross and the crucifix may be linked with pilgrims’ desire to re-create the scene in its historical setting, and the proliferation of cross images in the West may have to do with the cross-related souvenirs some pilgrims brought back. This idea has some convinced followers. According to Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, various authorities \"have linked the cross with nature worship and pagan sex rites.\" The Church of the Great God, another denomination, likewise claims that \"long before the coming of Christ, pagans used the cross as a religious symbol.\" Yet there is no evidence that Christians intentionally borrowed the cross from pre-Christian cultic symbols. While it is true that many ancient religions used symbols similar to the cross (and that Egyptian Christians even adapted the ankh, a hieroglyph for \"life\"), two intersecting lines are a simple and very common figure. This makes it difficult to assert that early Christians consciously adopted a particular sign rather than inventing one specifically referring to their unique story of Jesus’ death upon a cross.

            "Topic: Rio 2016 – will Brazil be ready for the Olympics?\n",
            "Paragraph: Rio de Janeiro. The type of city that never fails to look good on television. The carnival city, sandwiched between sea and sheer cliffs, a city that lives for ball games, beach life and beautiful views. It should, then, be the perfect Olympic city too, a sporting mecca in a continent that has never hosted an Olympic Games. So why, with just 30 days to go, are people so concerned about what might happen? With people both inside Brazil and around the world in desperate need for something to cheer about, why are there so many worried frowns? And can anything be done to save the successor to London 2012? Are the Rio Olympic venues ready? Rio 2016 is split across four different zones across the city. The largest, the Olympic Park in Barra, just west of Rio, is, to put it graciously, a work in progress. When we visit, just a week before the BBC and the rest of the world's media are due to move in, the area is an open expanse of concrete, lorries and white tents surrounding venues that are supposedly complete, but in reality still have plenty of work to do. What's certainly lacking is some much-needed carnival colour. What the Olympic Park should look like... What it actually looks like... We visited the Aquatics Centre and the basketball venues, two stadia that have been completed. The swimming pool had water, but scaffolding still covered the upper tiers. Visible wiring round the spectator concourse of the basketball venue suggested at the very least a stripped back approach to venue construction. The delayed velodrome meanwhile was only signed off by the builders on Sunday 26 June. The first time spectators will actually enter the venue will be on the first day of competition. \"Of course there are still question marks and challenges as to how the venue will perform,\" said Rodrigo Garcia, sport director for Rio 2016 . However, he added that the 45 test events held across the Olympic venues, some with spectators and some without, give him confidence that the Park will deliver. \"We have really simple venues, we’re not planning fancy stadiums here in Rio,\" he said. \"We cannot go against the financial crisis that Brazil is living through today. There is no extra budget for us to expand on what should be in place for the Games.\" For the first time this year, there is a new way to see what’s going on inside the Olympic Park. Google Street View have been mapping the whole area, including inside the venues themselves. It’s a neat concept, giving spectators who can't make it to Rio a Bolt's Eye View of the action. Except not all the venues are ready for Google’s 360-degree, 15-camera backpack to come and shoot. \"Some venues haven’t been photographed because they are not ready yet. We have everything set to do things before the Olympics.\" said Google Brazil Partnerships spokesperson Carlos Aranha. We can't wait to poke around the rest. Why are they cutting it so fine? Quite simply, because Rio and Brazil are facing the worst economic recession in their history, worse even than the Wall Street Crash, say organisers. With fewer than 50 days to go until the Opening Ceremony, the city of Rio declared a \"state of public calamity\" , warning that without an injection of cash they would not be able to honour their commitment to the Games – or, for that matter, keep public health, security and education services running. If it sounds alarmist, that's because it is. The move immediately triggered additional investment from Brazil's federal government. Add to that a political crisis which saw the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in May , a collapse in oil prices and a rise in violence in the city, and you start to realise that putting on a Games is the least of Brazil's problems. That said, at no point during my trip did I, as a tourist, feel at risk, any more so than I would walking around London. Don't forget either, that with just two weeks to go until London 2012, the Army was called in after G4S confirmed they would not be able to provide enough private security guards. Rio isn't the first Olympic city to face doom-laden predictions, and it won't be the last. But Rio's problems far outweigh London's from four years ago. \"Many people ask us, ‘Wow, you’re in a lot of trouble’,\" said Rio 2016 communications director Adriana Garcia. \"Yes, we are, that’s true. We’re very transparent about it. \"Brazil is melting,\" she said. \"We have the worst political and economic crisis ever. We are facing a very challenging environment but we are confident that we will deliver a Games that will make people hopeful of a better situation.\" The total cost of the Games currently stands at 39 billion Brazilian reais – roughly $4.6 billion. That is far less than the $15 billion price tag of London 2012 \"It may not be the luxury site that people want,\" said Garcia. \"But it’s what we have, it’s what we offer, it’s going to be the Frugal Games.\" Will the Games make people happy? Philip Wilkinson is the international media manager for Rio 2016. Four years ago, he was on the communications team for Team GB, before he decided to follow the Games to South America. \"Brazilians are passionate about sport, and the city of Rio lends itself to it,\" he said. \"It’s surrounded by the ocean, the forest, the mountains, that lends itself to outdoor activities. It’s the perfect place to host the Games.\" Ipanema Beach in Rio De Janiero, the perfect backdrop to the Games? He's right, Rio is seemingly full of athletes, from kids playing footvolley on the beach to hardened cyclists winding their way up to Christ the Redeemer. Security in the Barra Olympic Park But that doesn't mean everyone thinks the Games is money well spent. This is just the latest in a series of mega events that began with the Pan American Games in 2007, through to the World Cup in 2014. As always, debate is fierce surrounding the 'Olympic legacy'. In Rio, it's all about transport, an effort to solve the city's crippling traffic problems. \"There are projects that have been wanted for 30 or 40 years and have been gathering dust,\" said Wilkinson. \"Like the new Metro line connecting the west with the centre of the city. Like the four new bus rapid transit lines.\" The metro is yet to be finished. Another legacy project, the cleaning of the polluted harbour where the sailing will take place, has already been canned. \"The bay won’t be cleaned as promised,\" said Garcia. \"When Brazil won the bid it promised that it would clean 80 per cent of the bay. Only 40 per cent will be cleaned.\" But, she assured me, the sailors taking part in the Games will \"be able to compete in the best situation possible\". The Olympics brings other things, of course. Google has not just been photographing the inside of stadia. The company has been re-mapping the city for locals and tourists, as well as working with NGO Affroreggae to map some of Rio's bewildering favelas, highlighting local businesses and showing that there's another side to these poor neighbourhoods. In the end, it's not for outside broadcasters – who come in, marvel at the views, marvel at the sport – to decide whether the Olympics is money well spent. That's for Rio locals, the 'cariocas', to hold the organisers to account. \"The Olympic Games is designed to overcome whatever else is happening in the world,\" says BBC commentator and former athlete Brendan Foster, a veteran of 12 Olympic Games. \"Rio has followed the script. The stadiums won't be ready, there's disease, the public are turning their back, the country's facing economic disaster, all the sports face drugs issues, there's security, terrorism, all those things.\" \"The Olympics has become a worldwide spectacle haunted by world-impacting problems,\" he added. \"Brazil is finding it tough, and is already finding it tough. But these Games will rise beyond all those issues. What happens is sport takes over. We go there not to measure the strength of the Brazilian government; we go there to share in the greatest athletes in the world doing their thing.\" For Brazil's sake, let's hope he's right.\n",

            "Paragraph: The California city of San Rafael might be one of the more beautiful places in the country, but if you’re a smoker, it might not be the place for you. Last week, the San Francisco suburb made active a smoking ban that officials say is the strictest in the country, prohibiting smoking cigarettes in your own home. The ordinance specifically bans smoking in dwellings that share a wall with another unit, including apartments, duplexes and condominiums. The hope is to eliminate second-hand smoke from creeping through doors and windows, ventilation systems, floorboards and other susceptible openings. According to a U.S. Surgeon General report, secondhand smoke kills about 50,000 Americans per year, including 430 infants. The San Rafael City Council unanimously approved the ban last year. \"I'm not aware of any ordinance that's stronger,\" said Rebecca Woodbury, an analyst at the City Manager’s office, to ABC. \"It doesn't matter if it's owner-occupied or renter-occupied. We didn't want to discriminate. The distinguishing feature is the shared wall.\" While California outlawed smoking in bars, clubs and restaurants in 1995, the San Rafael ban is the first to move the restrictions inside the home -- a move that the American Lung Association called \"groundbreaking.\" \"This legislation will improve the health of all Californians by reducing exposure to smoke that drifts into housing units from balconies, patios, and other units,\" said the association's president and CEO, Jane Warner. But not everyone celebrated the move. \"This...smoking ban actually intends to punish people for what they do in their own homes,\" said San Rafael resident Thomas Ruppenthal to the council. \"I really feel this is tyranny.\" Some housing advocates also spoke out against the ban, claiming that it targeted low-income earners, The Sacramento Bee reported: Brian Augusta, of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, said that targeting multifamily units disproportionately affects low-income people who can't afford standalone homes. \"If smoking is an addiction, and it clearly is, are we telling people that they have to quit smoking - without support - or leave their homes?\" he said. In the same article, Kimberly Amazeen of the American Lung Association offered a rebuttal. \"The real discrimination is against low-income families who can't escape exposure to deadly secondhand smoke,\" she said, \"and they can't find another place to live because of their income or health.\"\n",

            "Topic: 9 ways the new \"Beauty and the Beast\" is different from the original\n",
            "Paragraph: As everyone returned to work Monday morning, it’s safe to assume rooms were buzzing with discussions about the highly anticipated \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake that debuted over the weekend. Some may have been covering their ears, while others thoroughly examined each and every detail -- good or bad -- of the live-action update of the 1991 animated classic. So how did the remake compare to the original? Well, that’s still up for interpretation, but one thing is clear: There were many plot twists and updates that gave the newly released \"Beauty and Beast\" a completely different feel from the original. Questions were answered, characters changed and some key scenes and moments in the film made the remake stand out -- not simply as a copycat but as a film that can stand on its own. Here’s a look at nine ways the \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake differed from the original: Warning: This post contains spoilers. In the remake, Belle (Emma Watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she’s also a teacher and inventor. It’s clear Belle is one of the only literate women in town. While other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, Belle’s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she’s not ashamed of it. In fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so. She held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. Rather than washing the clothes by hand, Belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town. In the original \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the audience simply knows \"crazy Maurice\" (Kevin Kline) as a widower and Belle as his apparent caretaker. It was never clear who Belle’s mother was or what happened to her. But thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. With a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the Beast (Dan Stevens) and Belle travel back in time to Paris, where Belle was born. The pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. It’s \"much smaller\" than Belle imagined. It’s here the Beast tells Belle what happened to her mother. After spotting a doctor’s mask on the floor, the Beast concludes Belle’s mother died from the plague. A flashback between Maurice and Belle’s mom (Zoe Rainey), sick in bed, saying their farewells proves this to be the case. The woman tells Maurice to take Belle away so she doesn’t catch the disease as well. So he does, and the rest is history. The Beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn’t always that way. In the 1991 animated movie, the audience assumes the Beast was born like that, his attitude simply accompanying the crown. In the remake, we found out that’s not entirely the case. While Belle asks Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) and some others why they remain loyal to the Beast, they explain that they failed him when he was a boy. The Beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. Therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never \"protected\" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a \"Beast\" well before his physical transformation. It’s true. Lyrics to one of the movie’s most popular songs, \"Gaston,\" sounded a little different than the original. While they were new to moviegoers, \"Beauty and the Beast\" composer Alan Menken said they weren’t technically \"new\" -- they were simply unused lyrics by the late Howard Ashman that didn’t make the cut in the original film. \"[They’re] not actually new lyrics, they’re actually Howard Ashman’s that were outtake things,\" Menken told ComicBook prior to the premiere in Los Angeles. \"We had also put some of the outtake lyrics from Howard in the Broadway show. And the reason that they hadn’t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy.\" For example, the added lyric \"I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver and I shoot in the liver\" was too edgy for an animated film, but for this one, Menken said it was perfect. Unlike in the original, the new Beast is highly educated, boasting about his expensive education while quoting Shakespeare and critiquing Belle’s admiration for \"Romeo and Juliet.\" This is a sharp contrast from the original movie, where a bored and seemingly illiterate Beast needed Belle’s help sounding out words in the books. The Beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with Belle that his huge library really is wonderful. The Beast doesn’t need any help reading a book, and Belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point. What happened to Mrs. Potts’ children, Chip’s brothers and sisters? While Chip (Nathan Mack) has always been front and center, it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn’t alone. In the original film, Mrs. Potts told Chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet. This time around, Chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings. We assume, this time around, he’s Mrs. Potts’ only child. Not cool, Gaston (Luke Evans). While trying to win the affection of his \"future father-in-law,\" Gaston pretends to believe Maurice’s warning that a strange Beast has taken his daughter, Belle, captive. So he and LeFou (Josh Gad) take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night, asking Maurice to lead the way. When Maurice approaches the path to the Beast’s castle, he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again. Gaston and LeFou exchange glances, implying that Maurice has lost it, and tell him it’s time to turn around. But Maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. Gaston loses his temper with Maurice and says he only entertained Maurice’s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. When Maurice says that will never happen, Gaston realizes Maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves. LeFou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving Maurice for dead, pleads with Gaston to reconsider, but Gaston pushes forward and returns to town without Maurice. Little does he know, Maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how Gaston left him there to die. If only they believed him... The live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake made history by featuring Disney’s first-ever \"exclusively gay moment.\" In the new film, Josh Gad’s character, LeFou -- Gaston’s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version. \"LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,\" director Bill Condon told Attitude magazine. \"He’s confused about what he wants. It’s somebody who’s just realising that he has these feelings.\" At one point in the film, Gaston asks LeFou why he doesn’t have a lady. LeFou shrugs his shoulders and says he’s \"too clingy.\" At the end of the movie, LeFou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with Belle and the prince. He starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of Gaston’s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup. In the 1991 animated movie, the Beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. In the remake, there’s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before \"the last petal falls,\" referring to the enchanted rose. And in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the Beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as Belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. At that moment, it appears the curse is final. Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes. Belle take a long pause before finally telling the Beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek. Behind her stands the transforming enchantress, who originally placed the curse on the Beast and his castle. As she overhears Belle’s last cry, she lifts the curse, bringing the Beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves. The enchantress then disappears without a trace. \n",

            "Paragraph: Every day at around 3 p.m., my brain gets weary. I've tried numerous techniques to counter this challenge: Coffee (especially when McDonald's was giving away free smalls) Splashing cold water on my face Wandering around online Snacking Yet I've found one technique to be the most effective: going for a walk. The longest stroll I've taken is around 10 minutes, and I just wander around the block. I pass by the open hotel lobby that's air-conditioned in the summer and heated in the winter. By the students on their way to and from art school. By storeowners, by late lunchers, by buildings under construction and their builders, by many things. I've even run into friends around the block. I look forward to this break every day. Not because I don't like what I'm doing, but because my brain is just fried and I'm hitting the afternoon hump. On days I don't take it, I feel like I'm doing my employer or client an injustice -- because I can't give them my brain's full output that they deserve. Even recently, when the temperature dropped down to -30 Celsius, I bundled up and wandered outside -- and into Toronto's underground tunnel system.

            "Topic: To Increase Test Scores, Schools Should Stop Suspending Students, Says Study\n",
            "Paragraph: To raise students’ test scores, schools should stop pushing out troublesome students, argues a new report. A recent report published in December’s issue of the American Sociological Review finds that students in schools with high rates of suspensions suffer academically -– even if they are not being suspended themselves. The report, compiled by University of Indiana professor Brea Perry and University of Kentucky professor Edward Morris, concludes that high rates of suspensions can have a negative impact on the test scores of students who have not been suspended, and that schools may be better served by only suspending students in moderation. Evidence shows that high incarceration rates can have a devastating impact on offenders, as well as on surrounding families and communities. The researchers set out to see if a similar tactic would yield the same results in schools -– if high rates of suspension could negatively impact other students' academic achievement. To glean their results, researchers followed about 16,000 middle school and high school students in a Kentucky district over the course of six semesters. They tracked the students’ scores on a statewide test administered three times a year, and compared it to their schools’ suspension rates during the time of test taking. Researchers controlled for factors that are correlated with a school’s suspension rate, like poverty. They also adjusted for factors like the annual number of drug infractions in a school, violent infractions and incidents of disruptive behavior, so that a school’s normal level of crime would not confound \"the association between suspension and achievement,\" says the report. Perry told The Huffington Post the researchers adjusted for these factors so that \"any effect suspension has is over and above those events occurring. We wanted to find if something about the punishment itself ... is harmful to students above and beyond the disruption of being in a high violent context.\" Researchers found that high rates of school suspensions had a substantial negative impact on individual students' test scores –- especially in schools with typically low levels of violence. \"Low and moderate levels of suspension are benign ... there is no benefit or harm,\" said Perry. But when the suspension levels become \"excessive,\" it starts to affect \"the achievement of non-suspended students.\" She continued, \"[Excessive suspension caused] negative consequences in all schools, but it was especially harmful when the level of violence in school is low. ... Suspension is most detrimental when it is probably perceived by students as illegitimate, overused or used inappropriate. Kids are looking around saying, ‘This is happening way too often, things in school are great, and you’re using suspension.’\" According to the report, when a school with typically low levels of violence experiences high rates of suspension, \"the predicted percentile score in reading achievement decreases from about 54th at the mean level of suspension to 28th at very high levels of suspension.\" Overall, researchers conclude that high suspension rates \"can create a heightened sense of anxiety\" for students and that \"turnover of suspended students in and out of classrooms creates unstable, socially fragmented environments.\" Suspension rate disparities in the studied district mirrored national suspension disparities –- meaning that African-American students were disproportionately suspended at the same rates reflected in national data. The research demonstrates that suspension should be used as a last resort, limited to situations where the safety of students is threatened, said Perry. She noted that a school used in the study recently implemented its own suspension diversion program, in which misbehaving students were asked to sit and do homework rather than being sent away. She says the school saw an increase in test scores. \"There’s nothing good about [suspension] for suspended kids, but also nothing good about it for non-suspended kids,\" said Perry.\n",

The couple were together for just three months in a highly publicised relationship over the summer. Speaking to PEOPLE at the Emmys, Tom revealed that the two were still friendly. Asked if they were amicable, Tom said: \"Yes. Yes, we are.\" Taylor was criticised after moving on from Calvin Harris so quickly after they split, but it looks like Tom isn't mending much of a broken heart. The Night Manager star attended last night's Emmy Awards, where he was spotted getting close with actress Priyanka Chopra. According to E! News , multiple witnesses saw the pair both \"openly flirting with each other\" at an afterparty. \"Tom had his arm around her and held her close. Afterwards, Tom and Priyanka talked closely and were holding hands at one point for a few moments,\" said an insider. \"Priyanka fixed Tom's bow-tie and then the two kissed on both cheeks.\" Apparently, Tom was so taken by the former Miss World star that he put his number into the Quantico star's phone. \"Priyanka and Tom said goodbye and she told him that she will see him later,\" added the source. \"They left the event about a minute after each other.\" Tom's appearance on the red carpet last night was his first since he officially broke things off with Taylor. The British actor, who was nominated for his role as Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager, looked dapper as he joined his co-stars Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman on the red carpet. Shortly before the big night, a source claimed that Tom was dreading the thought of bumping into his ex at an afterparty. \"He is still shellshocked over their split and just setting eyes on her could send him into a tailspin,\" claimed an insider.\n",

            "Paragraph: WASHINGTON -- Rep. Lee Terry (R-Neb.) said on Thursday that he is against military intervention in Syria, even though his \"gut feeling\" is that the Syrian government now possesses chemical weapons that came from fallen Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussain. Terry, who has served in the House since 1999, supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In an interview on Thursday with Omaha radio host Tom Becka, Terry said Syria was a completely different situation. \"The theory then and the evidence was that Iraq was an enemy of the United States and had direct plans in either support of al Qaeda and/or with other weapons that we found out weren’t there -- which I still think they were moved to Syria,\" said Terry. \"And it wouldn’t surprise me if some of the chemical weapons that have been used by Syria actually came from Iraq.\" There is no evidence that Hussein sent weapons of mass destruction to Syria. When Becka asked whether Terry's claim about the transfer of weapons was based on information he had received as a member of Congress, Terry replied, \"Gut feeling. Yeah, I have not had any classified briefing, but all we know that Iraq had ... chemical and biological weapons and then they weren’t there. ... It wasn’t that the U.S. was guessing; that was something that they had actually declared. But they went someplace.\" Terry, however, is not the first to make this claim; it's been circulating for years among supporters of an invasion. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he believed the transfer was \"entirely possible\" in a 2007 interview. Many proponents of this theory cite an October 2003 statement by James Clapper, Jr., who was leading the National Imagery and Mapping Agency at the time and later became the Director of National Intelligence. ''I think people below the Saddam Hussein-and-his-sons level saw what was coming and decided the best thing to do was to destroy and disperse,'' said Clapper, adding that \"the obvious conclusion one draws\" is that there ''may have been people leaving the scene, fleeing Iraq, and unquestionably, I am sure, material.\" The New York Times noted in 2003 that Clapper had been providing a \"personal assessment,\" and a spokesman for his agency \"could not provide further evidence to support the general's statement.\" In 2005, the CIA’s top weapons inspector in Iraq and head of the Iraq Study Group, Charles Duelfer, said while it was possible there had been such a transfer, they had failed to find any proof of this theory. From the ISG report: The investigation centered on the possibility that WMD materials were moved to Syria. ... ISG found no senior policy, program, or intelligence officials who admitted any direct knowledge of such movement of WMD. Indeed, they uniformly denied any knowledge of residual WMD that could have been secreted to Syria. [...] Based on the evidence available at present, ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place. However, ISG was unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited WMD-related materials. The ISG also concluded, \"While a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: A man has finally managed catch Pokémons and since this is a news that’s of national emergency, we decided to showcase it immediately to help all the Pokemon Go players out there strategize their search better. Brooklyn based Nick Johnson, found all 142 Pokémon available in New York making him the first man to literally ‘Catch ‘Em All’. Though the actual series has 151 Pokémons, nobody really knows the whereabouts of the rest (or the existence of them at all). In an interview with Business Insider, Johnsons shared some tips on what he did to win all of it. He chose water-type Squirtle as his first Pokemon because he didn’t realize that he had a choice. He would have gone with the fire-type Charmander, in reflection of his choice of Team Valor, the game’s red team. The very last Pokemon he needed for his collection was Omastar, which he evolved himself. He says that he would have caught it a day earlier when two appeared in his vicinity – but then Verizon cell service cut out for 15 minutes, denying him of his prize. \"Shout out to Verizon, you the real MVP,\" Johnson jokes. The second-to-last Pokemon that Johnson needed, Porygon, was also the hardest, and required a trip to Jersey City. \"I may or may not have seen it on the radar and then ordered an Uber to drive me around until I found it,\" Johnson says. The best spots in New York City for catching Pokemon are Battery Park and Grand Army Plaza in Central Park. The latter is where Justin Bieber was spotted playing, and on any given night, there are 300 or so people gathered there for Pokemon hunting purposes, staying \"well until the morning.\" His best tip for would-be Pokemon masters: \"Buy some good walking shoes.\" He also recommends that if you’re going to spend real money for in-game items, then the egg incubators are the best bang for your buck. And now, the BIG question. What happens when you catch ’em all? Well, NOTHING. The game just ends there. No reward, nothing! Well, the biggest reward could be the fact that it’s got people to get out of their houses and actually walk, but a good compensation would have worked well too, you know. So how far are you?\n",

            "Paragraph: Just before her 42nd birthday, at 28 weeks pregnant, Kimberly Fugate went into labor. As if that weren’t shocking enough, Kimberly didn’t even realize she was pregnant until she was 13 weeks along. The news that she would be having triplets was the cherry on top. With little time to get ready for her three babies, Kimberly and husband Craig were hardly prepared for what happened in the delivery room. \"It’s all been rather overwhelming when you think about how many changes will have to be made,\" Kimberly tells People. \"But I am just trying to take everything one day at a time. I know it will all work out.\" Sometimes, pregnancies go from ordinary to extraordinary in an instant. Another couple, Sarah and Bill Imbierowicz, unexpectedly had two sets of triplets! Rather than take it as an unexpected burden or hurdle, they took it as a blessing. In 2013, Kimberly Fugate became pregnant in her early 40s. The mom, who was already a mother to a 10-year-old, Katelyn, was suddenly expecting triplets — rare triplets at that. She and her husband, Craig, conceived the babies without IVF. That’s almost unheard of! Just before her 42nd birthday, after delivering three identical girls, doctors told her there was a little more in store. \"They had gotten the three out, and they said, ‘More feet,'\" Kimberly told CNN. \"I said, ‘No!’ It was an instant shock.\" Kimberly and Craig had produced four identical quadruplet girls. Their names and birth order: Kenleigh Rosa, Kristen Sue, Kayleigh Pearl, and Kelsey Roxanne.\n",
            " The odds of conceiving spontaneous quadruplets are 1 to 729,000. However, the odds that they would be identical are almost incalculable at about 13 million to one. Their doctor, James Bofill, was baffled! \"I was very embarrassed, obviously,\" James said. \"The news was sent to me by one of my fellows. I thought she was kidding.\" A year after delivering the babies, Kimberly told Today that she is loving motherhood: \"Just getting up in the morning and seeing the smiles on their faces, hearing them coo at me, and listening to them babble at each other — the joy is overwhelming. I know every mom is partial to her babies, but I feel like I have the prettiest babies with the prettiest smiles. And those dimples... \"The babies were the biggest surprise of my life, and I couldn’t imagine my life without them.\" \"I believed that God picked me to have these quadruplets, and I felt that He would take care of them and allow them to survive. To see how far they’ve come makes me feel very blessed,\" she added. \"I feel very lucky, like the luckiest mom in the whole world. I wasn’t planning on starting over with more children, and many things have changed since I had my quadruplets, Kenleigh, Kristen, Kayleigh and Kelsey.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Right or wrong, porn has been blamed for all sorts of social ills, from perpetuating sexist attitudes to destroying relationships. But does porn affect the brains of men who watch it? To answer that question, German researchers recruited 64 men between the ages of 21 and 45 who watched an average of four hours of pornography per week. The researchers did MRI scans of men’s brains while showing them a mixture of sexually explicit images and non-sexual imagery. Their research was published May 28 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. \"Our findings indicated that gray matter volume of the right caudate of the striatum is smaller with higher pornography use,\" the researchers wrote in the journal article, referring to an area of the brain associated with reward processing and motivation. Men who watched more porn also showed less activity in another area of the striatum, called the left putamen, which usually lights up in response to sexual images. Heavy porn consumers also had a weaker connection between the striatum and the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with decision-making. \"Dysfunction of this circuitry has been related to inappropriate behavioral choices, such as drug seeking, regardless of the potential negative outcome,\" the researchers wrote in the article. Yikes. So does that mean porn can really shrink guys' brains? Not necessarily, the researchers say. \"It's not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads to brain changes or whether people born with certain brain types watch more porn,\" study author Dr. Simone Kühn of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin told Reuters in an email. Kuhn and her colleagues said they hoped future studies would reveal how \"excessive porn consumption\" may affect the brain over time, and how it affects the brains of new viewers. Until then, the jury's still out on porn's effect on the brain. \"Everything is going to be bad in excess and it’s probably not terrible in moderation,\" Dr. Gregory Tau, a psychiatry professor at Columbia University who was not involved in the new research, told Reuters.\n",

            "Paragraph: In cases of pain like headache or back soreness, what most Americans do is reach for painkillers, and more often than not, they opt for Ibuprofen (Advil). It works like a charm, taking away any pain you have in such a short amount of time. What is there not to love, right? But what about safety? People might be comforted into thinking it is ok, since it is a legal over-the-counter drug. But what people are not aware of is that there are some serious health risks associated with even casual use of the drug. Of those risks, one of the most concerning is the potential for heart damage. Even The FDA is Warning You Even the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been issuing warnings about this drug for the last 11 years emphasizing the dangers of heart damage and failure. The FDA rarely does this, but since recently they decided to become more vocal about the potential dangers of Ibuprofen so they conducted another series of researches and published the following statements: – Even with short term use, one’s heart attack and stroke risk increase significantly. – This risk increases the longer one continues to use ibuprofen. – You do not need to have an existing heart condition to be at risk, although such a condition does increase your chances. Additionally, the FDA categorized people over 40 as the more vulnerable group since 40 is the age at which one’s heart disease begins to skyrocket What is especially alarming is the fact that the FDA has a history of approving some seriously questionable drugs, but even they are waving red flags when it comes to this drug. Don’t Be Fooled One of the biggest problems with over-the-counter drugs like Ibuprofen is that people generally think they pose no major risk so they just shrug and pop pills whenever they think they need to. Hopefully, the information we shared will change your mind in that regard. However, we’re not going to leave you hanging without at least one alternative option for pain relief. Welcome Natural Painkillers! Turmeric, for example, is a plant related to the ginger family. It has a natural ability to block inflammatory cytokines and enzymes and actually prevent inflammation. This is the opposite of most pharmaceutical drugs that only work on reducing inflammation. There are plenty cases, like with rheumatoid arthritis, when turmeric can deliver much better results than any pharmaceutical equivalent.\n",

It came as a shock to Hayley, that's for sure. \"Apparently cats NEED to be trained to do this. Makes you wonder about his past history!

An audit in mid-April concluded the program improved productivity and worker health, and reduced absenteeism, The New York Times recently reported As one employee told the publication, \"a happy worker is a better worker,\" and the report added to a chorus of social scientists calling for fewer hours to boost work output. Can that formula be replicated across the Atlantic? Corporate coach Annie Perrin agrees that when companies make an effort to make their workers happy, it pays off. \"What the evidence suggests overwhelmingly is that the more organizations invest in their people, the more the people are going to invest back into the organization,\" she said in a recent interview with CNBC's \" \"What the evidence suggests overwhelmingly is that the more organizations invest in their people, the more the people are going to invest back into the organization,\" she said in a recent interview with CNBC's \" Power Lunch .\" The concept of a shorter workday could succeed, she said, as long as employees are intensely focused and working for those 30 hours. \"We don't think about measuring work that much in terms of hours. That's only one-half of the equation. The other half is the energy that you bring to those six hours of work,\" said Perrin, who has worked with companies like Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) as executive vice president at the Energy Project. The firm aims to create workplaces that are \"healthier, happier and higher performing,\" according to its website.

            "Paragraph: The governor of Alabama appointed his own state’s Attorney General, Luther Strange, Thursday to fill the Senate seat left vacant by former senator Jeff Sessions taking over President Donald Trump’s Justice Department. \"This is truly a remarkable time in our state’s history,\" said Gov. Robert Bentley, who came into office with Strange after the 2010 election. The two men worked together to forge the state’s 2015 $2 billion settlement with BP after that company’s massive 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Strange was chosen after the governor and the Alabama Republican Party Executive Committee spent 20 hours interviewing potential appointees, beginning in the fall after Trump announced Sessions was his choice for DOJ. \"Alabama has surely been well represented by Senator Sessions, and I am confident Senator Strange will serve as a fine representative for our people,\" the governor said. \"His leadership on a national level, service as a statewide elected official, and long record of taking on tough federal issues are the very qualities that will make him a strong conservative Senator for Alabama.\" Senators confirmed their colleague to be U.S. Attorney General Wednesday evening, 52-to-47, with Sessions voting present and Sen.

            "Topic: 'Lone Survivor' Director Peter Berg Remembers When A Woman Threw Up During 'Very Bad Things'\n",
            "Paragraph: It's fascinating that Peter Berg directed \"Lone Survivor.\" Fascinating only in the respect that Berg's previous movie, \"Battleship,\" was also a military themed film, yet \"Battleship and \"Lone Survivor\" could not be more different from one another. But that's the thing about Berg: his films are hard to, let's say, pin down. A story he tells ahead about his directorial debut, \"Very Bad Things,\" pretty much illustrates exactly that: In the theater, he hears people laughing; outside, he sees a woman vomiting. The same man who directed the theatrical version of \"Friday Night Lights\" also directed \"Hancock\" and the aforementioned \"Battleship.\" Berg refers to his early directing style as \"creatively reckless.\" It might also be an apt phrase for his filmography. Berg's latest, \"Lone Survivor,\" is the true story of four Navy SEALs (played by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch) ambushed by the Taliban in 2005. The film is based on a book by former SEAL Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), and Berg makes \"Lone Survivor\" an almost overwhelming re-creation of those events. I met Berg at an Upper West Side hotel where we talked about \"Lone Survivor,\" his lingering disappointment with the box-office results for \"Battleship,\" and that poor woman who threw up at the premiere of \"Very Bad Things.\" This is an intense movie. It made me feel physically tired. Yeah, that was one of all of our goals for everyone involved in the film -- to put someone into the experience of what these guys went through. And it was obviously a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience. The first two acts especially do make you feel like you're with them. Is there a trick to doing that? What might be the kind of secret ingredient, if you will, is the amount of research we all did before we ever started shooting. I spent two years developing this script and I got to go to Iraq and embed with the Navy SEAL platoon for a month. And I spent a of of time with Marcus Luttrell and a lot of time with the families of the soldiers who were killed. I feel there's a misconception that this movie isn't for the squeamish. It's intense, but the violence isn't something that will make a normal person feel sick. I think it's the totality of the intensity of the experience. Because it really happened -- and we stayed true to what really happened -- it feels much more gruesome, visually, than it really is. People have asked me about it: \"It's such a gruesome, bloody film.\" Well, not really. Go look at a \"Saw\" movie -- it's nothing like that. The scenes where the group is falling down the side of a mountain is exemplified by the sounds being made when they hit a tree. What was used to make that sound? It's hitting trees. Really? Yeah. So people who were mic'd up? Yeah, people mic'd. Our sound designer, Wylie Stateman, is phenomenal ... his crew of sound freaks just go out and recreate these sounds. Taylor Kitsch is really good in this movie. I feel he got some heat for \"John Carter\" and your last film, \"Battleship.\" I don't know how you feel about that ... Look, I love Taylor Kitsch. I'll work with him as long as he'll work with me. You know, he had a rough year. Anybody who has a career in this business is going to have highs and lows. He was thrust into two big budget features. Jettisoned into these two huge films, which, you know, had mixed results, obviously. But the thing I like about him is that he never looked back. He never complained. He never felt sorry for himself. He said, \"What's next? Let's keep working.\" Of all of your films, are you most proud of \"Lone Survivor\"? I'm very proud of it. It hasn't come out yet, but I feel like, in some ways, it has. I've never had such a satisfied experience making a film. I have been in the minority as supporter of \"Battleship,\" but I have wondered if you were you surprised that it didn't do well? You know, it was obvious early on that there was a large majority of critics that had it out for that film, based on just concept alone. I wasn't completely shocked that we had trouble performing domestically. The film performed very well internationally. You know, it is what it is. I still quote \"Mahalo, bitch.\" Wait, no ... [Laughs] \"Mahalo, motherfucker!\" Of course I get it wrong in front of you. And we had a 90-year-old Navy vet who says, \"Let's drop some lead on these motherfuckers.\" That was my favorite line. That was his line, too, \"Let's drop some lead on these motherfuckers!\" I've grown an appreciation for your first movie, \"Very Bad Things,\" since I first saw it. I get reactions a lot from people who just found it. Generally, what's consistent is there's a very, very strong reaction. It's very polarizing. People either got it and went with it, or they were just completely repulsed by it. It was my first film and I was very creatively reckless and was doing anything I wanted to do. But creatively reckless can be a good thing. Oh, I think so, too. I look at \"The Hangover\" and I look at us as the grandfather of \"The Hangover.\" When you first saw \"The Hangover,\" did you feel like you had already made that movie? I mean, I think \"The Hangover\" was really funny. Bradley Cooper in \"The Hangover\" is more likable than Christian Slater in \"Very Bad Things.\" A little bit, yeah. We pushed it. I knew \"Very Bad Things\" was going to be an interesting ride when, at the first screening, people were laughing so hard. I've never heard people laugh that hard. Then, in the middle of it, this woman got up and kind of ran out of the theater and a guy was chasing after her. I walked out and there was this woman bent over a garbage can about to get sick. Her husband was standing next to her and I was kind of like, \"Is she OK?\" And the husband looked at me, \"No. She's not OK. Please stay back.\" Did they know that you were the director? No. But I can hear laughter coming from inside the theater and this woman is getting sick in a garbage can. And I was like, \"Gah. This is going to be a tricky one.\" Westwood. This was in Westwood. I know you were a producer on the \"Friday Night Lights\" television show and directed a couple of episodes. It doesn't happen very often that a television show overshadows the movie. Maybe \"overshadow\" isn't the right word. No, it overshadowed the movie. Is that weird for you? There are moments when I'll be with Garrett Hedlund or Lucas Black or Billy Bob Thornton -- and we'll talk about it and we're like, \"Hey, we did a movie, right?\" Like, \"We did do that movie!\" I mean, I don't feel bad about it. I always felt that one of the frustrating things about doing that movie was there was so much in Buzz Bissinger's book that made that movie work that we weren't able to fit into the movie. It talked a lot about racism, it talked a lot about academics and how we allocate money to schools and how much money goes to athletic programs versus academic programs -- religion and abortion and all of these themes were in the book. So, we felt like one of the reasons we did the show was I felt there was a lot more to discuss. So, I kind of look at it all as one big experience. You know, the football [action] in the movie was better than anything we were ever able to do on the TV show, but that's sort of what we were focused on. So, I'm happy. I'm happy that the whole \"Friday Night Lights\" experience has landed like it has.\n",

            "Paragraph: A new report found that 78 percent of surveyed countries face overwhelming obstacles in reducing deaths in children. But Malawi’s notable progress proves impoverished countries are capable of keeping more kids alive. Save the Children’s \"Lottery of Birth\" report, released on Wednesday, assessed 87 low- and middle-income countries’ child and maternal mortality rates. While many of the findings were deterring, the study noted that a number of underserved countries, including Malawi, have made significant strides in these health areas with replicable programs. Since 1990, the African country has reduced its child mortality rates by 72 percent. Two years ago, there were 68 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 244 in 1990. While Malawi is still far off from obtaining equitable health outcomes among the rich and the poor, it has outpaced other sub-Saharan African countries by committing more government funds to healthcare, prioritizing maternal care and bringing medical resources to rural areas. For example, Malawi is one of just six countries in the African Union (AU) that has met and surpassed its health-spending target, according to UNAIDS. In 2001, the AU pledged to spend at least 15 percent of total government budget on health. Malawi has committed 18 percent to such spending. Rwanda, which is on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals for child mortality and maternal health, has also surpassed the AU health pledge, according to the Save the Children report. Part of the reason why poor Malawian mothers and their newborns have a better shot at survival than those in nearby regions is because of the increased focus on maternal wellbeing. In the poorest areas of the country, 63 percent of births take place with a skilled attendant present. While advocates have pressed the need to improve that figure, it’s still far better than what many neighboring countries face. In Niger, which has one of the highest child mortality rates, just 8 percent of women in rural areas deliver with an adept birth attendant, according to Women and Health Alliance International. To ensure that kids in Malawi, even ones in the most remote regions, get access to basic medical care, the country’s Ministry of Health supported a program that brings treatment to children who were once inaccessible. Since 2008, more than 3,000 community health workers have delivered medicine and other equipment needed to treat malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and other non-fatal illnesses, to more than 10,400 communities. Despite its successes, Malawi is still plagued with a number of obstacles, which have impeded its progress. A government finance scandal led donors to withdraw their support in 2013. It also struggles with issues, which other countries that have had similar gains also face. Malawi, Bangladesh and Rwanda -- which were all heralded in the report for their child and maternal health progress -- still severely lack quality health services and well-trained health workers. Advocates say resolving that issue is key to curbing preventable deaths. \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that so many children’s chances of survival across the world are purely a matter of whether or not they were lucky enough to be born into an affluent family who can access quality healthcare,\" Carolyn Miles, president and CEO of Save the Children, said in a statement. \"We know that change is possible. We now have a significant window of opportunity to drive this change.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Many people suffer declining eyesight as they get older, but is there something we can eat to improve it, asks Michael Mosley. My eyesight has never been good. I've worn glasses most of my life and as I get older that's a situation that I've only expected to get worse. When the Trust Me, I'm A Doctor team suggested that I try taking supplements to improve my eyesight, though, I was sceptical, particularly as I am not a fan of supplements. Nonetheless I headed off to meet Prof John Barbur of City University in London to have my eyesight thoroughly tested. He was particularly interested in my retina, the light sensitive part of the eye, and made me stare at a computer screen in the dark for hours, having tests flashed up at me which thoroughly and precisely measured the limitations of my perception of different colours, my night vision and my detection of faint and small objects. He also measured the level of protection that the most delicate area of my retina - the macula - had against damage from high energy blue and UV light. This protection is, in effect, a kind of natural sunscreen that we have covering the light-detecting cells, and is made up of yellowish \"macular pigments\". The results of my tests were both fascinating and depressing. My detection of yellow and blue colours was extremely poor - something that Prof Barbur said was likely the result of my brush with diabetes many years ago. My night vision and perception of details were also poor compared with younger people - but consistent with my age. The Trust Me team then handed me a 90-day supply of supplement pills that were supposed to help. They contained concentrations of certain compounds found in coloured plants. These were extracted from marigolds, but two of the key chemicals - lutein and zeaxanthin - are also found in a range of things we eat more commonly. Find out more Michael Mosley (left, above) presents Trust Me, I'm A Doctor which is on Thursday 8 September on BBC Two at 20:00 BST - catch up on BBC iPlayer A team in the United States devised a recipe for a daily smoothie for us that they hoped could supply a similar level of lutein and zeaxanthin. It was a heady mix of fruits and veg such as kale and kiwi fruit, along with fats such as milk and wheat germ oil which help the absorption of the key compounds. Twelve weeks later, I returned to City University to see whether my daily pill-popping had made any difference to my eyesight. The results surprised even Prof Barbur. There were significant improvements in several different aspects - my blue and yellow colour perception was back to normal and my night vision was much better. The levels of my protective macular pigments were also boosted. The results were less of a surprise to Prof John Nolan, who I went to meet in Waterford, in south-east Ireland. His team has been studying macular pigments for many years, and recently completed a year-long trial with over 100 participants in which they had seen similar results to mine. They found that boosting the diet with the three macular pigments - lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin - led to significant improvements in the protection of the delicate macula, as well as improved eyesight. There is also some evidence that such supplementation may help slow or possibly even prevent, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the leading cause of vision loss in the UK. However, this is still controversial. Should we all, then, be taking supplements to protect and even improve our eyesight? Image copyright Reuters Image caption It's a good idea to eat kale Well, the research certainly shows that supplements work. Even for someone like me, who has a relatively healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, and whose blood levels of the compounds that weren't particularly low, the supplements helped. However, some researchers believe that diet can simply be enough, if we eat the right things. More research needs to be done on the best dietary sources for each of the three macular pigments. Lutein is a yellow compound made only by plants. They make it in order to absorb blue light, as part of their mechanism to capture energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Animals then get it from eating plants - good sources are green kale and spinach, or the yellow yolks of eggs. It is used as a supplement to feed industrially-reared chickens to make their yolks a more attractive yellow (and, being fat-soluble, ends up turning their skin and fat yellow too). Zeaxanthin is another yellow compound, almost identical to lutein, made by plants to absorb light. It is the chemical that gives corn, bell peppers and saffron their yellow colour. Meso-zeaxanthin is a form of zeaxanthin not generally found in plants, but it is made in the body from lutein. More research needs to be done on how efficient this process is. It is found in some fish (particularly in the skins), but in supplements containing marigold extract, it appears that the industrial processing that the marigolds undergo can create meso-zeaxanthin (and it has been found to be in some marigold-extract supplements, even when not listed on the label). Our volunteers taking the smoothie containing amounts of plant sources calculated to give them a boost of lutein and zeaxanthin did indeed boost their lutein levels, but not their zeaxanthin. Clearly more work needs to be done to refine the recipe. So, this might be a rare occasion where, given the current state of research, I might end up on the side of supplements - especially for those who don't eat as many leafy greens as they should, and for older people (who absorb nutrients less efficiently). However, for all of those whose mothers and grandmothers told them that carrots would improve their vision the message is this - although lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin are all chemicals known as \"carotenoids\", and carrots do owe the yellow portion of their colour to them, these particular key compounds are found mainly in the green parts of plants above ground. So, if you want to improve your eyesight, I'm afraid it's munching on leafy greens (taken with some fats to help absorb these fat-soluble chemicals) that will do the best job.

The former welterweight champion, who semi retired in controversial fashion back in Nov. 2013 after going six years undefeated, is currently in the throws of a full fight camp, according to La Presse. The Canadian newspaper reported quotes that were given to Globe MMA by Georges’ best friend and former cornerman Kristof Midoux, who verified that GSP is in camp right now. \"I will bring in sparring partners who will show him no deference,\" Midoux said. \"The best of the best, people who don’t know him.\" After defeating Conor McGregor at UFC 196 Nate Diaz went on retired fighter Chael Sonnen’s podcast to put forward his theory that GSP was in attendance at at the event to challenge McGregor in the event that the featherweight champ won. \"Yeah I heard (they were planning on having Conor call out GSP) but I put a big old hole in that shit. What did they think, that I’m some game they can play? I can’t be fucked with, I been in the game too long. They wanted to have this big old GSP vs. McGregor bullshit, with Georges sat in the front row at UFC 196, I don’t even wanna hear about that shit. Get the fuck outta here with that. What the fuck?

He would have held him down, that’s a freak show fight man.\" However, Midoux put the McGregor or Diaz rumors to bed and laid out the list of fighters GSP would like to face in the event of a comeback. \"Of course he’s interested in avenging his performance versus Hendricks,\" Midoux said. \"He and I both know he did not lose that fight, but he did not exactly win it either. With that said, he’s more interested in Lawler since he holds the title and beat Hendricks.\" Bring it on!\n",

I have too much free time,\" she joked. And free time she does indeed have. Lillakas, who vlogs under the name Jeely, originally spent five hours applying 100 coats of mascara in this video, and was inspired to put 100 layers of foundation to the test after her mascara post's success. Since then, her foundation video has racked up over 201,000 views. TBH, it's fascinating to watch all this go down. You literally get to see her take her foundation application from 0 to 💯, and then watch her set her face with a blow-dryer (because 100 layers just don't dry on their own). Here's how the process goes down: She starts with a bare, foundation-free face. First layer: Twenty layers in: \"Well, at least it's full coverage,\" she jokes. Forty layers in: \"You don't really need to blend the foundation with your neck,\" she suggests. \"Ain't nobody got time for that.\" Cakey foundation hack: Use a blow-dryer to set your foundation. Sixty layers in: \"This kinda looks like a highlighter. It's greasy AF,\" she says. Eighty layers in: One hundred layers later! \"I look flawless, huh?\" Um, that's a lot of freaking foundation! And while it was entertaining to see it all being applied, I don't recommend layering on 100 coats of foundation to your skin — and neither would your dermatologist. Especially since the result is a cakey, super-unnatural look. That said, I have to say, I'm looking forward to the next layering video Jeely does because I'm sure it'll be *~mEsMeRiZiNg~* and captivate us all.

            "Paragraph: Two students from the University of Hawaii at Hilo are suing the school, claiming their constitutional rights were violated when they were barred from handing out copies of the United States Constitution. In a federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Merritt Burch and Anthony Vizzone claim their First Amendment right to free speech was infringed upon during a January event where school officials stopped them as they passed out copies of the Constitution, according to Fox News. Burch and Vizzone, who were there to represent the campus’ chapter of Young Americans for Liberty, were told that campus policy dictates members of clubs and organizations are not allowed to approach fellow students and solicit them. The complaint also states that the university \"unconstitutionally restricts access to open areas on campus by requiring students to seek permission to speak at least seven business days in advance.\" Without getting prior permission, students who wish to exercise their freedom are relegated to a small \"free speech zone\" on the edge of campus, which the students’ lawyers say is not particularly accessible or in a high-traffic area. Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is assisting in the lawsuit, went so far as to call the undesirable zone a \"censorship swamp.\" \"The First Amendment is not optional at public colleges -- it’s the law,\" Lukianoff said in a statement. \"Enforcing restrictive ‘free speech zone’ policies that prevent students from passing out copies of the Constitution is impossible to justify.\" According to the plaintiffs’ attorney, Bob Corn-Revere, \"Part of the paradox is the idea that on a state campus, the exercise of constitutional rights can be confined to a zone, to one-quarter of 1 percent of the campus.\" The University of Hawaii issued a statement saying it has begun \"a review of the policies involved and the manner in which they were enforced.\" It also noted the university \"is committed to free expression and the open exchange of ideas.\" Despite the lawsuit, the chapter of Young Americans for Liberty doesn't appear to be hampered by the campus policies. Burch, who is the chapter’s president, published a blog post on the Young Americans for Liberty website the same day the lawsuit was filed, boasting the success of an April 17 event on U.S. national debt. The post specifically points out how the event raised the organization’s profile to students on campus and the surrounding community. \"We attracted the attention of hundreds of students and managed to get almost 40 new signups for our club,\" wrote Burch. She added their event also made the local newspaper’s front page. Burch and Vizzone's lawsuit repeats a similar situation at another American campus. In February, the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, which is also representing the Hawaii students, helped a California college student win a $50,000 settlement after he was stopped from handing out copies of the Constitution.

That touched off a cascade of revelations that, for the first time, has allowed the Bangladeshi authorities to penetrate the murky world of the attackers and answer questions about the planning, execution and purpose of the attacks that have baffled the country — and, indeed, the world — since the violence began. Key Facts At least 39 people have been killed in attacks with machetes, guns and bombs since February 2013. The killings, mostly with machete blows to the back of the victim’s neck, have been accelerating lately, with five people murdered in April, four in May and at least three so far in June. On Sunday, a Christian grocer and the wife of a police superintendent who had been cracking down on militant attacks were killed in separate strikes. On Tuesday, a Hindu priest was killed in southwestern Bangladesh. In a lengthy interview, the chief of the police counterterrorism unit, Monirul Islam, who assumed his post in February, laid out the findings of his investigation in minute detail. The killings were organized by two militant Islamic groups that have gathered volunteers and recruits, trained them and eventually seeded them into cells run by a commander, Mr. Islam said. They have tried to pick their targets with care, with the aim of gaining support from the public, he said, and trained teams of killers. Their goal was to convert Bangladesh’s mixed secular and religious culture to an Islamist one, the chief investigator said. The Bangladeshi authorities say that they now believe they have identified the top leadership of the two groups they say are responsible, and that they are preparing to round them up. Only when the leaders are caught, they caution, will the attacks be stopped, and at that, only for a while if the appeal of Islamic fundamentalism is not blunted. Secular Versus Islamists Bangladesh, a nation with a Muslim majority adjoining eastern India, gained independence from Pakistan in a vicious war in 1971 and established a secular, democratic government. A military coup in 1975 led to more than three decades of mostly military-backed governments sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalists, until a secular government returned to power in 2009 with an overwhelming majority. But secularism is far from universally accepted in Bangladesh, and has always had to contend with a conservative Islamic culture. To a surprising extent, the militants have succeeded in their aim of discrediting secularism, the chief investigator said. \"In general, people think they have done the right thing, that it’s not unjustifiable to kill\" the bloggers, gay people and other secularists, he added. They have also put the secular government on the defensive. As a result, even as the government has condemned the killings, it has urged writers not to criticize Islam and warned that advocating \"unnatural sex\" is a criminal offense. Some experts say that only a more widespread crackdown will stop the killings, but that the government has held back, fearful of creating a backlash. \"The politics has been turned into the secular versus the Islamists,\" said Abdur Rashid, a retired army major general and executive director of the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies in Dhaka. \"Therefore the government is cautious.\" While the killers’ strikes often appear random, Mr. Islam says the terrorism campaign was conceived by the militant groups quite deliberately as a response to mass protests in early 2013, known collectively as the Shahbag movement. Inspired by a group of bloggers who led the protests, the demonstrators advocated an end to religion-based politics and the prosecution of war crimes dating to the 1971 war for independence. War crimes prosecutions have been a particular source of anger for Islamists. They were shelved during the period of military-backed rule but revived under the new democratic government in 2009. Four of the five convicted and executed in the latest round of trials were leaders in the country’s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, outraging Muslim fundamentalists and others. Two groups in particular took up the fight against secularism, Mr. Islam said. One, Ansar al-Islam, is led by a fiery cleric and a charismatic, well-trained operational commander, both of whom Mr. Islam declined to identify because they are being watched. Its leaders command about 25 trained killers, some of whom have been involved in three or four attacks, Mr. Islam said. The second, the Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, is the reorganized offshoot of a group banned in 2005 for setting off nearly 500 bombs simultaneously around the country. While both are radical Islamist groups, Mr. Islam said, neither seems to have direct links to larger terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, though those groups have occasionally claimed credit for the attacks. ‘It Is Your Duty to Kill’ The Islamist groups appear to have reacted quickly to the Shahbag movement, mounting their first fatal attack on Feb. 15, 2013, against a blogger who wrote critically of Islam under the pseudonym Thaba Baba. It was carried out by a group of students from North South University in Dhaka, who were incited by the sermons of the spiritual leader of Ansar al-Islam at the time, a 45-year-old cleric named Jasim Uddin Rahmani. The students used to attend his Friday speeches at a local mosque where Mr. Rahmani, who has since been arrested, declared a fatwa on bloggers critical of Islam, calling for them to be killed, Mr. Islam said. As it happened, one of the students, a 32-year-old senior named Redwanul Azad Rana, was also a leader in Ansar al-Islam, Mr. Islam said. He invited the younger students to Mr. Rahmani’s sermons and introduced them to the writings of Thaba Baba. \"Being a believer, it is your duty to kill\" Thaba Baba, Mr. Rana told the students, one of them said in his confession in court. Prodded by Mr. Rana, \"we made a plan to kill Islam’s and Prophet Muhammad’s insulter Thaba Baba by identifying him,\" the student, Faisal Bin Nayeem, 24, said in the statement. He said they found Thaba Baba’s picture on Facebook, then searched for someone matching it at the Shahbag protest, still underway at the time. Eventually, they identified a 32-year-old architect, Ahmed Rajib Haider, as Thaba Baba. After studying Mr. Haider’s routines, three of them surprised him outside his house around 9 p.m. Mr. Nayeem said he drove his machete into the back of Mr. Haider’s neck and hit him twice more as he fell forward. Ansar al-Islam, with the help of mainstream Islamist groups, then began to publicize Mr. Haider’s writings, casting the killers as defenders of Islam against \"atheist bloggers.\" The writings, published in at least two national dailies, enraged large segments of the population, who had previously been sympathetic to the Shahbag movement, Mr. Islam said. During the next two months, two more bloggers were killed. The police began arresting the North South University students who were involved in killing Mr. Haider, and also caught Mr. Rahmani, the cleric who inspired them. But Mr. Rana, the student leader, remains at large and is thought to have left the country. Mr. Islam said he believes these arrests stopped Ansar al-Islam — also known as the Ansarullah Bangla Team — from killing more people in 2013 and 2014. But the group reorganized the terrorist cells, he said, and the killing resumed. In February of last year, Mr. Islam said, Ansar attackers killed Avijit Roy, 42, an American citizen of Bangladeshi origin. Mr. Roy worked by day in the biotechnology industry in the United States and by night as a writer of books on science, homosexuality and religion, in addition to founding a website called Mukto-Mona, Bengali for freethinker. From the growing number of attackers in detention, the police learned that the newly reconstituted Ansar al-Islam had changed its tactics, now recruiting madrasa students and teachers instead of university students to carry out killings. Mr. Islam said a violent protest by the madrasa students in May 2013 convinced Ansar al-Islam leaders that they were a more promising source of fanatical recruits than their university counterparts. The training and indoctrination of the recruits became more rigorous and systematic at that time, Mr. Islam said. The cell that assassinated another blogger, Oyasiqur Rahman Babu, 27, just a month after Mr. Roy’s killing rented an apartment where two senior operatives worked with the group of would-be killers. One, an operations expert, taught them how to kill with a machete and use a pistol to scatter anyone interrupting the attack. Armed with Mr. Babu’s picture and his address, the assassins were sent to his home to assess the situation and returned to a barrage of questions from the trainer. \"What happens if you are stopped? What will you do?\" he asked them, Mr. Islam said. Close to the planned date of the attack, the other operative, an ideologist, introduced the killers to Mr. Babu’s writings. The students were given samples calculated to stir them up. \"What is the punishment for someone who writes these insults?\" the trainer asked them. The group answered in unison, day after day, \"Only death,\" the arrested students told investigators. Mr. Islam said the hardest part for the police was identifying the leaders, who were so concerned about security that they would not give their real names to the madrasa students they were training. Still, the police have now identified a trainer involved in planning the attack on Mr. Babu. Last month they printed the suspect’s picture, along with those of five others accused of participating in the killings, in local dailies, offering rewards of up to 500,000 takas, about $6,400, for information leading to their arrests. Costly Slip-Ups The other militant group, the reorganized Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, works independently of Ansar al-Islam and almost exclusively in northern Bangladesh, the chief investigator said. But the group is less professional than Ansar al-Islam, he said, making mistakes that are costing it public support. The group has trained 50 to 100 madrasa students as killers, he said, organizing them into cells of four or five. But through shoddy research, many of the victims have turned out to be popular local figures. Among them: a homeopathic doctor who used to give free treatment to villagers, and an English professor at Rajshahi University who was not known to have written critically of Islam. When detained militants learned that a 66-year-old Japanese man they had slaughtered had converted to Islam in 2015, they told investigators they were upset over their mistake. With all the slip-ups, the communities turned against them. With the public’s support, Mr. Islam said, the police quickly rounded up the suspected hit men and several of their handlers in most of the Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh killings, and were in pursuit of the senior leadership. Many in Bangladesh continue to live in terror. Twenty-five associates of one victim, a gay rights activist, have taken refuge in safe houses provided by diplomatic missions. Several dozen bloggers have fled the country. Those who remain have grown fatalistic. \"On this journey, we’ll lose our lives,\" Arif Jebtik, 39, one of the leaders of the Shahbag movement, said in an interview in his Dhaka apartment, which he rarely leaves. He has quit his job, closed his blog and stopped dropping his children off at school. \"This is the price we have to pay to history,\" he said.\n",

            "Paragraph: A strange trail in remote area of the Himalayas could come from the mysterious Yeti, according to hiker Steve Berry who spotted the footprint-like tracks on Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan. Rather than the footprints belong to the legendary Yeti, experts believe the tracks could belong to a goat, however, a yak herder told Mr. Berry he had seen the yeti about 11 years earlier. The creature covered in long dun brown-colored hair was about 100 yards from me, before it disappeared. Furthermore the Yeti put one foot directly in front of the other and these tracks are similar to the tracks of the Yeti I have seen, the Yak herder said to Mr. Berry. Another interesting detail, the area of the supposed footprints of the Yeti is located in the same region of the Himalayas (see above image) where Google Earth has blacked out a large part of a mountain peak and where locals witnesses strange apparitions and suspicious objects.\n",

            "Paragraph: The Internet's favorite sketch comedy duo is getting a shot at its very own TV show. Comedy Central is adding to its already impressive list of original shows by giving BriTANick, the online sketch duo made up of Brian McElhaney and Nick Kocher, a half-hour scripted pilot. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show -- which will also be called \"BriTaNick\" -- will see McElhaney and Kocher playing exaggerated versions of themselves and feature stories based on their real lives. \"BriTANick\" will join a slew of other of the network's popular comedies, such as \"Broad City,\" \"Inside Amy Schumer,\" \"Workaholics,\" \"Key and Peele,\" \"The Kroll Show\" and \"South Park.\" For those who may still be wondering why McElhaney and Kocher deserve to have a show alongside these comedies, here's our version of proof: When they hit it, they hit it big. The two gained recognition and popularity when their video \"Academy Award Winning Movie Trailer\" went viral and was nominated for \"Viral Video of the Year\" at the Comedy Awards in 2011. No one else has ideas like theirs. With their heightened popularity, they then turned some heads by getting actor Danny Pudi (\"Community\") to help with a follow up to their bizarrely hysterical video \"A Monologue For Thee.\" The video below is \"A Monologue for Three.\" (Get it?) They have friends in high places. They tickled the funny bone of Joss Whedon, who couldn't help but sing their praises online. He even agreed to star in this video as a pee coach on parole. (You did not read that incorrectly.) He even cast them to play the Watchmen in his adaptation of Shakespeare’s \"Much Ado About Nothing.\" While filming, they missed no opportunity to create great content. They bring their own charm to any role. Although they were only around for one episode, they’ll forever be the two guys to whom Barney Stinson passed the Bro torch during the final season of \"How I Met Your Mother.\" Oh, and they're basically movie stars. During all this excitement, they’ve even found time to make or star in a handful of short movies, including \"SuckerPunch,\" \"Searching for Sonny\" and the outrageous \"Eagles Are Turning People Into Horses,\" which, by the way, almost got McElhaney thrown out of a film class in college and became an official selection of the 2010 SlamDance and SXSW film festivals. So hopefully you’ll join us in being utterly thrilled to see what these two can do with their very own show.\n",

            "Paragraph: In the first half of 2016, police have killed 532 people — many of whom were unarmed, mentally ill, and people of color. Going by the Going by the Guardian’s count , 261 white people were killed by police — the highest total out of any racial group. But data also shows that black people and Native Americans are being killed at higher rates than any other group. The slight discrepancies in numbers between Killed by Police and The Guardian reflect differences in how each outlet collects data about police killings. Killed by Police is mainly open-sourced and also relies on The slight discrepancies in numbers between Killed by Police and The Guardian reflect differences in how each outlet collects data about police killings. Killed by Police is mainly open-sourced and also relies on corporate news reports for its data on people killed by police. For its database, The Guardian relies on traditional reporting on police reports and witness statements, while also culling data from verified crowdsourced information using regional news outlets, research groups, and reporting projects that include Killed by Police. There has always been a high volume of police killings, although damning videos, photos, and news reports highlight officer violence — especially against people of color — now more than ever. But what’s become an even more alarming trend is the number of officers involved in these killings who receive minor to no punishment. According to the According to the Wall Street Journal , 2015 saw the highest number of police officers being charged for deadly, on-duty shootings in a decade: 12 as of September 2015. Still, in a year when approximately 1,200 people were killed by police, zero officers were convicted of murder or manslaughter, painting the picture that officers involved in killing another person will not be held accountable for their actions. In 2016, several officers have gone to trial but none of them received jail time. Here are some of the most egregious examples of cops who haven’t been penalized for killing: William Porter, Edward Nero, and Caesar Goodwin — Baltimore, Maryland Freddie Gray was apprehended by police during a bike patrol on April 12, 2015, when a violent arrest left him unable to walk on his own. On the way to booking, no officer put a seat belt on Gray, causing him to be thrown around the van with no help received from any of the officers. In total, there were six officers involved in his death, and three have been tried so far. But during those three trials, which spanned from December 2015 to June, none of the officers were convicted. The trial of The trial of Officer William Porter ended in a hung jury in December, amounting to no action being taken against Porter unless a second trial scheduled for later this year finds him guilty. In May, Officer Edward Nero was declared not guilty of all criminal charges against him — second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, and misconduct in office. Nero was one of the first officers to encounter Gray during his arrest and helped load Gray into the police van, where he was not secured with a seat belt. On June 23, the latest trial in Gray’s case found On June 23, the latest trial in Gray’s case found Officer Caesar Goodwin not guilty of second-degree depraved heart murder, reckless endangerment, second-degree assault, and manslaughter. Goodwin drove the police van where Gray suffered the spine injury that ultimately led to his death, didn’t secure the 25-year-old’s seat belt, and waited to call a medic when Gray was in distress. Goodson faced the most serious charges of the six officers. Peter Liang — New York City In April, two months after a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, former In April, two months after a jury convicted him of manslaughter and official misconduct, former NYPD Oficer Officer Peter Liang was sentenced to five years probation and 800 hours of community service. Liang is responsible for fatally shooting 28-year-old Brooklyn resident Akai Gurley last November, in the dark stairwell of a public housing building. While Liang was in the building, the rookie cop claimed he accidentally fired his gun and the bullet ricocheted off the wall before striking Gurley in the heart. Gurley was innocent of any wrongdoing and unarmed when he was killed. During the trial, Liang claimed the shooting was accidental, but was convicted of manslaughter in February. The former officer was also convicted of official misconduct for failing to provide any sort of medical assistance to Gurley as he lay bleeding on the staircase. Following his conviction, Liang was fired from the NYPD. Just before his sentence was handed down, the manslaughter charge was reduced to criminally negligent homicide. And despite being convicted of manslaughter, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson announced in March that jail time for Liang should be taken off the table. He recommended six months of house arrest, five years of probation, and 500 hours of community service, instead. Liang was the first NYPD officer convicted of an on-duty shooting in the past decade. Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze — Minneapolis, Minnesota In March, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old In March, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark will not be facing any criminal charges for their actions. Clark, who was unarmed, died from a gunshot to the head when Schwarz fired his gun 61 seconds after arriving on the scene. According to the county attorney, Clark was resisting arrest and attempted to grab Ringgenberg’s gun. Despite this claim, several witness say that Clark was already handcuffed. Although placed on administrative leave following the shooting, both officers returned to desk duty in January. Two weeks prior to the decision, Freeman Two weeks prior to the decision, Freeman announced that Hennepin County, including Minneapolis, will no longer use grand juries to determine whether cops involved in fatal shootings should be indicted. \"I concluded that the accountability and transparency limitations of a grand jury are too high a hurdle to overcome,\" he said. Beginning with Clark’s case, Freeman’s office would decide to indict in the future. The policy shift was made in response to pressure from Black Lives Matter activists who protested against grand jury proceedings in the Clark case. Celisa Calacal is an intern with ThinkProgress.\n",

            "Paragraph: Researchers said the signs of a cognitive slow-down were not a pre-cursor to a decline in other areas of a woman's health A new study has suggested women start losing their memory and the ability to think as quickly in their fifties, an age range earlier than previously thought.  Researchers from UCLA and Brandeis university studied over 2,000 women in their forties for 10 years after menopause and found their cognitive speed declined by five per cent over the ten year period. Their verbal episodic memory also declined by two per cent in the ten years. The women were measured every one to two years for an average of six and a half years.  \"Our results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive ageing in midlife women, with substantial with-woman declines in processing speed and memory,\" they wrote in the study published in PLOS ONE. The study found there was \"cognitive ageing in women in midlife, with significant longitudinal declines in both processing speed and verbal memory\".  The authors noted that previous studies have not consistently measured cognitive performance in those under 60 and said that following their results further research is needed to identify factors which could influence the decline rates and to develop interventions which could slow cognitive ageing. They also said that while these changes happened around the time of menopause, they did not think the cognitive slow-down was due to these hormonal changes as they \"did not see a sharp acceleration of cognitive decline during or after the menopause transition\". Researchers also said the signs of cognitive ageing were not a pre-cursor of a decline in other areas of a woman’s general health and wellbeing.  Men were not surveyed during the study but previous studies have suggested men over 40 have worse memories than women of the same age and that women are generally better at remembering conversations than men.\n",

Ismaïl's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismaïl was infamously ruthless — his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle. Any suspicion of adultery against Ismaïl was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismaïl fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismaïl was 57 and had ruled for 32 years. Some researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismaïl could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismaïl had said. To solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismaïl had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record. \"We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,\" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science. The simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. Other factors included how good Ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles. The simulations suggest Ismaïl needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring — the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women. Although the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that Ismaïl could have actually had all these children, \"the results from them were all quite different from each other,\" Oberzaucher said. \"This really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction — you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women.\" Oberzaucher and her colleague Karl Grammer detailed their findings Feb. 14 in the journal PLOS ONE.\n",

            "Topic: 'Meet The Press' Shows Us Exactly How Not To Cover Climate Change\n",
            "Paragraph: On Friday, \"Meet the Press\" host David Gregory sent out this tweet: Plus - only on #MTP: Debating Climate change w/ Bill Nye @TheScienceGuy and Vice Chair of Energy & Commerce Cmte @MarshaBlackburn — David Gregory (@davidgregory) February 14, 2014 This, to put it mildly, is not the way to do things. First, some context: TV news shows almost never cover climate change, which ought to be one of the most aggressively-reported issues around, given that, y'know, it's a dire threat to the planet and everyone on it. A recent study from Media Matters found that the Sunday shows on NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox spent a combined 27 minutes on the topic in the whole of 2013. Meet the Press was singled out as \"failing to offer a single substantial mention of climate change\" for the entire year. So, when \"MTP\" does finally decide that the issue merits its consideration, what does it do? It sets up a \"debate\" about the issue between Bill Nye—who, despite the great things he has done to popularize science, is not a climate scientist—and Blackburn, who has previously tweeted about how proud she is to deny that global warming exists. The existence of climate change is no longer an issue up for discussion, and hasn't been for decades. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said there was a 95 percent chance that humans are responsible for global warming. The only debate left is what to do about climate change, not whether it exists. And, if the Sunday shows do insist on carrying out that tired conflict, they should at least put the debate in the hands of climate scientists, rather than media figures or politicians. \"Meet the Press\" is providing a perfect example of what not to do. The Sunday shows on ABC and CBS are doing marginally better this weekend. Both are covering \"extreme weather,\" which naturally involves a conversation about climate change, and, regrettably, both are seemingly keen on maintaining the idea that there is still a \"debate\" about the topic afoot. Consequently, both shows are featuring Republican governor Pat McCrory, who has previously said that global warming is \"in God's hands.\" But they're also turning to actual climate scientists. \"This Week\" is speaking to Climate Central's chief climatologist Dr. Heidi Cullen, and \"Face the Nation\" is turning to Dr. Marshall Shepherd, the former head of the American Meteorological Society. That's a small step, but it is something.\n",

            "Paragraph: The figures represent a 150 per cent increase on 2014 figures and a 15 per cent increase on 2015 More than a quarter of a million patients were forced to change their doctor’s surgery last year as the closure of GP practices hit record levels, data suggests. Some 265,000 patients had to change their practice, a 150 per cent increase on 2014 figures and a 15 per cent increase on 2015, according to data collected by Pulse magazine under the Freedom of Information Act. The figures, most of which were provided by NHS England, showed that 57 practices closed completely last year. A further 34 closed due to the merger of practices. Some areas were particularly hit, with Brighton seeing seven practices close in the past two years, Pulse said. Four of these closures meant 9,000 patients had to find a new surgery. Last year, NHS England announced a £500m \"turnaround package\" to help struggling surgeries, including those at risk of closure. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"GP practices are the lifeblood of our local communities so the complete closure of any practice will always be a last resort when all other options have proved unworkable. \"Unfortunately, too many practices are being forced to close because GPs and their teams can no longer cope with ever-growing patient demand without the necessary funding and workforce to deal with it.\" She said some practices choose to merge \"in order to pool their resources to provide additional services or better appointment access, which is in the best interests of patients\". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, told Pulse: \"We know the money, targeted in the right way, for the most severely affected practices, can make a difference. \"The tragedy is CCGs [Clinical Commissioning Groups] have not delivered their part in making the resource available. Many practices that should have received support have had none to date. That’s been a failing of local delivery.\" An NHS England spokesman said: \"All NHS patients wanting to register with a GP practice are guaranteed to be able to do so and we have increased investment in general practice by £1bn in two years in order to improve services and boost GP numbers. The spokesman said the figures \"as presented\" did not reflected the full picture as they included patients whose records automatically transferred after a merger. He said: \"As part of our plans to improve general practice services and boost the workforce, many practices are choosing to merge in order to offer patients a much greater range of services.\" Shadow Health Secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, commented: \"Given the crisis in hospitals we’ve seen, we need to be taking pressure off of hospitals. \"That means doing much more to protect GP services. With Labour, general practice will be at the heart of making the English NHS more focused on care closer to home. \"Tory ministers need to take urgent action to address this spike in GP practice closures and explain what they will do to make sure patients can easily and safely access the GP services they need.\"\n",

            "Topic: Indiana University used this one weird trick to cut student debt\n",
            "Paragraph: Students are graduating with more debt than ever before: about $33,000 for the average four-year college graduate with loans in the class of 2014. Indiana University, though, found a simple way to get students to borrow less: telling them how much they already owe when they're taking out loans for the next academic year. The university, where the average senior with loans graduated with nearly $29,000 in debt in 2012, began sending students letters each year telling them how much they'd already borrowed, what their interest rates were, and what their monthly payment would be after graduation. And in response, students seem to have borrowed less. It's too early to tell how much the behavior of individual borrowers changed, but in aggregate, students at IU took 11 percent less in federal loans during the 2013-'14 school year. Indiana is celebrating this as a success. The experiment indicates how little many students know about what their financial obligations will be after graduation. But it's not clear whether IU's solution gets at the root of the student debt problem: Are students really borrowing more than they need, or are there other factors driving high debt? Why student loan borrowers often don't know their monthly payment If you're taking out an auto loan or a mortgage, you already know what your monthly payment will be. If you're paying your credit card bill, there's a box on the statement telling you how long it will take to pay off the debt if you make only the monthly minimums. But student loans often don't come with such clear-cut information attached. That's because student debt doesn't accumulate all at once; it piles up in installments, year after year, often with different interest rates. And financial aid can be confusing. Students can borrow different types of federal loans, or combine federal loans with private loans from banks. All this can make it difficult to tell how much you'll owe and what your payments will be. Indiana tried to fix that with a one-page summary of what students owe so far, what kinds of loans they've taken out, and what their interest rate is. After the letters were sent, students started asking for more help to manage their student loan debt, James Kennedy, an associate vice president at IU, told a congressional committee in June. And the average debt for graduating seniors with loans dropped slightly between 2012 and 2013, from $28,769 to $27,619, even as average debts were increasing nationwide. Why are students borrowing so much? Some economists are concerned that student loan debt is making it harder for recent college graduates to buy houses and cars, as well as lessening the amount of money they have to spend and boost the economy. The Indiana University experience suggests that some students changed their behavior once they realized how much they were borrowing. But experts disagree about whether students who borrow more money than they really need is a widespread problem, or whether outside factors — like higher tuition prices — have made borrowing large amounts a true necessity. Some colleges argue that they don't have enough control over how much debt their students are taking on, and that this means some students are able to borrow more than they really need. Colleges can't change how much groups of students are allowed to borrow — so, for example, a student living at home can take on just as much debt as a student living in the dorms. The professional organization for college financial aid officials, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, recommends that colleges should be allowed to set lower loan limits for some students, such as students attending less than full time. Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate education committee, agreed, saying in May that some students borrow too much and that he's looking into legislation that would allow colleges to limit it. Some researchers aren't so sure this is necessary. \"It’s hard to convincingly argue that overborrowing for an undergraduate degree is truly an epidemic,\" wrote Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor of higher education at Seton Hall University who studies financial aid. If anything, he said, his research suggests that students aren't always borrowing enough. About one-third of colleges underestimate the cost of living for their students by more than $3,000, and students can't borrow more than colleges say they'll need. That can seem counterintuitive in a time of concern about students with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt. But the most important factor for being able to pay back student loans is graduating from college. And for some students, taking out more loans means they'll have to work fewer hours and have more time to devote to their studies. Indiana's letter, and students' response, suggests that at least some students feel they could be more mindful about their borrowing. But going too far to discourage students from taking on debt could have unintended consequences of its own.\n",

            "Paragraph: A day after LeBron James called him a \"hater\" and dug up some of his personal history, TNT analyst Charles Barkley says he stands by his criticism of the Cleveland Cavaliers' star player. \"I stick by what I said, I'm not going to make this personal. ... He was all whiny last week,\" Barkley said on the Waddle & Silvy show on ESPN Radio on Tuesday. \"... I'm good and I'm straightforward, I'm never going to get personal on an NBA player.\" Last week, Barkley said James was being \"whiny\" for publicly saying the Cavs need to bring in another playmaker. \"Inappropriate. Whiny. All of the above,\" Barkley said of James then. \"The Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted [Iman] Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver. He's [LeBron] the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending champs.\" James, clearly irked by Barkley's comments, told ESPN's Dave McMenamin on Monday night that he won't let Barkley \"disrespect my legacy like that,\" and took some personal shots at the Hall of Famer. \"I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas,\" James told ESPN on Monday. \"I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.\" When asked Tuesday whether he felt James crossed the line, Barkley said it was a case of shooting the messenger and that he had no issues with James' remarks. \"I was laughing, clearly he did some homework ... he Googled me and found some things,\" Barkley said. \"He was young when I was playing, so I appreciate that, but I'm not upset about it. ... My criticism was fair, and I'm good with that.\" Despite drawing the ire of one of the biggest names in the sport, Barkley said he doesn't plan to rein in his opinions. \"Some of the stuff he said about me is correct -- doesn't make the message I said about him incorrect,\" Barkley said. \"Some of them are intimidated about LeBron, [but] I'm not intimidated at all.\"\n",

But one surprising trend that has us reeling that's due to the recession is a surge in the super rich buying up castles at discounted prices. Yes, you read that right. Perhaps they're inspired by the popularity of Downton Abbey? According to The Wall Street Journal, these grand homes in Europe are being bought up by buyers from overseas. For example, the Dall Estate, a 200-acre property with 81 rooms in Scotland is now on the market for $9.344 million. Sounds like a lot, but it's actually a steal -- it also includes 45 other cottages, a shooting range, curling rink, nine-hole golf course and stables. And in most cases, these manses are meant to be a second home. \"A budget which would only probably buy you a flat in central London could buy you a castle in Scotland,\" Kyle Cockburn, an associate at Re/Max Scotland, told the WSJ.

In the last couple of months, several sources suggested that GTA VI has been facing numerous delays. This rumor that GTA VI will be a Project Scorpio exclusive is highly unlikely as Microsoft will have to pay millions for this highly popular game to be exclusive to its console only. On the other hand, the pool of players with a PlayStation console is larger than that of Xbox, which could easily make Rockstar think against the idea. Microsoft is currently focused more in developing first party games like Forza, Scalebound, etc. rather than the third party exclusive titles.

            "Paragraph: English grammar, beloved by sticklers, is also feared by non-native speakers. Many of its idiosyncrasies can turn into traps even for the most confident users. But some of the most binding rules in English are things that native speakers know but don’t know they know, even though they use them every day. When someone points one out, it’s like a magical little shock. This week, for example, the BBC’s Matthew Anderson pointed out a \"rule\" about the order in which adjectives have to be put in front of a noun. Judging by the number of retweets—over 47,000 at last count—this came as a complete surprise to many people who thought they knew all about English: Things native English speakers know, but don't know we know: pic.twitter.com/Ex0Ui9oBSL — Matthew Anderson (@MattAndersonBBC) September 3, 2016 That quote comes from a book called The Elements of Eloquence: How to Turn the Perfect English Phrase. Adjectives, writes the author, professional stickler Mark Forsyth, \"absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac.\" Mixing up the above phrase does, as Forsyth writes, feel inexplicably wrong (a rectangular silver French old little lovely whittling green knife...), though nobody can say why. It’s almost like secret knowledge we all share. Learn the language in a non-English-speaking country, however, and such \"secrets\" are taught in meticulous detail. Here’s a page from a book, published by Cambridge University Press, used regularly to teach English to non-native speakers. An English teacher in Hungary sent it to us. From English Grammar in Use—a self study reference and practise book for intermediate students by Raymond Murphy, published by Cambridge University Press in 1994. (Cambridge University Press) The book lays out the adjective order in the same way as Forsyth’s surprising illumination. Hungarian students, and no doubt those in many other countries, slave over the rule, committing it to memory and thinking through the order when called upon to describe something using more than one adjective. The fact is, a lot of English grammar rules only come as a surprise to those who know them most intimately. Learning rules doesn’t always work, however. Forsyth also takes issue with the rules we think we know, but which don’t actually hold true. In a lecture about grammar, he dismantles the commonly held English spelling mantra \"I before E except after C.\" It’s used to help people remember how to spell words like \"piece,\" but, Forsyth says, there are only 44 words that follow the rule, and 923 that don’t. His prime examples? \"Their,\" \"being,\" and \"eight.\"\n",

Water bombers assisted fire crews on the ground in the effort to protect homes from the blaze that burnt through more than 200 hectares of bushland. Authorities are yet to begin an investigation in the cause of the fire, which has now been downgraded from an emergency warning to a watch and act. Fire Services Superintendent Peter Norman said fire crews were still working to ensure it was safe for residents to return to their properties. \"Firefighters are mopping up, making the area safe and strengthening containment lines overnight and as the sun comes up and the day unearths tomorrow we'll check for trees and power lines and other safety hazards that may stop them returning to their homes,\" Mr Norman said. Fiona Butterly from Down South Boarding Kennels in nearby Argyle said on Thursday she had a plan to leave, had she been advised to do so. \"[We can] definitely see smoke [but] no flames,\" she said. \"[We] can't smell smoke or anything at the moment, it's blowing in the other direction and there's no ash or anything like that.\" Ms Butterly said they had contingency plans in place with other kennels and the local vet if they were asked to leave the area. About 30 firefighters were sent to the area, and water bombers sent in to assist those on the ground. A massive plume of smoke could be seen from Bunbury, about 30 kilometres away. A temporary evacuation centre was established at Donnybrook Recreation Centre on Steer Street in Donnybrook. Temperatures soared in Western Australia on Thursday, with nearby Donnybrook hitting 37 degrees Celsius. The temperature passed 41C in Perth.\n",

And now that the weather's getting colder, there's probably a good chance that you might curl up under the covers with a flick and a snack of some sort. But just how unsanitary is eating in your bed? We wanted to know, and we wanted you to know, too. Kadi Dulude, the owner of top New York City cleaning service Wizard Of Homes, told HuffPost Home that \"at least half\" of the places she cleans show signs of people eating in their beds. \"Most people know to take their dishes to the sink, but in the extreme cases, it's like their bed is their dining room and if they don't clean up, there are a lot of bugs,\" says Dulude. So what will happen when you leave traces of snacking between the sheets? Paul Bello, exterminator and owner of PJB Pest Management Consulting, told HuffPost Home that bugs will appear when there are crumbs left around. The most common creepy crawlers to show up? Ants and cockroaches. \"The people who are sloppy and don't clean up after themselves are the ones who run the risk,\" says Bello. \"Cockroaches need only a little bit of food to survive.\" As you might expect, certain foods attract different types of bugs. According to Lou Sorkin, a forensic entomologist (a person who studies insects) and a senior scientific assistant at the American Museum of Natural History, sweet foods such as soda, fruit juices, cupcakes and cookies with icing could attract ants and certain flies, including house flies, blue bottle flies and green bottle flies. Leftover foods, such as milk from a bowl of cereal, pizza sitting in the box or hamburgers and chicken left out in the takeout container, can attract ants, flies and even cockroaches. Normally, Dulude advises that people wash their sheets every week, but for those who constantly eat in bed, she says every three days would be ideal. When it's all said and done, we suggest heeding Dulude's sage advice when it comes to bedroom practices. \"I would suggest not eating in bed at all,\" she said. \"Just don't put the TV in the bedroom. Keep the bedroom as a sacred place where you go to rest.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Ferrari’s current hypercar offering, the LaFerrari, is about as awesome as a car can get. The car is powered by a V12 engine and electric motors which together produce 950 bhp. And it’s as exclusive as cars come – only 500 coupe models were ever made and 209 convertibles will be made.

His LaFerrari is destined to be turned into scrap metal by a car crusher. Here’s why. According to Fin24, about three years ago, he tried to bring the car to his home country, but couldn’t muster the taxes and duties the govt. imposes. The car was therefore left to languish in a warehouse. Then in February this year, the owner submitted an export declaration to take the car to Congo. But a day after leaving South Africa, the car was allegedly smuggled back into the country from the same border post. As luck would have it, they were caught. Now, the car has been impounded again and if the owner is not able to justify the car’s import back into the country, the car will be crushed into a cube.\n",

            "Paragraph: CEO Evan Spiegel is the public face of Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., but Bobby Murphy also wields considerable power as its cofounder and chief technology officer. Together, Murphy and Spiegel own the vast majority of Snap's voting stock, giving them complete control over the company's future. Now that Snap has gone public, Murphy has an estimated net worth of around $5.4 billion. Unlike Spiegel, Murphy has maintained a decidedly low profile since the beginning of the company. He's only given a handful of interviews, and little is known about his personal life. People who've worked with Murphy describe the 28-year-old as smart, friendly, and quiet. \"I'd describe him almost like a monk,\" Snapchat's first hire, David Kravitz, told Forbes in 2014. \"I don't think I've ever seen him upset.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Kennedy Odom, a 15-year-old from Memphis, suffered from a mysterious illness for months. She developed painful blisters and lesions in and around her mouth, couldn't chew or swallow food comfortably, and was too weak to go to school. Unable to eat, Kennedy lost 30 pounds. Doctors tested her for everything from strep throat to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (a rare skin disorder), but couldn't figure out what was wrong. \"Kennedy is my only child and just watching her suffer, you can't do anything to help your child and the people who are knowledgeable don't know how to help you,\" her mom Cicely Odom-Rose told WMC Action News 5. \"Here in Memphis everything is centered around food, so she would avoid eating and, of course, I would not want to eat around her.\" Frustrated, Cicely and Kennedy's godmother Tamara Irving turned to the Internet for answers. They wondered, since all of Kennedy's symptoms centered around her mouth, could the culprit be her braces? Most Popular Both Kennedy and Cicely got braces in February 2015. Nine months later, Kennedy got sick. It turns out that Kennedy is allergic to nickel, the material found in most braces. \"Where the nickel was touching her mouth, her mouth had the outbreak of these lesions,\" her periodontist Dr. Mitchel Godat told WMC Action News 5. \"In her case, she has a hyper-immune system for lots of things.\" Kennedy's braces were removed and she's now being treated by several doctors. Her family has racked up around $15,000 worth of medical debt for tests and prescriptions. If you have an allergy — or any other tiny medical detail, however unimportant you think it may be — it's crucial to let your doctors and dentists know.\n",

            "Paragraph: Someone Found A Ditto, And What Happened Next Was Pretty Sad – Pokemon Go Legendary Pokemon are currently unavailable in Legendary Pokemon are currently unavailable in Pokemon Go , but one legendary trainer has modified the game to make one other hidden Pokemon turn up. Ditto is a shape-shifting Pokemon, capable of copying an opponent’s Pokemon and also its move . It’s also currently the only non-legendary Pokemon unavailable in the game(including only 1st gen Pokemons) hence it joins the league of legendary Pokemons like Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo and Mew. Why Ditto is so special is still unclear, apart of its exclusive transformation ability. But there is a way to make it turn up Ditto in the game. For those tired of waiting to hear official news from Nintendo, this is a way to get a sneak peek of you favorite shapeshifter buddy. The legendary trainer FrozenAquaCat uploaded a video of his game and describing a bit of his tinker work in the video description. Weedle, a bug-type Pokemon, has a Pokedex number of 13. Incidentally, this coincides with his encounter ID, which is what the game client uses to tell your device which Pokemon you just discovered. The amazing trainer might realize that Ditto’s Pokedex number, and his encounter ID, just so happens to be 132. By modifying the Pokemon Go client, FrozenAquaCat was able to add the missing 2 to the ID, causing his next encounter with a Weedle to result in Ditto taking its place. Using the programming language Python, he was able to forcibly inject his code into the game using a technique that makes it playable on PC. Unfortunately, the game crashes if he attempts to throw a Pokeball at the Ditto, but we’re one step closer to making capturing Ditto a reality. Until then, we’ll just have to wait until someone figures out how to make Ditto appear officially . So till someone figures it out and let you all know, lets just charge our power banks and mobiles and get our asses moving to find the rest of Pokemons....! Until we meet next time.....Gotta catch em’ all.\n",

            "Paragraph: Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the light as emanating from within a black hole, rather than beside it. Corrections have been made to reflect this small but important distinction. In the epitomizing blackness of space, few natural phenomena can compete with the darkness of black holes. After all, with their inexorable gravitational pull, nothing, not even light, can be seen ... right? Well, mostly. Last week, for the first time ever, scientists observed visible light emanating from beside a black hole with nothing more than a 20 cm. telescope. Apparently, the rather beautiful phenomena occurs when, as the Guardian explains , \"material from surrounding space falls into them and releases violent bursts of light.\" Essentially, when some matter is sucked into one of these massive pits of gravity, they emit an incredible amount of energy, which can manifest itself as light. When this happens, it looks like we’re seeing light coming out of a black hole. Back in June of 2015 , a team of scientists led by Mariko Kimura of Kyoto University, became the first to ever see this sort of light through a telescope when a black hole named V404 Cygni, one of the closest to planet Earth, began showing activity after lying dormant for 26 years. Around every six and a half days, Cygni and its partner star (a celestial body a bit smaller than the sun) would circle one another, and when the black hole came to life again, it began feasting on the star. For two weeks, the astronomers were able to see flashes of light — some lasting just minutes, while others continued for several hours — as Cygni worked its magic.\n",

            "Paragraph: Jordan Rodgers didn’t just win JoJo Fletcher’s heart on \"The Bachelorette.\" He got his dream job, too. The former Vanderbilt quarterback is set to appear on the SEC Network as a college football analyst this season, and an ESPN executive says Rodgers earned the role on his talent alone. \"Our talent office had Jordan on their radar for some time. His name was in the initial group of names that we discussed when looking at people to bring to Charlotte [where the SEC Network is located] for auditions,\" Senior V.P. Stephanie Druley told SI.com. \"He played at Vanderbilt. He played quarterback. We had seen some interviews that he had done. So we reached out to him.\" Rodgers was unavailable for an audition at the time. Druley claims the network didn’t know what show he was shooting that kept him away, though ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney. When Aaron Rodgers’ youngest brother finally had his audition, he blew Druley away. \"It was clear he had a real passion and a deep knowledge of college football. The audition was really good — rare that someone walks in off the street and does an audition that we would be willing to air,\" she said. After Rodgers emerged as a front-runner on \"The Bachelorette,\" ESPN made him an offer a few weeks into the season. \"I had a real concern with how he would be viewed by fans of the show and what it might mean for him down the line,\" Druley said. \"He accepted the offer the day I was in an airport and saw Us Weekly with him splashed across the cover. Thankfully, the article didn’t live up to the headline, nor did a lot of the other ones I read.\" Rodgers has battled rumors he joined \"The Bachelorette\" for camera time instead of finding love. Though he and Fletcher are still engaged, his on-screen nemesis, Chad Johnson, called out Rodgers for using fame to his advantage. Rodgers talked about his professional endeavors during a conference call with reporters last week. \"I’ve been doing broadcasting for the past year — doing radio for ESPN and doing some TV stuff here and there — and I’ll be working with ESPN and SEC Network as a college football analyst,\" Rodgers said. \"That’s the conference I played in. That’s kind of my knowledge base.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Niagara, Iguazu, Victoria Falls: They’re some of the prettiest places in the world, but they’re definitely not secret. And if you don’t time your visit just right, you might end up having to elbow through crowds for the perfect photo op. Truth is, getting a smaller waterfall all to yourself can be just as big a thrill, especially when you can jump in for a private swim, surrounded by nothing more than jungle thickets, imposing boulders, and the roaring soundtrack of mother nature’s most dramatic work. Here are eight secret waterfalls worth working into your next vacation. The 19 Falls in Ecuador’s Cloud Forest There are probably far more than 19 waterfalls in Ecuador’s mist-shrouded cloud forest, set three hours north and west of Quito. But that’s the number of cascades that the guides at Mashpi Lodge, a 22-room eco-resort set on a 3,200-acre natural reserve, have found on their swath of the country’s verdant countryside. A handful are worked into the lodge’s daily hikes—restricted to groups of six—but you should prioritize Magnolia waterfall, which has a so-called \"natural jacuzzi.\" The Secret Falls of Sumba Island To get to these secret falls, you must first figure out where Sumba Island is. (It’s in Indonesia.) Then you have to book into Nihiwatu, one of the world’s most raved-about resorts. (Really, it’s won nearly every accolade possible.) From there, it’s a 45-minute drive through the Wanukaka Valley, on Sumba’s south shore, and then a 90-minute hike to the main event: a cascade, framed by 300-meter cliffs, whose water crashes into a swimmable blue lagoon.   Jurassic Falls, Kauai, Hawaii What’s in a name? A mouthful, if you go by the official one for \"Jurassic Falls,\" Manawaiopuna. To make things easier, it’s been nicknamed after the famous Steven Spielberg film that made the falls famous. Until recently, though, Jurassic Falls were totally inaccessible, thanks to their location deep in the interior of Hawaii's Kauai. Now you can get there with the help of Island Helicopters, which will fly you to the base of the 400-foot falls and take you on a short hike for the best views. (Pro tip: Stay at the St. Regis Princeville Resort and let the concierge coordinate your adventure.) Orkhon Waterfalls, Mongolia You don’t exactly think about waterfalls when you’re horseback riding through the steppes of Mongolia. They’re even more surprising come winter, when Mongolia turns into a frozen wonderland and the 20-foot-tall Orkhon Falls freeze over. But that’s what makes them so intriguing. Go with the help of Nomadic Expeditions, which works in stops at Orkhon on its 14-day Adventure Mongolia trips. Bali's \"In the Know\" Falls The InterContinental Bali Resort is surrounded by so many undiscovered cascades that its staffers put a list together as part of an insider guide called \"In the Know.\" Finding them can mean going on a rigorous hike or taking a breezy nature walk, so the concierge is trained to pair travelers with the right guides and waterfall excursions to fit their abilities and interests. The Machu Picchu Falls As if Machu Picchu weren’t already shrouded with mystery, the area immediately surrounding it is home to two little-known waterfalls. First is an unnamed cascade at the end of a walking trail on the grounds of the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, in Aguas Calientes; guides lead meditative twilight walks to the falls and point out pre-Inca petroglyphs along the way. Then there are the secluded Mandor falls, midway between the hotel and Machu Picchu. It’ll take a half-day to hike there, but the trail is home to speckled-faced parrots and green jays, and Inkaterra’s guides will gladly lead the way. Hellemobotn Falls, Norway The most famous falls get their cred from towering heights; this one, in Norway’s far north, stands out for being practically horizontal. Guides from Lindblad Expeditions long admired them, having spotted the splashing water from afar, but they never knew exactly how to see them up close. This summer, a group discovered steep trails leading straight to the source. See them for yourself on the company’s Norway’s Fjords and Arctic Svalbard expedition. The Picnic Waterfall, Thailand Dining under a waterfall can be a risky endeavor. (Just see what it’s like at this spot in the Philippines.) But Soneva Kiri, a luxe resort on Thailand’s least populated island, Koh Kood, turns it into the ultimate date night. Guests can ask the concierge to set up a \"destination meal\" for two at the base of a small cascade, where the mist spray isn’t substantial enough to ruin your Penang curry.\n",

            "Paragraph: A shocking sign was spotted on the front door of a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Gallipolis, Ohio. The sign prompted praise from people across social media after it went viral -- garnering over 4,000 shares and 9,000 likes on Facebook. It was posted to Ohio Going Blue’s page. \"All uniformed police officers eat free everyday all day,\" the sign read. \"This is a positive post, but some of you can't see the bigger picture. As an officer, I do not go into any establishment expecting/wanting ANYTHING to be free or let alone even a discount, whether I'm in uniform or not, and I can tell you other officers feel the same way. We don't like 'special treatment.' The fact is that KFC is acknowledging law enforcement, which is why this was posted,\" the administrator of Ohio Going Blue’s page wrote in a comment. \"To those who stated that other first responders should also be acknowledged. My answer? ABSOLUTELY.\" Even KFC employees commented on the post in support of officers: \"Yes we feed police officers for free EVERYDAY!!! I work at the Russell KY KFC!! We honor our protectors!! Now we need to give free dinners or food to the veterans also!! I am going to bring it to their attention next time I see the owners,\" the employee commented. \"They deserve everything they get and especially if it is free,\" another viewer posted. In an opposite incident, a Virginia police officer was denied service at a restaurant after one of the cooks refused to make food for the officer while she was in uniform. \"You better pull me off the line, because I'm not serving that,\" the cook allegedly said, Fox News reported. \"Well your first response as a police officer is anger,\" Police Chief Earl Cook said in response. \"These are very difficult times right now with our relations with everyone, and to have one of my officers treated in that manner unnecessarily -- your first response is anger, then you calm down a bit.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Diaper? Check. First feeding? Check. Swaddle? Check. Facebook pic? Check! According to a poll by photo website Posterista, pictures of newborns appear online within an hour of birth. Of the parents surveyed, the average time it took to share their newborns' first photo on a social media site was 57.9 minutes. They surveyed 2,367 parents of kids 5 and under. Seventy-seven percent of baby photos appear on the parents’ Facebook page, with Instagram trailing behind at 48 percent. And the numbers of baby photos being shared are rising. Since the birth of the Royal Baby, 74 percent of parents admitted that the little prince encouraged them to post online even more. Celebrity parents like Jimmy Fallon have joined in on the social media fun. Promptly after the birth of his daughter, Winnie Rose, he posted a GIF of her on Instagram. While some may not appreciate over-posting from parents, the survey found that only 22% of parents have bragging in mind when they post. A majority of parents polled just want to keep their friends and family well informed. Some reported using social media simply as memory storage. Mary Fischer wrote on The Stir that she wishes these social platforms were around when she gave birth. I mean, we appreciated the fact that everyone was taking an interest in our son and it was understandable that they wanted to hear all the details on his birth. But considering how emotionally and physically exhausted we were, we groaned pretty much every time the phone rang or we opened our inboxes. It would've been so nice to quickly upload photos and share them with everyone with one simple click. Maybe we actually would've had the much needed peace and quiet we were craving during that time. Tells us in the comments, when did you upload your baby's first photo online?\n",

            "Paragraph: It’s been less than 4 days since The Voice singer, Christina Grimmie, was shot and killed while signing autographs after her concert in Orlando, Florida. The tragedy has left her loved ones, fans, and fellow musicians not only heartbroken, but also confused. However, when I saw this lost footage of Christina Grimmie singing one of the most beautiful hymns of all time, my hope for humanity was restored. Christina Grimmie was one of the few outspoken Christians in the entertainment industry, and she even wrote in the caption of this video \"JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR and [I’m] not at all ashamed of it.\" The video we found features Grimmie performing \"In Christ Alone,\" a powerful, modern Christian song with lyrics that gave me chills — and left me in tears. She posted the video in celebration of Easter in 2012, which she referred to as her \"favorite holiday.\" \"No guilt in life, no fear in death, This is the power of Christ in me; From life’s first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of man, Can ever pluck me from His hand; Till He returns or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand.\" – \"In Christ Alone\" When I learned the details of Christina Grimmie’s faith in Jesus Christ, I knew she was in a much better place now. Grimmie was close friends with pop-star and Texas native, Selena Gomez, who made headlines after she broke down onstage the day after Grimmie’s life was taken. Gomez’s and Grimmie’s relationship dates back to when both were teenagers, and Gomez’s stepfather, Brian Teefey, became Grimmie’s manager after discovering her on YouTube. Grimmie was also the opening act for Gomez on the North American portion of her 2011 tour. My heart is absolutely broken. I miss you Christina pic.twitter.com/KWGwZZlj4t — Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) June 11, 2016 The pain from the tragic loss of Grimmie became unbearable for Gomez while she performed \"Nobody,\" her song that illustrates common Christian themes like salvation and keeping the faith. \"No oxygen, can barely breathe My darkest sin, you’ve raised release And it’s all because of You, all because of You I don’t know what it is, but you’ve pulled me in No one compares, could ever begin To love me like You do And I wouldn’t want them to\" – \"Nobody\" \"When she was 14, we met her and my parents and I signed her. One thing about Christina and her family is that she holds her faith so closely to her,\" Gomez said. \"She had faith, and I don’t really understand how this really happened, but I would like to dedicate this next song to her.\" That’s when Gomez started to perform \"Transfiguration\" by Hillsong Worship, a powerful Christian song with emotional lyrics. \"The only song my soul can find to sing Is Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah my King Lead my longing heart To the high ground, to the clear view And in awe I’ll be there Beholding You\" – Transfiguration Selena Gomez and Christina Grimmie weren’t just friends, they were sisters in Christ. Although Gomez may not understand God’s plan, she’s finding peace by trusting in it. When I learned the legacy Christina Grimmie left behind, I realized God was using her in extraordinary ways. Although she’s no longer a part of this lifetime, her legacy will continue teaching valuable life lessons for generations to come — and her performance of \"In Christ Alone\" is proof. Here’s 3 Things We Learned From Christina Grimmie: #1: Time is money, spend it wisely... \"Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.\" – Ephesians 5:15-17 Christina Grimmie may have only been 22-years-old when her life was taken, but she accomplished more in that short time than most adults ever will. The New Jersey native was considered a \"digital phenomena,\" with a YouTube following of more than 3 million subscribers worldwide — who she actively shared her faith in Jesus Christ with. In addition to Grimmie’s charming personality, her advanced musicianship is what captivated the entertainment industry. Unlike most YouTube stars, Christina Grimmie re-composed every cover she performed. When she auditioned with a rendition of \"Wrecking Ball\" on Season 6 of The Voice, all four judges turned their chairs around and fought for the chance to work with her. She finished in 3rd place on ‘Team Adam’ and in 2011, she independently released her first EP titled \"Find Me,\" which debuted at number 2 on iTunes, behind Adele’s \"19.\" Christina Grimmie made every second of her life count, and her untimely death illustrates the fragility of life. All we have is time and in an instant — you could be gone too. #2: Share your gift from God with the world... \"As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace.\" – 1 Peter 4:10 Christina Grimmie’s flawless voice was one of the most beautiful gifts we’ve ever seen God bless anyone with – and I’m so thankful she was brave enough to share it with the world at such a young age. Although we all have different gifts, we can all be inspired by Grimmie’s courage to share her gift of music at such a young age. The judges from NBC’s The Voice were vividly touched by Christina Grimmie, and it was her incredible singing that led them to her. Blake Shelton revealed he was \"stunned and disgusted and heartbroken that we lost that sweet little girl.\" Adam Levine made headlines when he offered to pay for her funeral. Levine revealed that he was \"absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Christina Grimmie’s death\" and that \"Christina was a natural, a gifted talent that comes along so rarely. She was taken from us too soon.\" Whether you like it or not, we all have gifts God gave us to serve one another. Christina Grimmie’s passion to share her faith in Jesus Christ through her impressive talent is a perfect example of sharing our gifts as devout stewards of God’s diverse grace. #3: Death is nothing to fear... \"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.\" – Ecclesiastes 7:1 Christina Grimmie’s performance of \"In Christ Alone\" and the powerful lyrics to this hymn reveal the beauty of trusting in God’s plan. It’s impossible to pick a favorite part from this video, but it’s possible to use an entire box of tissues while watching it. \"What heights of love, what depths of peace, when fears are stilled, when strivings cease! My Comforter, my All in All, here in the love of Christ I stand.\" – \"In Christ Alone\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Pink underwear, spiderwebs, and fried chicken. 1. Japan In the ’70s, KFC Japan began to promote fried chicken as a Christmas meal with its long running \"Kentucky for Christmas\" advertising campaign. Since then, eating KFC for Christmas dinner has become a tradition in Japan. 2. Argentina In Argentina, a family member (usually mom or grandma) gifts women pink underwear to be worn on NYE to attract love. 3. Estonia In Estonia, it’s customary to go to a sauna on Christmas Eve after preparing the house for the evening festivities. YASSS, PLEASE. 4. Czech Republic Stay with me here: In the Czech Republic, unmarried girls are supposed to throw a shoe over their shoulder in the direction of the nearest door. If the shoe lands with the toe pointing towards the door, the girl will get married. HEEL TO GOD. 5. Spain In Barcelona, you will find a wooden log with a smiley face wearing a traditional Catalan red hat. He’s called Caga Tio and he’s basically the Catalan equivalent of Santa Claus. According to tradition, kids are supposed to \"take care\" of Caga Tio from Dec. 8 to Christmas Eve. They cover him with a blanket and feed him turrón (or nougat). When it’s all said and done, Caga Tio then \"poops out\" gifts for everyone. 6. India In India, people decorate banana or mango trees with Christmas lights due to the lack of pine trees. 7. Ukraine Ukrainians decorate their Christmas trees with spiderwebs because it’s believed that the webs will bring good fortune and luck for the upcoming year. 8. France The \"13 desserts\" is a tradition from Provence in the south of France. They make 13 desserts to represent Jesus and the 12 apostles, and everything gets DEVOURED on Christmas Eve. 9. Sweden \"Julbock\" is a giant Swedish Christmas goat made of straw that lives in a town called Gävle. Every year since the late ’60s, it’s burned to the ground in the name of Christmas. 10. Mexico Carved radishes are displayed during the celebration of \"Night of the Radishes\" in Oaxaca, Mexico. It’s an annual carving event that has its origins in the colonial period when radishes were introduced by the Spanish. Farmers began carving radishes into figures as a way to attract customers attention during the Christmas market. 11. Latin America In most Latin American countries, baby Jesus delivers the gifts instead of Santa Claus. Can you imagine the biceps on that infant? 12. Austria, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic Central Europe is known for Krampus, a terrifying beast — and Santa’s evil counterpart — who beats people into being nice and not naughty. A more modern take on this involves a parade where people dress up as demons and march in the streets. 13. Colombia The Novena is an old Colombian tradition where people pray for nine successive days, from December 16th to December 24th. After prayer, they indulge in typical Christmas dishes like buñuelos, natilla, and empanadas.\n",

Days before the William Faulkner classic was set to arrive in theaters, however, it was announced that the film will not be shown on the big screen. Millennium Films, the distributor behind Franco's \"As I Lay Dying,\" scrapped plans for a theatrical release this week, THR reports. The company now plans to release the film on Oct. 22 on iTunes, and on Nov. 5 on DVD and VOD/iVOD. The film, which follows Faulkner's original story of death and honor, was reportedly seen as a \"difficult sell to a general audience rather than the art house crowd.\" Written, directed by and starring Franco, \"As I Lay Dying\" also features appearances by Danny McBride, Beth Grant and Tim Blake Nelson, among others.\n",

The 47-year-old host of Tucker Carlson Tonight joined the network just two months ago as a replacement for outgoing host Greta van Susteren. His 7 p.m. show has been a hit, averaging 2.8 million total viewers and posting strong ratings in the key 18-49 demo, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Carlson will begin hosting the 9 p.m. hour on Monday, January 9. Kelly’s last day at the network is Friday, January 6. \"In less than two months, Tucker has taken cable news by storm with his spirited interviews and consistently strong performance,\" Fox News chief Rupert Murdoch said in a statement. \"Viewers have overwhelmingly responded to the show and we look forward to him being a part of Fox News’ powerful primetime line-up.\" The move to 9 p.m. on cable’s most-watched network is Carlson’s biggest television gig yet; he hosted CNN’s The Spin Room and later, its innovative talk show Crossfire, before moving on to MSNBC for several years with his own show, called The Situation with Tucker Carlson, later renamed Tucker. In 2010, he founded the conservative news website The Daily Caller. The Drudge Report was the first to report the news of Carlson’s promotion. Meanwhile, Martha MacCallum will take over Carlson’s 7 p.m. slot with a new show titled The First 100 Days, which will center on President Donald Trump’s first three months in office, and Fox News reporter Shannon Bream will appear on America’s Newsroom opposite Bill Hemmer. \"Martha is a versatile and skilled anchor who has proven to be an essential component of our news programming. For the last 12 years, our viewers have trusted her reporting and we are pleased she will be part of our primetime line-up for the first 100 days of the new presidency,\" Murdoch said in a statement. Kelly, one of Fox News’s two biggest stars next to Bill O’Reilly, is leaving the network for her own daytime news show and Sunday night newsmagazine show on NBC. Her start date at the new network has not yet been announced.\n",

            "Paragraph: Find out which grocery items have skyrocketed in price lately (plus, a surprising food that has dropped). Price Up: Bacon  Experts began predicting that prices would zoom up last year after droughts affected feed crops, and then a new virus affecting pigs migrated to the U.S. this summer, further lowering supply of this high-demand meat. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost per pound of bacon has gone up 56 percent in 10 years (from $3.14 to $4.92) — compare that to beef steaks, which are up 41 percent in 10 years. In U.S. cities, the climb has been even steeper. Over the last 12 months alone, the average price of a pound of bacon in urban areas rose 22 percent to $5.62 per pound, up from $4.61 a year earlier. But if you use bacon as an accent instead of a main course, you’ll get the salty, smoky flavor without spending as much. This stew recipe calls for just two slices. Price Up: Chocolate  News that will give chocolate lovers pause: Not only is demand up for chocolate (thanks to seemingly endless reports of its health benefits) but supply is down, thanks to a shortage of cocoa beans in West Africa (the source for the majority of the world’s beans). The result? Chocolate prices have soared to $12.25 per kilo (that’s about 2 1/4 pounds) — up 45 percent from 2007, says The Wall Street Journal. Cocoa butter prices are rising, too (that’s what gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture), which means it’s costing manufacturers more to make their product. A slightly more expensive bar may still be worth it, though (here’s a scientific reason why you should indulge, even — or especially — when you’re stressed out). Price Up: Chicken  Surveys show 94 percent of us eat chicken, and nearly four in 10 consumers say they increased their consumption of this healthy choice from 2011 to 2012. But the price of chicken — particularly boneless breasts — has risen more than many other groceries in the past six months, finds a recent survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. That particular cut has risen 61 cents per pound, to $3.93. Bill Roenigk, chief economist for the National Chicken Council, says high corn (i.e., chicken feed) prices are partly to blame, as well as steady demand because of breast meat’s low fat and calorie content. You’ll spend less if you opt for leg meat, though Roenigk says dark meat tends to be cheaper than white, and isn’t much different, calorie-wise: about 58 calories per ounce for dark, versus 47 for white (and some experts believe it’s healthier for your heart). Price Up: Wild-Caught Fish  Wild-caught fish could be on its way to becoming a special treat: The global fish-price index of the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) hit a record high earlier this year, a result of increased demand and a surge in oil prices (which has a big impact on the cost of operating fishing boats and transporting the catch). Fish that is wild (not farmed) has seen the sharpest price hike, nearly doubling between 1990 and 2012, whereas the index for farmed fish rose by only a fifth (here’s why). Some of the best eco- (and wallet-) friendly options are farm-raised striped bass or farm-raised rainbow trout, which sell for about $8 a pound and have relatively light impact on the environment. That’s significantly lower than wild-caught fish that offer a similar taste and texture, such as cod (which ranges from $14 to $25 a pound) or halibut ($24 a pound). Price Down: Honeycrisp Apples  The \"designer\" apple known as honeycrisp is sweet, juicy, snappy — and (historically, anyway) pricey, costing as much as $4.50 a pound while in-season Cortlands went for $1.50 a pound. Whether because of the catchy name or the truly sweet taste, demand has jumped in recent years, and, until recently, supply couldn’t keep up, since apple trees take five or so years to begin producing fruit in enough quantities to sell commercially. (This fascinating article explains more.) Finally, though, all those honeycrisp trees are meeting demand, and the USDA’s National Fruit and Vegetable Retail report says the variety is actually now going for 14 percent less per pound than it was last year.\n",

            "Paragraph: Coming to rescue to a 24-week pregnant woman facing danger to her life due to an abnormality in the foetus, the Supreme Court on Monday granted her permission to terminate her pregnancy. The bench allowed a plea of a Mumbai-based 22-year-old woman to terminate her pregnancy after taking into account her medical report which of a team of seven doctors of King Edward Memorial(KEM) hospital in Mumbai.  The report says that the there was very little chance of survival of the foetus and the lady's life would be engendered if it was not aborted. The apex court had appointed the board of seven senior doctors to conduct a medical examination of the lady and directed it to file a report about her \"condition and advisability of permitting a medical termination of pregnancy\". Complying with its order, the board filed a report and favoured medical termination of the pregnancy. It said that the foetus was detected with anencephaly, a serious defect where parts of the skull are not adequately developed. On the basis board's suggestion, the bench allowed the lady to undergo an abortion and directed that the termination would be done under the supervision of the board. The court said that it was not necessary to go into \"medical and medico-legal aspect of the identity of the foetus and the matter is to be decided from the standpoint of the petitioner to preserve her life\". \"In these circumstances, we consider it appropriate and in the interest of justice, particularly the right of the petitioner to preserve her life, that she be allowed to undergo the termination of pregnancy. The termination shall be done by the doctors of KEM hospital. Further, the termination shall be supervised by the same medical board,\" the bench said. The court said, \"The foetus is not compatible with living outside the uterus. In other words, the foetus would not be able to survive. Equally, rather more important, the continuance of the pregnancy would endanger the physical and mental health of the petitioner\". The woman approached the court after doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy as it was not allowed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The law permits a woman to terminate her pregnancy till 20 weeks if two registered practitioners express the unanimous opinion that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or the foetus has severe abnormalities. This is the third incident in recent years when the apex court has allowed women to abort beyond the period prescribed by law. In July last year, the court had allowed a rape survivor's distress plea to abort her 24-week pregnancy citing serious abnormalities with the foetus. The court had allowed her to abort on the basis of a medical report from KEM hospital which said that foetus had serious abnormalities with slim chances of surviving the full term.

            "Paragraph: You might want to think twice before purchasing conventionally grown strawberries, spinach, or nectarines. According to a new report from the Environmental Working Group (EWG), these foods are the most likely to be contaminated with synthetic pesticide residue. The findings are part of the EWG’s 2017 \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen,\" a list of the most and least pesticide-ridden foods. To compile the ranking, the EWG analyzed tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug of more than 36,000 samples from 48 different types of conventionally grown produce. \"Even low levels of pesticide exposure can be harmful to infants, babies and young children, so when possible, parents and caregivers should take steps to lower children’s exposures to pesticides while still feeding them diets rich in healthy fruits and vegetables,\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, in a statement. For the second year in the row, the EWG found that strawberries were the most contaminated fruit. Just last year, the red berry knocked apples—which held the title of most contaminated for five years—from the top spot. Pesticide residue has increased in strawberries because of out-of-season demand. This year, the most contaminated strawberry had traces of 20 different pesticides. Also moving up on the list this year are spinach and nectarines. Spinach jumps from the eighth to the second most contaminated product. The USDA found spinach samples contained more residue by weight than all other produce tested, and 75 percent of samples contained residue of permethrin, an insecticide that is used to treat lice and repel mosquitos. In high doses, it can cause damage to the nervous system. So what conventionally grown produce is safe to purchase? Sweet corn, according to the EWG. Only 1 percent of samples of both sweet corn and avocados (last year’s top pick) had any detectable pesticides. Though you’re safe from pesticide residue because of the food’s protective exterior, it’s important to note that the EWG does warn that a small amount of sweet corn, as well as papaya and summer squash, are produced from genetically modified seeds. (Buy organic if you’re trying to avoid altered produce.) The EWG lists, which started in 1993, have gained a reputation among many notable doctors and health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, for reducing pesticide exposure in diets. But the Dirty Dozen list has also attracted some criticism for focusing on quantity of pesticides rather than toxicity. According to Sonya Lunder, EWG senior analyst, the group has taken to highlighting crops, like hot peppers this year, as the \"Dirty Dozen Plus.\" These produce picks don’t meet the traditional criteria, but have been found to have residue of highly toxic pesticides on them. Additionally, some critics have pointed out that the levels of pesticide residue found on the food in this list, though higher than other fruits and vegetables, are generally still well below EPA tolerance levels. However, the EWG stands behind their list and cautions consumers to pay attention to any substantial trace of synthetic pesticide. Lunder told RealSimple.com in an e-mail that in the past, the Environmental Protection Agency has \"revoked tolerances\" or changed legal limits or altogether banned certain insecticides thought to be safe after revising risk assessment. For example, last fall the tolerances for Chlorpyrifos, a pesticide once widely detected on fruits and vegetables, were revoked after it no longer met the EPA’s safety standards. The Dirty Dozen: Strawberries, Spinach, Nectarines, Apples, Peaches, Pears, Cherries, Grapes, Celery, Tomatoes, Sweet bell peppers, Potatoes The Clean Fifteen: Sweet corn, Avocados, Pineapples, Cabbage, Onions, Sweet peas, frozen Papaya, Asparagus, Mangos, Eggplant, Honeydew, Melon, Kiwi, Cantaloupe, Cauliflower, Grapefruit\n",

            "Paragraph: Ever since the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act in June, Grace Wojcik has kept a packet of official paperwork stuck to the fridge with a magnet. When her partner lines up at a county clerk's office Wednesday, documents in hand, the pair hopes they'll be issued a marriage license in a state where same-sex marriage is currently not allowed. Wojcik and her partner, Jess, are waiting to hear the results of a case that challenges Michigan's gay marriage ban. U.S. District Court Judge Bernard Friedman will hear arguments in Detroit Wednesday and is expected to issue a ruling the same day. \"When I heard that people were trying to challenge that ... I can't quite put into words just how excited I was, and also, nervous,\" said Wojcik, who is 27. \"Nervous because this could be a chance for Michigan to finally move forward ... but also nervous that instead of it being a positive thing, it could also be a reminder of just how much discrimination the community still faces.\" LGBT advocacy groups are prepared for the possibility that Friedman will overturn the ban. They have urged that in that event, couples who want to get married do it quickly before the case is appealed. Several counties have agreed to issue licenses -- including Oakland, where Wojcik plans to go. Wojcik and her partner live in Farmington Hills and had a marriage ceremony last summer. Though they considered going to a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, they decided it was too expensive and more important to have their friends and family attend their wedding. \"It's more than just the piece of paper, because for us, we [consider ourselves] married, but there are a lot of things that we don't get the benefit of having,\" Wojcik said. She referenced estate planning, tax issues, protecting their future children in the case of one parent's death, and having their home state recognize their relationship. \"I don't even know how that would be, to go through everyday life and you wouldn't have to think about those things,\" she said. When plaintiffs April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse began legal proceedings in Wednesday's case, the couple planned to challenge restrictions on joint adoption by same-sex partners. The two have three children, but aren't both legally considered their parents. However, Friedman invited them to instead challenge the gay marriage ban itself. Wojcik will be paying close attention to see if couples statewide will have a chance to make their relationships official. Jess plans to go wait at the county clerk's office just in case there's a chance she can go ahead and apply for a license as soon as the ban is overturned. The pair's relationship began three years ago, when Wojcik met Jess on Match.com. On their first date, they talked for hours. \"I knew she would be someone who would have a big impact on my life,\" she said. Though they intended to take it slowly at first, Jess proposed less than a year after they met. \"We like to joke, there was a moment [on our second or third date] when she knew that she could spend her life with me. ... Instead of watching some musical I asked if we could watch a Red Wings game,\" Wojcik said. But their \"happily ever after\" story is marred by the reality of living as a gay couple in Michigan. Wojcik asked that Jess not be identified by her last name because their relationship is a secret from her employer -- in Michigan, you can be fired for being gay. \"We don't consider ourselves that abnormal. We have a dog, we have a house, we pay our taxes, we go to work, we volunteer in our community,\" Wojcik said. \"The only thing that's different about us is there's two women in a relationship.\" The gay marriage ban was approved in 2004 with 59 percent of the vote. Wojcik, who was in high school at the time, said she's seen a shift in how LGBT individuals are treated in Michigan in the last nine years. When the Defense of Marriage Act was overturned, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette issued a statement. \"Michigan’s Constitution stands and the will of the people to define marriage as between one man and one woman endures in the Great Lakes State,\" he said. In September, he filed a brief in the case stating the state's definition of marriage was needed to \"regulate sexual relationships\" and their \"unique procreative capacity.\" If given the chance, Wojcik said, she'd like to invite Schuette to her house for dinner, so he could see \"how normal\" she and Jess are. \"I would hope he understands there is a human element to this, it's not all policy,\" she said.\n",

            "Paragraph: And brands don't even have to list it on the label Lawmakers are calling for a ban on a carcinogenic ingredient commonly found in body washes and lotions. When it comes to grooming, we slather and lather beauty products onto our skin in an effort to look better and smell fresher. But what exactly is the true cost of our vanity?  Chances are, once your products go down the drain you don’t stop and think about what could be in them. Or maybe you did when microbeads – the small pieces of plastic in facial scrubs and makeup – made headlines last year.  Now, a new ingredient is coming under fire; 1,4-dioxane.  Found in everything from body washes to hand soaps and lotions, the Environmental Protection Agency claims it is a likely carcinogen. But despite that, it’s still found in a shocking 46 per cent of products and brands aren’t even required to list it on the label. What’s more, it has an EWG (Environmental Working Group) score of 8 – 10 being the most toxic – and is already banned in Canada. A byproduct of other chemicals used in beauty products 1,4-dioxne can often escape your attention on the list of ingredients. And because the regulation of cosmetic and personal-care products is so ambiguous it can be represented under a host of complex different names like PEG, polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, and polyoxyethylene.  As such, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is calling for the ingredient, which he claims causes eye, nose and throat irritation, to be removed from all personal care products in the US.  Luckily, Schumer insists that 1,4-dioxane is relatively easy for brands to eradicate noting in a statement that \"vacuum stripping\" is a cost-effective way to remove it from personal care formulations.\n",

            "Paragraph: These Overwatch Fans Are so Desperate, They’re Roleplaying Overwatch in Another Video Game How excited are you for Overwatch? Maybe a lot, but not as much as these guys. A YouTuber called eNinja and his friends, instead of waiting for the launch of the game, decided to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive as Overwatch characters. I am not really sure whether it is productive or not, but the result is definitely entertaining. The group’s Counter Strike squad consisted of Overwatch characters Tracer, Widowmaker, McCree, Bastion and Roadhog. They did match the avatars and the names of the characters in the game. Apart from matching the names and avatars, the team also role-played the whole game as the Overwatch characters. They almost made Counter Strike look like Overwatch with their style of play and the messages. Everyone used the catch phrases of their respective characters. A player almost looked like a turret when McCree started to moving around firing shots from an R8 revolver while Bastion stayed glued to one spot scanning the opponents and killing anyone who comes to his range. Overwatch releases worldwide on May 24 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. You can have a look at the video below.\n",

            "Paragraph: Justin Timberlake had an interesting night in Philadelphia. While performing at the Wells Fargo Center, he had his rear end grabbed in the middle of a song. Luckily the veteran performer was able to literally shake off the awkward situation. E! Online reports that at Timberlake's 20/20 Experience World Tour on Tuesday a fan suddenly reached up from the audience and tried to grab a piece of the 33-year-old performer's glutes. Undeterred by the handsy fan, JT managed to swat away the woman -- while still keeping rhythm. The whole thing was so sudden that most of the crowd barely noticed. Timberlake has had to deal with an odd crowd on several different occasions. In November, he noticed a female fan flipping him the bird and stopped to address the situation. \"Why are you flipping me off?\" the performer asked in between songs. \"You got second row to flip me the bird? That makes no f---ing sense.\" The in-audience culprit appeared to respond, and Timberlake continued: \"Oh you wanted me to see you? You’re in the second row, I’ll see you because you’re in the second row.\" He laughed off the situation and admitted that the fan’s ploy technically worked. He then realized that he'd just inadvertently encouraged the crowd to give him the finger. \"OK, lets all do it just to get it over with,\" he said while flipping off the audience. Despite calling it the \"weirdest moment he’s ever had with a crowd,\" the \"Take Back the Night\" singer moved the show forward and launched immediately into his song \"Summer Love.\"\n",

            "Topic: 5 Signs Of High Emotional Intelligence\n",
            "Paragraph: Emotional intelligence predicts people's ability to regulate themselves, manage other people, and achieve success. Research shows a link between emotional intelligence and career success. Not everyone is born with it, but unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can be acquired and improved with practice. So, how can we tell if someone's got it or not? Here are five signs of people with high emotional intelligence. These are qualities that are easy to assess in every day situations. Credit: Shutterstock Sign No. 1: They handle criticism without denial, blame, excuses or anxiety. One of the hallmarks of high emotional intelligence is self-awareness. Self-awareness is a deep understanding of what makes us tick; what angers us, makes us happy, bores and interests us. It's also means that we can appraise ourselves, faults and all, with great honesty and clarity. So when people with high emotional intelligence make a mistake and get criticized for it, it doesn't send them into an emotional tailspin. It's simply a fact to be noted, analyzed and corrected. Not everyone with high emotional intelligence reacts to criticism in the same exact way. Some people deal with it more empathically, and instantly wonder Why did this person just criticize me? And they seek to understand what does this criticism mean for our working relationship moving forward? Others handle criticism more like a process engineer looking to root-cause a product defect, systematically dissecting every step leading up to the thing they just got criticized for. Their first thought is I need to figure out exactly what went wrong. If you want to discover your personal style of handling criticism, you can take this free quiz, How Do You React To Constructive Criticism? Regardless of the exact nature of their reaction, people with high emotional intelligence do not deny it, blame others, make excuses or melt into a pool of anxiety. If you've ever heard people say, That rule doesn't apply to me or My performance was just fine (when it clearly wasn't), you've witnessed denial. These are folks who are so defensive and walled-off, or their egos are so fragile, that they're simply not ready for feedback. They are, in effect, saying, There's no problem; my performance was absolutely fine. If you don't like the results, that's a problem with your judgment, not my performance. Others exhibit blame. Blame is the unspoken acknowledgment that constructive feedback is warranted (i.e., the outcomes were subpar) coupled with an unwillingness to admit any personal fault. You'll hear things like OK, results weren't perfect, but if you want to know where the problem is, go talk to Accounting about why they didn't get the right data to my team before the deadline. Excuses are another reaction common to folks with lower emotional intelligence. An excuse is an admission of subpar results plus an admission of fault that is coupled with a host of extenuating factors that no normal human could possibly have overcome. Unlike blame, it won't be another person or department that gets thrown under the bus but rather your servers, procedures, phone systems, and the like. Then there's anxiety. Here, the actual subpar performance and culpability have been fully acknowledged, but the person lacks the readiness to move forward and improve future performance. People in anxiety say things like, There's no way we'll finish in time or We've tried to fix this before, and it just didn't work. Sign No. 2: They're open-minded. A high level of self-awareness lets emotionally-intelligent people listen to a situation without reacting to judgment. They don't automatically dismiss ideas just because they are different from their own. This makes them a popular go-to person when there's trouble, issues, challenges or just a need for a sympathetic ear. You won't find them chit-chatting all day, or tolerating negative personalities, but they do have a knack for helping people quickly set things right. Sign No. 3: They're good listeners. Great listening requires a developed listening structure that separates the facts from interpretations, reactions and ends. People with emotional intelligence can identify the emotions that shut down their ability to listen. They've worked at developing the ability to divorce themselves from those emotions so they can remain open and able hear what is really being said. Sign No. 4: They don't sugarcoat the truth. Emotional intelligence requires recognizing emotions in others, but this other awareness doesn't mean shying away from speaking the truth or using tricks to try and soften the blow of tough feedback. People with emotional intelligence know how important it is that tough messages get heard. You won't hear blatant candor that could possibly shut down the conversation, but you will hear a clear message that might sound something like this: Frank, I've got a tough message to deliver. There's no getting around it, but I want you to understand that I'm doing this out of a concern for your wellbeing. Because if you don't fix this stuff, your career here is in jeopardy. Sign No. 5: They apologize when they're wrong. People with high emotional intelligence don't invest valuable time trying to prove they are right when they realize they're wrong. Instead of looking for excuses, they offer a simple, honest apology that lets them quickly get back on track. It sounds something like this: I'm sorry I messed up and chose some bad words that sounded like I was attacking you. This is not what I intended. Can I try again? There are many indicators that someone has high emotional intelligence. But these five signs are quick tests that you can witness every day at work. And they'll quickly help you assess whether the person in question does, or does not, have high levels of emotional intelligence.

            "Paragraph: Considering how popular Nintendo’s little blast from the past is likely to be, this is a pretty important question. Not many video game hardware projects are absolute no-brainers, but the Mini NES Classic Edition — officially going by the unwieldy name Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition — checks off all the boxes. Not only does it give you serious bang for the buck by including 30 popular Nintendo games for a suggested retail price of just $60, but it allows people to stop using emulators or figuring out ways to get their original console to work with today’s TV tech. Even people who don’t normally consider themselves gamers are anxious for it to arrive. For a company like Nintendo that was in real need of huge hits to shake things up, the one-two punch of Pokemon GO and the NES Classic Edition this year couldn’t have arrived at a more opportune time. But there’s a problem, or rather, there’s going to be a problem. The NES Classic Edition is likely to be a victim of its own popularity. It’s going to be difficult to keep in stock, especially when you factor in Nintendo’s rather ... checkered past when it comes to its ability to ratchet up supply to meet demand. In other words, if you think you’ll be able to roll into a store on November 11 and just pick one up, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. The answer, of course, is to pre-order one, or maybe more than one considering how hot these are going to be. Unfortunately, the NES Classic Edition is not available for pre-order just yet. Indeed, a glance at the Indeed, a glance at the page Amazon has set aside for the product simply gives you the depressing \"currently unavailable\" message.

            "Paragraph: Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, gas giant, and subject of the Juno mission , is huge. Huge. It's so huge, in fact, that it doesn't actually orbit the sun. Not exactly. With 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined, it's big enough that the center of gravity between Jupiter and the sun doesn't actually reside inside the sun — rather, at a point in space just above the sun's surface. Here's how that works. When a small object orbits a big object in space, the less massive one doesn't really travel in a perfect circle around the larger one. Rather, both objects orbit a combined center of gravity. In situations we're familiar with — like Earth orbiting the much-larger sun — the center of gravity resides so close to the center of the larger object that the impact of this phenomenon is negligible. The bigger object doesn't seem to move, and the smaller one draws a circle around it. But reality is always more complicated. For example: When the International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth, both the Earth and the space station orbit their combined center of gravity. But that center of gravity is so absurdly close to the center of the Earth that the planet's motion around the point is impossible to spot — and the ISS describes a near-perfect circle around the whole planet. The same truth holds when most planets orbit the sun. Sol is just so much larger than Earth, Venus, Mercury, or even Saturn that their centers of mass with the sun all lie deep within the star itself. Not so with Jupiter. The gas giant is so big that its center of mass with the sun, or barycenter, actually lies 1.07 solar radii from the middle of the sun — or 7% of a sun-radius above the sun's surface. Both the Sun and Jupiter orbit around that point in space. This not-to-scale gif from NASA illustrates the effect: That is, in essence, how Jupiter and the sun move through space together — though the distances and sizes are far different. Jupiter is still only a fraction of the sun's size. But next time someone asks you for a crazy space fact you'll know: Jupiter is so massive, it doesn't orbit the sun.\n",

            "Paragraph: We recently asked the BuzzFeed Community about the things that annoy them the most in rom-com movies. Here are some of the best results they submitted. 1. Airport dash scenes. Why do they always need to rush to the airport?  Why not just call them? Or book a plane ticket? They're not gonna drop off the face of the Earth. 2. Also, let's be honest, airport security is a joke in rom-com world.  3. Single people can apparently afford to have really nice apartments in big cities.  How is that possible? We can afford a box in a basement. 4. And then there are the small details that just don't add up.  For example, in Leap Year they go to an outdoor wedding, in Ireland, in February! And then to top it off they sleep on a bench after said wedding. The average temperature in Ireland in February is 5°C (41°F). 5. There's always a guy who is an absolute jerk who somehow becomes the main love interest.  He's a jerk. No thank you. 6. And what about the \"he's a fuckboy but there's something different about him\" clichè? Hmm?  7. Or a man who pursues a woman who isn't interested in him or even vehemently dislikes him.  Is this OK? IS IT??? 8. In fact, the normalisation of the stalking that characters do to win or win back the ones they want is pretty worrying when you think about it.  Is stalking OK? Let me think... Nope. 9. There's also always the message being sent out that guys are the be-all and end-all of EVERYTHING.  What is with all these women who have wonderful lives, Nora Jones-beautiful kitchens, and supportive friends, but somehow they are deeply unhappy because they are single? SINGLE! GOD NO! There's more to life than getting a guy, btw. 10. And what about the cheating? SO. MUCH. CHEATING. And it's condoned and always results in ultimate happiness.  Please see: The Notebook, Love Actually, You've Got Mail, Letters to Juliet, Something Borrowed, to name but a few... 11. Apparently females only have one kind of job – being a writer or working in fashion.  Every other profession must be run by men. 12. There's always a friend who's unlucky in love because she's too outspoken and confident to get a man.  What is wrong with confidence? 13. And what about the questionable relationships that are actually kinda creepy in rom-coms?  Cher ends up dating her stepbrother in Clueless. I KNOW, they're not blood-related, but that's still kind of weird, is it not? And the teacher falling for a pretend student in Never Been Kissed. Don't tell me that's not odd as well. 14. Makeovers. So. Many. Makeovers. Apparently you can only get a guy if you conform to society's beauty standards.  15. Especially by just taking your glasses off. Apparently glasses = ugly, no glasses = instant attraction.\n",

But California also has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly one in four Californians -- about 24 percent of the overall population -- lives in poverty. Behind California, the District of Columbia and Nevada have the second and third highest poverty rates, according to the analysis. Across the U.S., about 16 percent of Americans live in poverty. The census analysis considered income, government benefits, taxes and cost of living. The official poverty threshold for a two-adult-two-child family was $23,283 in 2012. What to do about these grim statistics? For one, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in September the highest minimum wage in the nation, to be rolled out over the next three years. California's minimum wage will bump from $8 to $9 an hour in July 2014, and then up to $10 an hour in January 2016. Brown also fought tooth and nail last year to get voters to pass Proposition 30, which raises income taxes on the wealthiest Californians to help fund K-12 schools, community colleges and state universities. The measure is desperately needed, as California's education system ranks 36th in the nation, with a C grade, in Quality Count's 2013 report. California educates about one-eighth of the nation's students. But Prop 30 is just a temporary fix -- a \"band-aid,\" Gerston said. California's education system desperately needs more funds, and the state's poor need more social services. And getting initiatives passed that address these issues may prove to be an uphill battle, as Gerston pointed out. Part of the problem is that those at the bottom don't vote nearly as much as those at the top, Gerston said. In California, this is exacerbated because recent immigrants are even less likely to vote. But Gerston is optimistic that democracy will catch up with immigration. As more immigrants have been here for second and third generations, percentages of Latinos and Asian American voters have crept up, he said. \"You will see the legislature filled with more and more people reflecting the state's demographics,\" he said. \"The voting turnout will eventually be a majority of non-whites.\" And those non-whites and low-income Californians will vote in their own interest, as voters always do, Gerston said. \"Give this another 20 years, and you're going to see a state that's markedly different.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: That the pockmarked face of the Moon was caused by billions of years of collisions is well known, but we are only now able to understand just how big the asteroids hitting our satellite really were. Researchers Pete Schultz and David Crawford from Brown University have analyzed a famous impact crater within the Mare Imbrium (the Sea of Showers). The latest observation suggests a lower limit for the size of the bolide – a bright meteor – of 250 kilometers (155 miles) in diameter, much larger than previously thought. The size put it in the class of proto-planetary asteroids, objects large enough to be the likely precursors of planets. Its impact on the Moon has been significant, leaving a 1,250-kilometer-diameter (775 miles) crater. \"We show that Imbrium was likely formed by an absolutely enormous object, large enough to be classified as a protoplanet,\" said Pete Schultz, professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Brown University, in a statement. \"This is the first estimate for the Imbrium impactor’s size that is based largely on the geological features we see on the Moon.\" The size of the impactor is not the only interesting find in this study, which is published this week in Nature. The researchers were also able to explain the so-called Imbrium Sculpture, a pattern of grooves that extend radially around the crater, as well as a second set of grooves extending from a region to the northwest of the crater center. \"This second set of grooves was a real mystery,\" Schultz said. \"No one was quite sure where they came from.\" The scientists used virtual and physical models to work out how the second set of grooves formed. They believe chunks from the main object broke apart and hit the Moon before the main body. Some of the chunks might even have escaped our satellite’s gravity, and hit the Moon or Earth at a later time. This discovery could significantly expand our understanding of the Late Heavy Bombardment when comets and asteroid were repeatedly hitting the rocky planets of the Solar System. \"The Moon still holds clues that can affect our interpretation of the entire Solar System,\" Schultz added. \"Its scarred face can tell us quite a lot about what was happening in our neighborhood 3.8 billion years ago.\"\n",

            "Topic: You’ll never believe what this star of the cult film \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\" does now\n",
            "Paragraph: By John Kelly, The Washington Post A razor-sharp chisel in hand, Zev Zalman \"Z.Z.\" Ludwick leans into the violin he is making and shaves off a sliver of wood. It curls up, a simulacrum of the Hasidic curls — payot — that hang on either side of his bearded face. Classical music plays over the radio in the basement workshop of his Silver Spring, Maryland, home. I ask Z.Z. what sort of music he used to listen to. \"Scorpions, with their original guitarist, Uli Roth,\" he says. \"I was a big fan of Zeppelin, Hendrix. I really liked Black Sabbath, on the heavier side. Yngwie Malmsteen. I really like music that’s just super complex. My favorite classical music is Paganini. He was the cream of the crop. He was like a violin shredder.\" Z.Z. has always liked shredders. One day in 1986, a shirtless, suspendered and doubtless chemically altered Z.Z. — then known as Robbie Ludwick — was partying outside a Judas Priest concert in suburban Washington, D.C., when filmmakers Jeff Krulik and John Heyn happened by. His drunken enthusiasm for the band earned Z.Z. a spot in their cult documentary \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot.\" At first, Z.Z. didn’t even know about the film — or that he was in it. \"I found out about two years after,\" he says. \"I was playing in a heavy metal band called SteelWynch — now they’re called Black Widow — and the singer, Cathy, said, ‘Hey, you’re in the movie we saw the other night. I couldn’t believe that was you.’ \" The film was an underground hit and bequeathed an underground fame on Z.Z., who worked at a Wheaton, Maryland, pizza restaurant and played bass around town. \"I had a friend of mine call me from L.A. who said, ‘Your picture is on a telephone pole out here.’ My face became the poster child for that movie. Turned out there was a picture in Penthouse magazine of me. Figure that one out.\" Z.Z. never achieved Judas Priest-level success, but not for lack of trying. Washington Post photo by John Kelly Zev Zalman \"Z.Z.\" Ludwick, a luther and stringed-instrument repair man, sits in the workshop in his Silver Spring, Maryland, home. Z.Z. is a former heavy metal bass player — seen in the cult film \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\" — who embraced Hasidic Judaism in 2006. When Z.Z. gets into something, he gets into it. In 2001, he experienced a reawakening of his Jewish heritage. In 2006, he embraced Hasidic Judaism. \"I was never into that organized prayer, ‘Page 232’ stuff,\" he says. He gravitated toward a sect called Breslov, named after a rabbi from Ukraine who described an intimate, personal relationship with God. Breslov also stressed the importance of music. \"Rebbe Breslov said song is as lofty, if not more lofty, than prayer,\" Z.Z. says, \"especially songs that don’t have lyrics. Wordless melodies, he called them.\" Sort of like a heavy-metal guitar solo. After years of slinging pizzas, working as a brewer and in a bakery, Z.Z. wanted something more stable. He loved music and was good at shop in high school, so in 2004, he talked his way into a job at Potter’s Violins, where he learned the basics of repair. Last fall Z.Z. opened his own shop, Ludwick’s House of Violin. The logo is a fiddler on a roof. Most of his work is repairs and restoration, but he’s building an instrument from scratch under the tutelage of famed Maryland luthier Howard Needham. Z.Z. just turned 53. He’s married to Sherrie and has two daughters and a stepson. Does today’s Z.Z. – the one who on the Sabbath turns off his phone, doesn’t drive or touch a switch — recognize the 22-year-old from \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\"? \"I do recognize that guy,\" he says. \"I even remember that day, which is unbelievable because those of us who were really there usually don’t remember, because of all the things we were partaking. It’s like looking at an old snapshot.\" Seeing the heavy-metal kid reminds Z.Z. of those dress-up booths at a beach or amusement park, where you put on cowboy clothes and get your picture taken. \"Here’s this guy that’s me, but it’s not me,\" he says. \"I’m completely different. Back then I was self-indulgent, egotistical, just cared about physical gratification. ... Looking back at that heavy-metal guy, I did a lot of things I wasn’t proud of. I take a lot of pride now in who I am as a father, who I am as a husband, who I am as a community member.\" He knows his life sounds like an episode of VH1’s \"Behind the Music.\" \"That is bizarre,\" Z.Z. says. \"Here’s a heavy-metal guy, and now he’s a Hasidic violin maker.\" \"It was all about having fun,\" he says. \"We were living the lifestyle. I wanted to be a rock star. I was doing exactly what rock stars do: overindulgence in everything. That’s the kind of person I am.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Battlefield 1 multiplayer factions won’t include these two major countries at launch Battlefield’s Twitter account confirmed the multiplayer factions of Battlefield 1 yesterday. They replied with the names of the following countries when fans asked which nations will be included in the multiplayer version of the game. It looks like you can play as the following: British, German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, Ottoman, and American. It was confirmed that France and Russia, who played major roles in World War 1, will not feature in the game, at least in the launch build of the game. This has left the fans wondering why these two nations were omitted at launch. This comes as quite a surprising decision on DICE’s part, considering both France and Russia played an important role in World War 1 and lost more than a million soldiers each who served on the frontlines. However, it was revealed later that the French will be included in the multiplayer through a DLC pack. Julien Wera of DICE, in an interview with Lemonde, said that they acknowledged the importance of France’s contribution to World War 1, and hence decided to include French troops as a dedicated DLC post launch. Wera didn’t mention whether the DLC will be a paid or a free one. Earlier to this, people were also critical of EA’s decision to not include female soldiers in the multiplayer version of the game.\n",

            "Topic: Now living by a busy road raises risk to pregnant women: Expectant mothers are more at risk to pre-eclampsia if they are regularly exposed to traffic noise and pollution \n",
            "Paragraph: Expectant mothers living close to busy roads are at greater risk of serious complications in pregnancy, experts have found. Pre-eclampsia – a condition suffered by 42,000 pregnant women in Britain each year – is made more likely by noise and pollution from roads, according to a large study. Researchers believe the toxins from vehicles and sound of traffic from nearby roads may increase stress levels and cause inflammation that leads to rising blood pressure associated with the condition. The Danish study of 73,000 women - the first to establish a link between traffic and pre-eclampsia - adds to growing concerns about the health impact of air and noise pollution. Earlier this week a separate study published in the Lancet medical journal warned people who live near roads are also at significantly higher risk of developing dementia. Those concerns add to established evidence that traffic fumes increase the risk of heart disease and asthma. NHS watchdog NICE last month called for urgent action to tackle the problem, warning that air pollution contributes towards 25,000 deaths a year in England - almost 5 per cent of all deaths. Despite overwhelming evidence of health inpacts, the UK has struggled to control air pollution, with 37 cities across Britain persistently breaching legal limits of air toxins set by the EU. Pre-eclampsia affects around 6 per cent of pregnancies in the UK - and in severe cases can lead to stillbirth or maternal death. The new results may help to explain why until recently rates of preeclampsia have been increasing in many countries. It could also provide some clues about the underlying causes of pre-eclampsia. Researchers found that for every 10-decibel increase in noise from traffic – roughly a doubling in audible volume - there was a 10 per cent increase in the risk of pre-eclampsia and high blood pressure problems in pregnant women. Similarly, for every 0.01 micrograms of nitric dioxide from car exhausts in a litre of air - a tiny increase - the risk of the condition rose by 7 per cent. Study leader Professor Marie Pedersen, of the University of Copenhagen, said: ‘The rise in risk we saw is significant in terms of impact on a population level, as a 10-unit increase in pollution and noise is very small.’ Pre-eclampsia usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can lead to problems with the flow of blood through the placenta. Warning signs include high blood pressure, swelling in their feet, face and hands, severe headaches, vision problems and pain below the ribs. As the delivery of nutrients can be hampered by the problems with the placenta, it can restrict the growth of the unborn baby. There is currently no cure for the condition and often babies need to be delivered early to prevent it from worsening. Pre-eclampsia and hypertensive disorders are among the leading causes of maternal death and stillbirth. Around 500 babies are thought to die in the UK each year as a result of the condition. Those at the highest risk include women who are obese, have high blood pressure before they are pregnant, those suffer from diabetes or have a family history of preeclampsia. Professor Pedersen said her study shines new light on the root causes of the condition, which has been poorly understand in the past. She said: ‘Air pollution causes inflammation and oxidative stress, which has been linked to damage to blood vessels, immune system changes and elevated blood pressure. ‘Noise may induce stress and disturb sleep, which has also been associated with similar changes. ‘We observed the strongest effects for mild pre-eclampsia and early-onset of pre-eclamsia.’ She and her colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Epidemiology, studied data collected from 72,745 pregnancies in Denmark and modelled the noise and air pollution at their addresses. They found women living in areas where road traffic was heaviest in their first three months of pregnancy had the highest risk of developing pre-eclampsia, when all other factors had been controlled for. Even when they tried to separate noise from air pollution they found both seemed to have an impact on the condition. Mothers living close to busy airports, where the noise of aircraft continually taking off and landing can be heard, and train routes also have an increased risk. Professor Pederson said: ‘If our findings are true, they could have public health implications given the large burden associated with these outcomes and the fact that exposure to both air pollution and noise are difficult to avoid in modern society. ‘We expect that the findings from our study and other studies add support to policies that aim to reduce exposure to air pollution and noise.’ Professor James Walker of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said: ‘This research into traffic noise is interesting and warrants further investigation – especially as there is increasing evidence on the impact of increased air pollution from cars on poor health. ‘While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is unknown, it is important to reassure women that there are likely to be a variety of contributory factors that lead to a diagnosis – probably to do with the placenta - rather than just exposure to traffic noise.'\n",

            "Paragraph: On September 9 the Queen becomes the longest-reigning monarch in British history. But Her Maj is determined reign will not stop play and has ruled there should be \"no fuss\" about her momentous milestone. Instead, it is understood she will spend the day at her Balmoral holiday home. Buckingham Palace has confirmed that it will be \"business as usual\" for the 89-year-old monarch as she passes the record held by Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Victoria reigned for 23,226 days, 16 hours and 23 minutes – or 63 years and seven months – a British record which has lasted for more than a century. She was also at Balmoral on September 23, 1896 when she passed King George III’s record to become longest-reigning monarch. Then there was an outburst of national rejoicing with church bells ringing out to mark the moment and a chain of bonfires lit on the hills above Balmoral. Royal historian Hugo Vickers said: \"I rather think we might find similar spontaneous celebrations take place in September as well. \"It really is a momentous achievement to have reigned for that long and it’s something that should be marked. \"Most people have lived their whole lives in her reign and I think we are jolly lucky to have her. She has given stability in a fast changing world and is highly respected not just in Britain, but around the world. \"She is 89 and is still firing on all ­cylinders. There has been no slowing down at all with royal duties. She is remarkable.\" Tower of London chiefs announced last week it will be hosting a special event to mark the occasion. A series of images and animations featuring the letter Q will be projected onto the Tower for seven days from September 9. And in Windsor a 6.3km trail called the Queen’s Walkway, marked by 63 plaques to mark her 63-year reign, will open on September 9. The Queen was only 25 when she came to the throne. She was on safari in Kenya with Prince Philip, her husband of five years, when her father George VI died. She is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the age of 90 in January.\n",

            "Paragraph: Some festivals are about music some are about food or culture some are about just blowing off some steam built up at work or while studying. The holy grail though tends to be the ones aiming for a deeper experience, that reject the isolation of modern society and cherish togetherness. They're easy to scoff at, but while cynics are sat at their desks mocking people trying to \"find themselves\", thousands are having legitimately moving and profound experiences that might actually make them reassess how they choose to live their everyday life. Here we round up some global options when it comes to festivals you really have to commit to: BOOM – Portugal Taking place every two years beside a lake, BOOM celebrates the full moon with a psychedelic maelstrom of events encouraging people to converge and experience an alternative reality. All styles of music can be found but the emphasis is on the electronic, along with talks, group meditation and film screenings. It claims to be \"an autonomous zone of cognitive liberty\" and therefore is completely free from corporate sponsorship and logos. Meadows in the Mountains – Bulgaria Situated in the Rhodope Mountains, this festival is not interested in A-list line-ups but rather providing a means for escapism, with attendees revelling in the wildlife and fauna that covers the site and erecting stages, timber shacks and art installations out wood sustainably sourced from the surrounding forests. Also, it throws a pool party for everyone the day after the festival ends. Burning Man - Black Rock Desert The mecca of transformational festivals. You already know the main details, so here's an anecdote that perfectly sums it up: \"[My friend] decided to wander out onto the playa one night for a little alone time. After a while of walking around in the dark she comes upon what looks like this portable toilet out in the middle of nowhere. She thinks to herself, \"I could pee right now,\" walks over to the porta potty and opens the door. Only it's not a toilet. Instead there's a guy standing behind a wooden bar top with shelves of liquor behind him. He smiles at her and says, \"Welcome to the smallest bar in the world, what you like?\" After the initial shock wore off, she steps inside and orders a shot of whiskey. She stayed there for a while, had a couple of drinks, thanked the bartender and then walked back to her camp.\"AfrikaBurn - Tankwa Karoo Electric Forest - Rothbury, Michigan It's hard to think of a festival more picturesque than this one, which takes place in a dense forest that is lit with neon so as to give it an otherworldly look. The emphasis here is on art, with the tall trees being utilised to create some stunning installations and nooks, but there is also a packed DJ line-up each year and an enormous stage. AfrikaBurn - Tankwa Karoo This is not so much a festival as a temporary city. With community building, decommodification, creativity, self-reliance and radical self-expression as its core values, AfrikaBurn is a vast in scale, week-long experience involving a ton of performances. This year's theme is simply 'play'. Envision - Costa Rica If the lush rainforest of Uvita isn't enough for you, at sunset the tropical beach of Playa Hermosa opens at this festival, which is all about exploring our fundamental connection with nature. Art, spirituality, yoga, music, dance, performance, education and sustainability are the cornerstones of Envision, which is filled with temples and healing sanctuaries. Nowhere – Spain Finally, we come to the appropriately named Nowhere. Surrounded by rocky mountains in the scorched Spanish desert, this festival is so intense it's website comes with not only a survival guide but an 'emotional survival guide'.\n",

            "Paragraph: Mike Greenberg and Bruce Bowen react to the prices of tickets for Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. (1:12) The deciding game of the Western Conference championship is, not surprisingly, a very hot ticket. In fact, according to ticketing search engine TiqIQ, Monday night's game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Golden State Warriors has the second-highest list prices for an NBA Game 7 in the past five years ($960 per ticket). The only Game 7 to top Monday night's matchup in Oakland was the 2013 NBA Finals Game 7 between the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs ($1,346 per ticket). The Warriors put the few remaining tickets on sale Sunday night, with prices ranging from $230 to $2,150. They sold out in less than five minutes. At $960 a ticket, Monday night's game to determine the Western Conference champion boasts the second-highest list prices for an NBA Game 7 in the past five years, topped only by the 2013 NBA Finals, according to ticketing search engine TiqIQ. Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Those prices did not include any floor seats, which were sold out. But someone did go to the Warriors' resale site, run by Ticketmaster, and purchased two floor seats for $29,000 each. A spokesman for StubHub, which has appealed a federal judge's decision to dismiss its lawsuit against the Warriors and Ticketmaster, said its average sold ticket for the game was $824, with the cheapest seat at $359. StubHub has accused the team and Ticketmaster of conspiring to control both the primary and secondary ticket markets. Warriors officials have said that having Ticketmaster control both the primary and resale markets helps to make sure tickets are authentic. Warriors spokesperson Lisa Goodwin said the team had to turn away 80 fans for Game 5 at Oracle Arena on Thursday night because the tickets scanned as fraudulent.\n",

            "Paragraph: Walt Disney may no longer be with us, but he's left behind a legacy of films that have ultimately been with most of us since the time we were born. For as long as I can remember, Disney films have been a major part of my life. Growing up, I constantly watched the classics with my family. Now, I find myself venturing off into some of Disney's newer films. But regardless of the year they are released, almost every Disney film has one thing in common – the main character almost never has a mother. But why? Think about it! Cinderella? No mom. The Little Mermaid? No mom. Pocahontas? No mom.  Now some skeptics might point out that there are also a lot of characters who don't have any parents at all – like in Aladdin. But even in those films, there are side characters who have a father and no mother. Recall Jasmine's dad the Sultan? No wifey. Well if you've been trying to think of a reason behind this common plot structure, look no further. Because longtime Disney producer Don Hahn recently offered two very insightful theories behind Walt's method. And one theory behind it is quite sad! Don explained that the lack of parents in the films is just an easy way to allow the main characters to grow up. And let's face it – most Disney movies are about growing up.  \"One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and Disney films are about growing up\" says Hahn. \"Bambi's mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It's a story shorthand.\" Hahn went on to explain that this isn't a method Disney created himself, but one that he borrowed from many of the fairy tales his movies were based on.  But that's not the only possible reason for the lack of motherhood in his movies. Hahn explained that the lack of mothers in his films might have been a result of something that happened to Walt and his family. Something tragic that involved his mother...\n",

            "Paragraph: American drivers waste more time on the road You’re wasting more hours of your life sitting in traffic than ever before — and that’s not going to improve anytime soon. In 95 of the 100 largest cities in America, traffic congestion worsened from 2013 to 2014, according to a study from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, a research institute that develops solutions for transportation problems, released this month that’s compared to worsening traffic conditions in just 61 of the 100 cities from 2012 to 2013. \"The national congestion recession is over,\" the study authors conclude. Data for the study came from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the individual states, and the study methodology is described in detail here. This is thanks in large part to the fact that the U.S. economy has added more than 9 million jobs since the recession began, which means more people are now commuting to work. The unemployment rate was just 5.3% in July compared to 7.3% at the end of 2008. The congestion problem isn’t going anywhere anytime soon either: A report by the U.S. Travel Association found that commuters on many cities highways will soon experience Labor Day-like gridlock — Labor Day is typically one of the busiest travel days of the year — on the average day of the week. Some already are: \"Within many cities, already almost every day is like Labor Day,\" says Erik Hansen, who managed the study, referencing the summer holiday that traditionally generates the nation’s worst traffic jams. Millions of Americans waste more hours of their lives in traffic than they did three decades ago: Those traveling during peak travel hours will spend an average of 42 extra hours each year on the road (up from 18 in 1982) thanks to traffic, the Texas A&M Transportation Institute report revealed. That’s 6.9 billion hours for commuters on the whole — \"more than the time it would take to drive to Pluto and back, if there was a road,\" the authors note. What’s more, in cities with more than one million people, commuters experienced an average of 63 hours of extra travel time each year. And in some cities, that’s even worse. Here are the 10 cities in which residents waste the most hours of their lives sitting in traffic: 1. Washington, D.C. Commuters in our nation’s capital spend an average of 82 hours extra a year on the road thanks to traffic gridlock, making this the most congested city in America. This extra drive time costs the average auto commuter $1,834 per year (this number was calculated using a combination of the value of the travel delay — estimated at $17.67 per hour per person — and the average cost of gas in the state). 2. Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim The L.A. area comes in a close second when it comes to traffic congestion: Residents there spend an extra 80 hours a year in the car and $1,711 thanks to clogged roadways. 3. San Francisco and Oakland Auto commuters in the Bay Area are wasting an extra 78 hours of their year in traffic — and that’s costing them $1,675. That may make working for some of the more high-profile tech companies (ahem, Facebook and Google) in the area even more appealing, as many provide you with swanky buses to get to and from the office. 4. New York and Newark While the New York metro area ranks No. 4 in terms of the extra hours per year spent commuting (74), it ranks No. 2 in terms of what that costs residents ($1739). 5. San Jose, Calif. Though it’s not an exceptionally large city, it has outsized traffic congestion: Commuters here waste 67 hours in traffic at a cost of $1,422 per commuter each year. It’s one of only two cities in the top 10 that has fewer than three million residents. 6. Boston As anyone who’s sat (and sat) on I-90 or I-93 knows, it’s slow moving in Boston. Indeed, Bostonians waste 64 hours a year in traffic gridlock at a cost of $1,388. 7. Seattle In rainy Seattle, commuters who travel during peak times are forced to spend an extra $1,491 a year (in extra gas costs and the cost of lost time) thanks to gridlock as well as 63 additional hours in the car. 8. Chicago Residents of the Windy City spend an average of 61 extra hours in the car each year at a cost of $1,445. 9. Houston Houston ties with Chicago in terms of the number of wasted commuter hours each year (61), though residents there spend a little more in terms of gas costs and the costs of their lost time than in Chicago ($1,490 vs. $1,445) because of it. 10. Riverside and San Bernardino This is the fourth metro area in California to make this list, and one of only two cities with fewer than three million residents to make it (the other was San Jose). Commuters here waste 57 hours a year and spend $1,316, thanks to traffic gridlock.\n",

            "Paragraph: Everyone wants a Charizard. Everyone. He’s a fire-breathing lizard dragon and is a BAMF and his old holographic card was the holy grail of all booster packs back in the day. Now, in Nintendo and Niantic’s Pokémon Go, no doubt people are vying to nab or evolve their Charmanders and Squirtles into Charizards and Blastoises. (Nobody wants a Venosaur.) But unlike in the Game Boy games, in which players could level-grind their starter until the little pipsqueak evolves into a ferocious monster, Pokémon Go is about hunting for more Pokémon of the same type and transferring them for Candy. That sucks because that means your low-level Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur (or Pikachu) can’t evolve unless you find more of them, and that’s hard to begin with. But there are other ways. You’re just not going to like it. All About Eggs At various Pokéstops, you may have picked up unhatched Pokémon Eggs. Don’t make them into omelettes. Instead, put them in Incubators. In your Items menu, scroll to the bottom until you see available Incubators. Everyone has an incubator they can use an infinite amount of times, but you can pick up additional Incubators that break after several uses, often three. To put an Egg in an Incubator, select \"Pokémon\" from the menu and you’ll see an \"Eggs\" tab at the top. Pick an Egg, then press \"Start Incubation.\" If you have an available Incubator, put them in that. To unhatch an Egg, you have to walk. A lot. Types of Eggs, Measured by Kilometers If you’re from the U.S., get friendly with the metric system. To unhatch an Egg, you’ll have to walk a predetermined amount of distance. There are, so far, three types of Pokémon Eggs: Eggs that hatch at 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km. Most people are trying to hatch 5 km and 10 km Eggs — the Pokémon in those Eggs are the rarest. But if you want a Charizard, you’ll have to hatch those 2 km Eggs. Why? Because it’s in the 2 km Eggs that you can find more starter Pokemon. I told you you weren’t going to like this answer. Charts! On Reddit (and credited to Pokémon fan portal, Serebeii.net, users have created a chart showing which Pokémon Eggs hatch which Pokémon species. As you can see, the starters you want like Charmander are attainable by hatching 2 km Eggs. This is straight up gambling. There’s a chance that you’ll march all these miles — I’m sorry, kilometers — only to hatch your hundredth Rattata, and that would really blow (though you’ll probably make a lot of new friends. But when you do hatch that Squirtle, you can either keep it or send it — if it has a very low CP (\"Combat Power\") — to the Professor. You’ll get a Pokémon Candy — a Charmander Candy, a Squirtle Candy, a Pikachu Candy, etc. — and if you accumulate enough, you can evolve them. It’s grinding at its worst, but how much do you want that Charizard? There Is Another Way ... There have been a few flimsy reports of wild Charizards and the like, such as in the case of a beta tester finding one during the game’s pre-release. But now, the best way to find a wild evolved starter is to explore, particularly where wild starters in their earlier forms tend to frequent. Squirtles, like other water-type Pokémon, can be found in lakes, rivers, and other sea areas, whereas Bulbasaurs tend to frequent in grassy parks. Let me know where you find a Charmander, though. I’m still trying to figure that little bastard out. Because I really want a Charizard. I’ll go anywhere. Even the Westboro Baptist Church. Photos via Reddit\n",

            "Paragraph: Homeless Man Turns His Life Around With His Last $250. Earns $892,329 In A Single Month and Buys Himself a Ferrari! Melbourne - Life has been less than kind to Isaac Walker, pictured above on the streets of Melbourne. A former radio announcer, he had tragically lost his wife at the young age of 35, he spiraled into depression and lost his job. The bills kept piling, and he just couldn't get ahead. Before long he was evicted from his home. But now thanks to this simple options trading platform, Isaac's life is turning around... It all turned around when Isaac clicked on an advertisement he saw while browsing the internet at the unemployment office. \"I came across this new online stock trading platform that promised $6,000 worth of profits in three weeks. Yeah, right. I was extremely skeptical, but, I was in a really dark place and had nothing to lose at that point. I had around $320 left in my bank account and decided to deposit the $250 to join. I had to try it, I still had hope of a brighter future.\" Isaac had found Magnum Options and it would change his life for the better. \"I was just hanging out in the shelter looking for something to do when I came across this blueprint. At first I watched the video and I still felt skeptical after seeing so many people earn thousands and even hundreds of thousands trading online, but once I made my deposits, I went through the written material and the experience was incredible! I didn't expect much but from the very start it turned out to be great fun! The courses were easy to get through and I made about $600 in my first week. As promised, there weren't any commission fees and I've been getting paid at the end of each week!\" It was only two weeks ago when Isaac had just $320 in his bank account, literally. After his first week on the platform, he decided to put his earnings back into the platform and keep earning. He didn't want to stop! \"The courses made it really easy to make trades. The system literally tells you what to do! In the first two weeks I ended up depositing around $800 and made over $3,000. This was a no-brainer. My chance at a new life was appearing right before my eyes.\" Isaac then proceeded to tell us about his fourth week trading Magnum Options. He told us about the process. We could tell he was a changed man. After disclosing that he had earned over $30,000 in the last four weeks, he showed us a picture of his bank statement. We couldn't believe it either, but after noticing Isaac's appearance, Isaac really looked like a new man. He had a clean haircut, new clothes, a simple car, and even a new phone. \"It's important for me to have a good smartphone. I check my trades daily and make sure that I'm earning money every day. Most of the time I'm barely working! I'm grateful for Magnum Options, it's really changed my life!\". Isaac's story is an incredible one. We checked back in with him in his sixth week trading Magnum Options and we couldn't really believe his claims. Isaac said that he had hit the jackpot, literally, after Magnum Options told him to make a series of trades. In his sixth week trading, Isaac earned a cool $892,329. \"I jumped up and started cheering! It must've been quite a sight. Here I was, screaming and cheering and dancing around the shelter, haha.. they thought I'd lost everything! But it was the exact opposite!\" But his joy quickly turned into skepticism. \"How is this possible, this can't be right?! That's what I thought. So I calmed down, and requested a payout. And then I waited.\" Then, two days later, having almost forgotten about it, he checked his bank account, \"and then I read it was real. Nearly a million Australian dollars in my bank account, I nearly had a heart attack! Haha! Since I was a little kid I always had dreams of owning my own Ferrari, it was all I ever wanted, my room was plastered with photos of red Ferraris. So after I saw almost 900K in my bank account and my Magnum Options account growing ever still I said \"Screw it! I'm buying one! When I pulled up to my local hotel in my brand new Ferrari 488 convertible my buddies jaws hit the floor!\" And while he may be one of the bigger winners of this new trading platforms grand opening promotion, Isaac certainly isn't the only one to cash out on Magnum Options's new trading platform. Since the promotion began this February, over 738 new traders all over the world have won money from just an easy $250 deposit. However, it appears that the \"New Trader Promotion\" will be soon ending as the company has already paid out over $2,680,000 in total earnings this last month. At least, that’s the opinion of noted industry expert Alan Silver, \"This is something you often see with online trading platforms, Silver says. \"They start off with ridiculous promotions and once they have enough traders, they tone it down and it becomes harder to make a profit. The same is happening at Magnum Options. They might continue this for a few more weeks, maybe a few months tops, but then it’s over.\" CNN's reporter Jane Fayerman also tried her hand at the platform but sadly only walked away with $485 profit on her series of trades - \"you can't always win as big as Isaac sadly!\" *As promised, here is the link to access the special offer (also works on mobile devices).

            "Paragraph: Liquor is marketed as magic. If you drink Disaronno on the rocks, goes the ad, you'll instantly feel like that hot bartender, or that hot lady at the bar. Whichever one, you'll feel hot, is the point. Turns out the ads don't stop there. A new study from the market research firm Affinnova suggests that liquor bottles also act as potent billboards, able to alter our conception of a brand's \"personality.\" The study split 500 U.S.-based vodka drinkers into two equal groups. Half judged the personalities of vodkas based on the brand's name, and half based on its bottle. In the mix were Absolut, Belvedere, Smirnoff, Ketel One, Skyy (using a limited run bottle), Tito’s, Stolichnaya, Svedka, Grey Goose, Ciroc, Pinnacle and New Amsterdam. The two groups ranked each brand in categories like \"sexy,\" \"genuine,\" \"fun\" and \"celebratory.\" The respondents dealing with brand name alone deemed Absolut the most \"sexy\" -- not surprising, considering the sophisticated ad war the Swedish company has waged for decades. But respondents looking at its bottle -- which, while iconic, is also relatively squat and covered in text -- ranked the brand sixth sexiest, out of twelve. The winner of this sexiness contest? Skyy, based on its stark cobalt blue bottle. The brand on the left is not as sexy. In a statement, Affinnova explained the gap in the two assessments on complacency on the part of older brands. Established brands state their case to the public before said public is pushed up against a bar, making an order. \"Up and coming\" companies (Affinnova cites Belvedere and Pinnacle), however, are more likely to try a last-minute pitch from the shelf. And apparently they're better at it. Absolut's bottle lost the titles liquor marketers tend to chase -- \"fun,\" \"celebratory,\" \"sexy.\" Meanwhile, the mansion on the Belvedere bottle impressed respondents, who called the imaginary house \"stately, regal and classy,\" according to the study, and gave the brand the title of most \"intelligent.\" Another winning visual element, according to the study? The word \"imported,\" which most respondents singled out as appealing. For domestic brands, there's really no way around this one. It could be why Tito's, generally regarded as a solid American vodka, scored last in all but two personality categories. Of course, the study's arbitrary winners and losers only reinforce what consumers should know from decades of performing miserably at vodka taste tests: we're poor judges of our most popular spirit. Maybe we should drink with blindfolds on?\n",

            "Paragraph: Rocker Ted Nugent just made big bucks to not show up somewhere. The town of Longview, Texas paid Nugent $16,000 to not appear at the town's Fourth of July Festival. According to KLTV, a city spokesman said Nugent was \"not the right feel for this kind of community event.\" The city had reached a verbal agreement with Nugent, scheduling the rocker as the headliner who would play inside the Maude Cobb Convention and Activity Center during the town's Independence Day celebration. To break that agreement, the town paid Nugent half of his guaranteed performance fee of $32,000 from Maude Cobb's annual budget. The move comes amid criticism of comments Nugent made about President Barack Obama in January 2014, calling him a \"subhuman mongrel.\" Nugent, who campaigned with Texas Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott amid the controversy, apologized for those comments in February. Abbott said he was moving on from the controversy over Nugent in late February, but his ties to the rocker remain a prominent talking point of both sides of the governor's race. Abbott's rival, Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis (D), called the Attorney General's embrace of Nugent an \"insult,\" while former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin (R) cited the rocker in her endorsement of Abbott. \"If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!\" Palin wrote on her Facebook page. The situation with Longview is not unique. Nugent was removed from a concert lineup at a prominent military base in 2012 after saying he would be \"dead or in jail by this time next year\" if Obama were re-elected that year.\n",

            "Paragraph: When a student claims to need a certain grade, she is operating under the assumption that grades are doled out arbitrarily—the result of a professor’s whim and mood. DGLimages/Thinkstock M any American colleges and universities convened classes this week, and as students take tours of all the any American colleges and universities convened classes this week, and as students take tours of all the safe spaces and water parks (or, if they’re in Texas, as they burnish their firearm collections ), they are likely feeling more pressure than ever to maintain high GPAs. Whether due to financial aid requirements, sports scholarships, naked ambition, or just plain fear of their parents, many students care deeply about their grades This leads thousands of them, every semester, at every postsecondary institution in this great land, to utter one fateful plea to the person on the other side of the lectern. They make this plea to help them achieve their goals, yet it is one of the most ill-advised things any student can do. It usually arrives via email at a strange hour of the night. It goes like this: \"Professor, I NEED an A in this class.\" All right, I admit: I’m indulging in the time-honored rhetorical device of hyperbole. Not all professors get this all the time. Sometimes the grade students \"need\" is a B or a C; on rare occasions, they’ll send a plaintive appeal for a D-minus. But seriously, anyone who has taught a college class has probably come across a version of the \"need-a-grade.\" Alas, no peer-reviewed article exists in the Journal of Transcript-Based Pedagogical Outcomes and Definitive Assessment Precis Rankings on this demand’s exact frequency, so you will have to make do with this veritable shitstorm of anecdotal evidence that occurred on my extremely scientific Twitter feed within a single hour of this meek inquiry: \"Professors and professor-adjacent, show of hands: Has a student ever told you they \"need\" a certain grade? What did you do?\" (Responses ran the entire spectrum from extreme compassion to \" out of office reply .\") Yes, there’s a lot of need in the college classroom these days. And it needs to stop. Not only because it’s disrespectful, grating, and woefully ignorant of the way college assessment works, but, more importantly, because the deluge of \"need\" obscures some actual needs. When a student claims to need a certain grade, she is operating under the assumption that grades are doled out arbitrarily—the result of a professor’s whim and mood. This stands in stark contrast to reality, which is that in an ever-more-tortured aim at transparency and fairness —even in so-called \"subjective\" disciplines like the humanities—a professor’s grading system often comes courtesy of multiple tortured rubrics. Those rubrics are themselves tied to ever-more-intransigent \" learning outcomes ,\" resulting in an intricate web of math and check marks, all of which are explained in detail on pages 450-499 of the 900-page syllabus Wait, are those kegstands recreational, or a cry for help? Assessment metrics are meticulously thought-out these days. They’re specifically designed to eliminate extraneous subjectivity. The assumption that they can be chucked on the basis of a particularly forceful series of emails is enough to make an overworked professor scream, Oh, you NEED an A, do you? I didn’t REALIZE! I was just giving you a B-minus for fun! MY MISTAKE!!!!! and then break down in sobs and then retrench and outright refuse to budge on the grade. This would defeat the initial purpose of the plea. Claiming to need a certain grade conveniently ignores the fact that the grade is already likely the highest it can possibly be whilst still maintaining even the hint of professorial integrity, to keep up with the inflationary Joneses and stave off complaints. This sort of \"need\" language also moves the onus for meeting that need from the person earning the grade to the person assessing it. This transfer of power takes away the very agency and self-sufficiency students are allegedly attending college to gain. ( For now .) Most importantly, claiming to need a grade often gets in the way of legitimate professorial help. The pressure students are under to keep their grades up is real, and students deserve the benefit of the doubt, because so many are legitimately struggling . And so, any professor who gets a \"need-an-A\" message must immediately add to their substantial workload the job of crisis detective: Is Johnny’s grade bad because he’s trying his best and still underperforming? Or because he blew off a bunch of assignments and stopped coming to class? Wait, did he stop coming to class because of a crisis at home—or because he’s too busy doing kegstands with his bros at Sigma Kappa Douche? Wait, are those kegstands recreational, or a cry for help? working long hours; There are innumerable real problems that get in the way of student success: mental health struggles ; relatives with health issues; children PTSD due to military service or other causes. Students dealing with these problems deserve compassion. But it’s difficult for professors to make these kinds of calls when every other Johnny \"needs\" a certain grade and acts like it’s a matter of life and death. Believe it or not, if a student wants to get a higher grade, there are things she can do that work better than saying But I NEED a C-minus or I’ll lose my sportsball eligibility! For the student who actually is working but underperforming—i.e. a student who should be her professor’s top priority—the second an assignment comes back with a less-than-optimal letter on it, that student should show up at office hours. Not to demand a better grade, but to go over that assignment in detail and make a work plan for future study or tutoring. For those who miss class but have legitimate, non-kegstand-related issues, the professor can direct them to the correct support office (advising, disability, counseling), and make the appropriate arrangement to get extensions, incompletes, or withdrawals, all of which are preferable to a sub-optimal grade.\n",

The Florida teen accused of pretending to be a doctor and stealing money from an 86-year-old patient faces new charges in Virginia. Love-Robinson was arrested Friday, Sept. 9, 2016 and charged with identity theft and other fraud offenses after he attempted to purchase a Jaguar at a car dealership, Stafford County Sheriff’s officials say. (Photo: Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department / AP file photo) Stafford, Va. — A Florida teenager accused of pretending to be a doctor and stealing money from an 86-year-old patient faces new charges in Virginia after authorities say he fraudulently tried to buy a luxury car. Malachi Love-Robinson was arrested Friday and charged with identity theft and other fraud offenses after he attempted to purchase a Jaguar at a car dealership, Stafford County Sheriff’s officials say. They said employees at Kargar Motors Car Dealership became suspicious when Love-Robinson applied for a car loan with an elderly woman as the co-signer on the loan. The employees called the sheriff’s office after looking up Love-Robinson’s name in an internet search. Deputies came to the car dealership and spoke with Love-Robinson, who said he came to Virginia to buy a car for himself and another for his godmother. The woman, who was not identified, later told deputies that she had not given Love-Robinson permission to be listed as a co-signer on the loan. She also told police she was unaware of recent purchases made on her credit card for two iPads. The sheriff’s office says deputies seized the iPads when they arrested Love-Robinson. Sheriff’s officials say they are still investigating, and Love-Robinson is being held in the Rappahannock Regional Jail. Love-Robinson was arrested in February after law enforcement officials in Florida said he was practicing medicine without a license. Authorities in Palm Beach County said Love-Robinson was illegally operating a medical practice — complete with an office, a lab coat and stethoscope — but had no license to do so. In one instance, they said he went to a woman’s house five times after she contacted him online to treat her for stomach pains. He told her she suffered from arthritis and sold her vitamins, charging her $3,494 that she paid by check. Love-Robinson has denied the charges, saying he never said he was a medical doctor. He claims to have a doctorate from the Universal Life Church, which sells them online for $29.95. His trial on charges of practicing medicine without a license has been delayed until November while his attorney considers a possible insanity defense, according to media reports.\n",

            "Paragraph: It's been years since Chris Crocker first blasted to Internet fame for his infamous \"Leave Britney Alone\" YouTube video -- and a lot has changed since then. When he's not busy starring in a new documentary or out taking drives with RuPaul, Crocker has apparently been readying himself for a new venture: becoming the face of American Apparel's latest clothing campaign. \"I find my gig with American Apparel to be a perfect fit. I relate with their subversiveness and boundary pushing. It only makes sense, and it's an honor,\" said Crocker in a statement to The Huffington Post. \"I wanted to do it because besides it being an honor, it's just a part of my whole re-branding process as a 25-year-old embarking on a relaunch in my career and nothing could be more perfect.\" American Apparel also shared Crocker's enthusiasm for his participation in the campaign: \"After watching Chris's videos and the documentary we just found ourselves enjoying his spirit and look. We ended up reaching out to do a quick shoot and these photos are the result. The response has been great and we may do even more experimental photos.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: The Man Who Pays His Way: Are all-female flight crews anything more than symbolic? Passengers aboard easyJet flight 8275 from Gatwick to Madrid on Wednesday encountered two surprises. The first: they were kept waiting on the ground for nearly two hours because of a strike by French air-traffic controllers. The second: all six crew members on the Airbus A320 were women. The arithmetic shows this to be a rare event. While many cabin crew are female, men outnumber women by around 16 to one on the flight deck.  When I checked on the flight-deck gender split three months ago with all the leading airlines serving UK passengers, a remarkably consistent pattern emerged: at British Airways, easyJet, Monarch and Ryanair, just 6 per cent of crew are female. Flybe performs slightly better than the norm; 7.5 per cent of the airline’s pilots are female, while just 3 per cent of Thomson’s pilots are women. All other things being equal, only one flight in about 300 to and from the UK is flown by two women; 17 have have one male and one female pilot; and the remaining 282 are two-man operations. But not all other things are equal, because the proportion of captains who are female is even smaller than that 6 per cent. At Thomas Cook Airlines, for example, 8 per cent of first officers — junior pilots — are female, but among captains, the proportion of women falls to below 2 per cent. Worldwide, the figures are even worse, with only 3 per cent of pilots worldwide female — raising the odds of a two-woman flight crew to a shocking one in 1,000 Pilots were warned about the French strike by a NOTAM — a NOtice To AirMen, which most of the time is well aimed.  As the captain of that easyJet flight said, \"It is hard to think of another high profile profession where women are so under-represented.\" She is Kate McWilliams, at 27 years old also the world’s youngest female commercial captain. The flight on International Women’s Day was more than just a gesture: easyJet has set an ambitious target of increasing the proportion of its female pilots aiming for 20 per cent of new-intake pilots by 2020. The airline has named an Airbus A320 jet after the pioneering female aviator, Amy Johnson, and that was the aircraft used for the pioneering Gatwick-Madrid flight. It wasn’t the first time an airline has highlighted the high-altitude gender gap; a year ago, Royal Brunei Airlines operated its first all-female-pilot service, with a twist of irony to Saudi Arabia — where conservative clerics ban women from driving.  Given the hostile attitude to homosexuality in the Sultanate, I fear we may be waiting rather longer for the Bruneian carrier to dispatch a flight with openly gay pilots. Across at easyJet’s giant rival, Ryanair, one female pilot has become an online celebrity as well as a role model: Maria Pettersson, from Gothenburg, combines her work as a first office with a travel and lifestyle blog. Talking of lifestyle: could one reason for the gender imbalance be the uncertain and disruptive schedule that pilots have to handle? I don’t believe so, because there are plenty of female cabin crew who cope with equally onerous rosters. Civil Aviation Authority flight-deck rules that apply only to women pilots don’t help. Pregnant women can fly as a passenger on easyJet up to the 35th week of gestation, but under CAA regulations the limit is 26 weeks. \"After this point, the certificate shall be suspended,\" instructs the authority, adding a provision that makes having a baby sound like an affliction: \"The suspension shall be lifted after full recovery following the end of the pregnancy.\" To see how the rails compare with the skies, I asked Eurostar how many of its train drivers are female. Just two out of 62, which means that men outnumber women by 30 to one. Gender stereotyping in transport seems deeply ingrained — as do the attitudes of some men. When I first wrote about the easyJet initiative to recruit more female pilots, one reader added this unhelpful comment: \"I wonder if they'd give my mother-in-law a job. Can't be much difference between flying a broomstick and flying a plane.\"\n",

A 14-minute video featuring an unusual cluster of lights above a border control post in Tijuana, Mexico was featured on several news outlets Friday as well as Instagram before allegedly disappearing without any explanation. In the video of the incident, some members of the border staff can be seen temporarily abandoning their posts, as cars crossing the border between the U.S. and Mexico stop to view the lights and honk their horns.

            "Paragraph: How has an Aussie act entered 2015's EUROVISION competition? It's the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song contest and the organisers have added a surprising wildcard in the form of Australia - a country not traditionally in Europe. Or factually. Or even metaphorically. But the contest has had a cult following Down Under (think how much we liked Neighbours and Prisoner Cell Block H) for many years and has been given a one-off invitation this year. An Australian jury panel will submit the Australian vote and Australia may well be televoting along with other European countries. This seems plausible as Australia has run its own online vote (which has no bearing on the competition) since 2010. And one of the Aussies' more successful musical exports (apart from Nick Cave, Kylie and INXS) is of course Bjorn Again - the wildly successful parody act which pays tribute to Eurovision's most famous winner, Abba. Here's their version of Waterloo (which won Eurovision for the Swedes in 1974). Check out those bell-bottoms. Those judo outfits. That hair! When is it on? The 2015 Song Contest takes place this Saturday with Graham Norton supplying his usual commentary. It is set to air on BBC One and BBC Radio 2 at 8pm. If Australians want to watch the contest live, it will be aired by Australian broadcaster SBS at 5am Sunday morning Australian Eastern Standard Time, and repeated later at 7.30pm Sunday night. Where is it being held? After Austria's Conchita Wurst won last year, the 2015 Eurovison Song Contest will travel to her home country. The show will come live from the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna. So what's the deal? The bookies have made X Factor Australia judge Guy Sebastian one of the favourites to win in Vienna. The Malaysian-born singer-songwriter was the first winner of Australian Idol in 2003, and signalled his intent by penning a whole slew of potential songs in just three days. The one that made the cut is an jaunty R&B jam called Tonight Again which echoes Mark Ronson's recent global smash Uptown Funk. For those who may have woken up from a deep sleep, This is Uptown Funk: And the bookies odds are..? Sweden is the favourite to take this year's crown with Måns Zelmerlöw's track 'Heroes', being listed at 7/4 to win by William Hill. So what if Guy wins it for Australia? Now here's an interesting one. Traditionally the winning country is the host of next year's contest so if Australia takes the prize will the whole of Europe have to traipse over to Oz in a sea of sequins and glitter? No-one is sure. Organisers have said that Australia can't host the competition, but their broadcaster SBS could co-organise the event with another European country where the contest would take place. And will Australia be invited to defend their title? This hasn't been confirmed either but it's likely that they will be permitted an entry if the move is a hit with the viewers. It's an 'historic' step which will take the contest to a 'new global level' say the organisers. Michael Ebeid, managing director of broadcaster SBS, which airs the show in Australia, said: \"We are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for Australia to be represented on the world's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and are honoured that the European Broadcasting Union has supported us to achieve this ambition. \"SBS has been broadcasting Eurovision for over 30 years and we have seen how Australians' love of the song contest has grown during those years.\" Executive supervisor of the contest Jon Ola Sand who works for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: \"It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying 'let's celebrate this party together'.\" Alexander Wrabetz director general of host broadcasters ORF, said: \"The song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest TV entertainment event in the world. \"With the participation of Australia, together with our partners at the EBU and SBS, we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe, starting from the heart of Europe.\" Electro Velvet are the UK's entrant for this year's Eurovision Song Contest.\n",

            "Paragraph: Black Friday is nearly here, and it's time to be told which must-have products are worth trampling each other for this holiday season. Are you ready for the answer? Here it is: None. There are exactly zero Black Friday deals worth getting enough to hurt someone, or risk being hurt yourself. This is what Tickle-Me-Elmo thinks of the fact that your deranged, barbaric consumerism allowed your mind to go there even for a second: (via YouTube) While we're with Elmo on this one -- and you really should be too -- hordes of people around the nation must be at least a little less sure. They're preparing to camp out in frigid temperatures outside big box stores, waiting to join the crush of humanity as it flows through the aisles, carrying away the best deals on products that they never really needed in the first place. Black Friday can seem ridiculous, but it's no joke. Every year, seemingly unfathomable things happen on the day after Thanksgiving, including deaths and injuries. The first casualty of modern times came in 2008, when a New York Walmart worker was killed in a stampede of frenzied shoppers. Five years later, Walmart still hasn't paid a fine for its employee's death. In 2011, Black Friday shoppers ignored a collapsed comrade, leaving him to die as they rushed the store hunting for sales. A year later, would-be customers exchanged gunfire outside a store after a dispute over a parking spot. Two were wounded. If you think that's bad, it's only getting worse. This year, the deals are starting earlier than ever, with many stores opening their doors to the masses on Thanksgiving Day, thereby forcing workers and enabling shopping obsessed consumers to give up their holiday. Look, we understand the desire to get Christmas shopping out of the way as early and as cheaply as possible. But if you're considering taking part in Black Friday (or Thursday) this year, just ask yourself: Is the urge to buy things really so strong that you need to partake in a free-for-all that will undoubtedly end in tragedy for someone, somewhere this year?\n",

            "Paragraph: When was the last time you read the label, and how closely?  The ingredients list may reveal unexpected, and often unwanted, extra ingredients lurking in your favourite supermarket foods.    From pork fat in roast chicken bites to sugar containing traces of bones, these are the most alarming examples of when innocuous-soundings products contain very surprising additions.  BEEF OR PORK IN YOGHURT Many yoghurts, especially low-fat yoghurts such as Muller Light, contain gelatine.  Gelatine is of course made from skin, tendons, ligaments and bones of pigs and cows which are boiled in water, according to PETA. It is rich in collagen and commonly used as a gelling agent in desserts, dips, yogurts, sweets and marshmallows.  If you're Jewish, Muslim or vegetarian, you may want to read the label much more closely next time you go to pick up a yoghurt.  On its website, Muller says: 'We indicate if our products are suitable for vegetarians on the packaging. The following ranges include a good selection of vegetarian products: Müller Fruit Corner, Müller Crunch Corner, Müller Breakfast Corner, Müller Greek Style Yogurt Corner, Müller Rice, Little Stars fromage frais, Müllerlight Chocolate Fix desserts and Amoré.' BONES IN SUGAR As sugar isn't naturally white, some manufacturers use bone char to make it that colour - often referred to as 'natural carbon'. It is quite literally the charred bones of an animal. According to PETA, supermarket brands obtain their sugar from several different refineries, making it impossible to know whether it has been filtered with bone char.  SEAFOOD IN BANANAS Non-organic bananas are sprayed with a pesticide which may contain animal parts. According to Science Daily, the pesticide Chitosan, which fights bacteria and prevents bananas from over-ripening, is made from shrimp and crab shells.  PORK FAT IN CHICKEN BITES You would not expect to find pork fat in a packet of Asda roast chicken bites but it's there on the label - and if you're Jewish or Muslim, this could present a big problem. The pork flat is clearly listed on the ingredients list, however - which was not the case for a beef lasgane served up at restaurants owned by Whitbread. Just last week, the company was forced to apologise for using pork in its beef lasagne recipe without telling its customers. BEETLES IN RED SWEETS Red sweets or any other foods which are coloured with a natural red dye will more often than not contain animal products. Carmine, which is made from dead crushed up beetles, comes about when the insects are boiled with sodium carbonate or ammonia, which then produces the attractive, bright red dye.  ANCHOVIES IN WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE  It's often added to stews and a Bloody Mary to enliven them, but some Worcestershire sauces such as Lea & Perrins actually contain anchovies. The fish in the sauce gives it an umami flavour, which is what gives food a moreish savoury taste.  BEAVER IN ICE CREAM Some ice creams contain the ingredient 'castoreum' - which comes from a beaver's anal glands. It's most often found in natural vanilla ice creams and the ingredient is allowed to be called a 'natural flavouring'.  It's enough to put you off your raspberry ripple.  BEEF IN SAUSAGE CASSEROLE Some supermarket sausages, including cocktail sausages, are contained within beef casing and this is also the case with Tesco's sausage casserole. The pork-based dish contains beef as well, so steer clear if that puts you off. A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'We take great care to clearly label all our products to provide honest and helpful information so that customers can make an informed decision on what they wish to buy.'  HUMAN HAIR IN BREAD Some breads and pastries contain L-cysteine, an amino acid used in the baking industry as a dough conditioner and it's used to prolong the shelf life of many bread-based products. L-cysteine can be derived from human hair because it is the cheapest source of the acid.  WASPS IN FIGS There's a good chance that when you buy a fig, the fruit contains a dead wasp.  This happens when a wasp pollinates a fig and gets stuck inside the fruit and dies there. However, when you do bite into the fig, you won't be able to see the dead wasp contained within as an enzyme in the fruit converts the wasp into protein.  CHICKEN IN BEEF PASTE If you're buying beef paste, you'd probably expect the only meat to be found in the jar to be beef. But actually, the ingredients list of the Asda spread reveals that it is made up of 33 per cent minced chicken.  An Asda spokesman said: 'The ingredients in our products are carefully chosen to maximise quality, appearance and flavour, but everything is clearly labelled for our customers to make an informed choice.' \n",

            "Topic: Where the Next Crisis Will Come From\n",
            "Paragraph: Next year ends in a 7. If you’re superstitious or a little loose with statistics, that makes us due for another financial crisis. The biggest one-day stock drop in Wall Street history happened in 1987. The Asian crisis was in 1997. And the worst global meltdown since the Great Depression got rolling in 2007 with the failure of mortgage lenders Northern Rock in the U.K. and New Century Financial in the U.S. You can’t really mark the next crisis down on your calendar, of course. The point is that crackups come fairly regularly. And some of the prerequisites for the next one do seem to be falling into place. The International Monetary Fund may have gotten things about right in its annual Global Financial Stability Report, which was issued in October. It doesn’t sound an alarm but expresses concern. Short-term risks have actually abated, the IMF says, pointing to rebounding commodity prices, which help some key emerging markets, and the prospect of easier money in developed markets. But, it says, \"medium-term risks continue to build.\" It cites the unsettled political climate, which makes entrenched problems harder to tackle; some weak financial institutions in developed markets; and heavy corporate debts in emerging markets. Risks that aren’t acute can build for a while before triggering a crisis. What’s indisputable is that debt, the tinder of almost every financial conflagration, is growing rapidly. At 225 percent of world gross domestic product, combined public and private debt outside the financial sector \"is currently at an all-time high,\" the IMF says. Debt fuels growth but also makes borrowers brittle. Debtors keep owing money even if they lose the ability to repay. If they default, their lenders are damaged and sometimes default on their own obligations, and so the dominoes fall. The world’s banks are mostly stronger now than they were on the eve of the last financial crisis, but there are important exceptions. The stock of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest, has fallen 62 percent from its 2015 high, and Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has so far resisted an obvious solution to shore up the bank, namely raising money by issuing new shares, which would dilute the ownership of current shareholders. The German government, having inveighed against bailouts for southern European banks, is insisting it won’t reverse course now for its own bank. In Italy, meanwhile, troubled loans on banks’ books equal about one-quarter of the nation’s GDP. Even in the U.S., investors don’t appear to regard big banks as any safer now than they were before the last crisis, according to a paper issued by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Natasha Sarin, a Harvard graduate student. The stock prices of the big U.S. banks are uncomfortably low, Summers and Sarin say, which implies that their \"franchise value\" has been eroded. That suggests that in a crisis they might have a hard time paying off their debts by liquidating assets. Ultralow interest rates aren’t helping banks’ ability to withstand a crisis. They squeeze profits—which banks need to build up their safety cushion—by reducing the amount banks can earn on the loans they make. It’s not only the level of rates but also the small difference between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and the long-term rates at which they lend. Two regulations that take effect in 2018 will begin to pinch in 2017 as banks prepare to comply with them. One, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, strictly limits the amount of leverage that banks can use to make money. Another requires them to recognize expected loan losses more quickly. Although the rules should make banks safer, they could also further reduce their profits. If banks keep trying to thread the needle—scraping by without turning to shareholders for more capital—they could become even more vulnerable. Whatever the stresses on conventional banks, they probably pose less of a risk than the shadow banking system, says Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish, a unit of BNY Mellon. The \"design failure\" of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to reform Wall Street is that by raising the cost of operating a conventional bank, it pushed some money toward less regulated shadow banks, Reinhart says. The shadow banking system includes hedge funds, money-market mutual funds, and Wall Street securities lenders and borrowers. China may be the scariest source of risk on the horizon. Its growth rate has been driven by unsustainably rapid expansion of lending to businesses and households, says Bloomberg Intelligence Chief Asia Economist Tom Orlik. The government has signaled, through an editorial in the state-run press, that it wants the country to start deleveraging. \"So far it is not clear if words will be matched with deeds,\" Orlik wrote on Oct. 11. Chinese banks are \"the major risk, a potential detonator,\" says Samuel Malone, director of specialized modeling at Moody’s Analytics. He looked at the size, fragility, and interconnectedness of the world’s biggest banks and concluded that China’s Southeast Asian neighbors, particularly Singapore, are most directly exposed. China’s shadow banking system is huge and poorly understood, and the losses that it suffers could quickly be transmitted to conventional banks.\n",

            "Paragraph: Cheating sucks! This absolute favourite thing in the world apart from murders or robbery is as evil as any other violation. We all remember happy faces, exhilaration, and sheer elation when two folks mutually get into a relationship, but half of them get thrown in predicament, simply because of infinitely.  Why do you ask? Because some people just love to cheat and it can happen for multiple reasons - they found a better match, they just weren't loyal, the opportunity of something different, emotional incompatibility, intimacy, etc.  But sadly, despite cheating, most cheaters feel belaboured when caught.  But let's keep the mental rationale aside and see what science has to say about it. We’ve all heard the same, tired cliche about infidelity: \"Once a cheater, always a cheater.\" and now science is backing it. A recent study proves that cheating is not a one-time thing, and that person will probably cheat on you again. The venerable saying is backed in this journal titled \"The brain adapts to dishonesty\".  The study focused on the part of the brain called amygdala, which is the supplier of negative responses. It's a region that's associated with emotions and plays \"a key role in signalling, processing and assessing arousal.\" It further responds to an individual when they lie.  Each time a person is caught cheating, the response to their wrongdoing is reduced. \"We speculate that the blunted response to repeated acts of dishonesty may reflect a reduction in the emotional response to these decisions or to their affective assessment and saliency,\" the paper reads. It further stated that the brain rationalises with the cheating ways, and feels less guilty, responsible when caught. How convenient, right? \"When participants were dishonest for the benefit of someone else, dishonesty at a constant rate was observed,\" the study says. When a person engages in dishonesty purely for the benefit of another it may be perceived as morally acceptable. In all this, the person on the receiving end should always be open-minded -- open to options, positivity, optimism. Gliding in a pool of despair will drag them further into it, making it harder to cope.\n",

            "Paragraph: President Obama, shown in 2012, has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace during his last few years in office. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) President Obama President Obama commuted the sentences of 214 federal prisoners on Wednesday. At least 67 of them were serving life sentences, many of those for nonviolent drug crimes. The White House The White House points out that Obama has granted \"more commutations than the previous nine presidents combined and more commutations than any individual president in nearly a century.\" This is true, but it's also a slightly misleading statistic. When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely. A commutation \"reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction,\" When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely. A commutation \"reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction,\" according to the Justice Department A pardon, on the other hand, \"is an expression of the president’s forgiveness and ordinarily is granted in recognition of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence.\" In other words, as legal scholar Michael Walden of New York University In other words, as legal scholar Michael Walden of New York University once explained , a \"pardon wipes out the conviction while a commutation leaves the conviction intact but wipes out the punishment.\" Obama has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace in his last few years in office. But he's only issued 70 pardons so far, Obama has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace in his last few years in office. But he's only issued 70 pardons so far, according to the Justice Department . That's fewer pardons than any president going all the way back to William McKinley, the earliest president for which the Justice Department tracks clemency statistics. For a fuller picture of presidential clemency actions, it's best to compare the average number of pardons and commutations issued by each president per month of their presidencies. That way, you don't have to worry about different amounts of time in office skewing those numbers. Here's what that chart looks like for all pardons and commutations, including the latest batch announced by the Obama administration. At an average of seven pardons or commutations per month, Obama is now issuing clemency actions at a faster pace than any president since Jimmy Carter. But those numbers are still well under historic norms for most of the 20th century. Woodrow Wilson granted pardons and commutations at a rate of nearly 30 per month. Herbert Hoover issued an average of 25 per month. But the clemency picture under Obama is now very different than it was just two years ago, before Obama's clemency work started in earnest. Back then, he was issuing pardons and commutations at a slower rate than any president of the past century. The latest commutations are welcome news for criminal justice reform groups, such as The latest commutations are welcome news for criminal justice reform groups, such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums , which are working to reduce overall prison populations. But absent much larger commutation efforts on a massive scale, a single president's efforts aren't likely to make a huge dent in the federal prison population. Obama's 562 commutations and 70 pardons represent approximately one-third of 1 percent of the total federal prison population of 205,000 inmates — to say nothing of the more than 1.3 million people currently held in state prisons. However, the Obama administration promises its clemency efforts will continue. \"Our work is far from finished,\" White House Counsel Neil Eggleston However, the Obama administration promises its clemency efforts will continue. \"Our work is far from finished,\" White House Counsel Neil Eggleston wrote today . \"I expect the president will continue to grant clemency in a historic and inspiring fashion.\"\n",

The Atlanta airport had 96 million passengers in 2014, compared to 86 million who passed through Beijing last year, according to the group that monitors worldwide airport traffic. Atlanta's margin over the second-place airport decreased from a 10.7 million spread in 2013, but traffic at the airport itself went up from 94.4 million that year. The airport group said the growth is a sign of the popularity of air travel in the face of challenging economic factors in several areas of the world. \"Passenger traffic remained resilient in the face of the global uncertainties that beleaguered many economies in 2013 and 2014,\" ACI World Director General Angela Gittens said in a statement. \"International tourism, in particular, was irrepressible in 2014 considering the geopolitical risks that have persisted in certain parts of the world, such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East,\" she continued. \"The Ebola outbreak also presented significant challenges to the aviation sector.

            "Topic: Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?\n",
            "Paragraph: All this isn’t to suggest that Americans never mark Veterans Day and Memorial Day. In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don’t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn’t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day. Differences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America’s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America’s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS’s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement.\n",

            "Topic: She was on course for stardom. Then she entrusted her career to USA Swimming\n",
            "Paragraph: PHOENIX — This was supposed to be the year Dagny Knutson became a household name by thrashing the competition in the pool in Rio de Janeiro. In 2010, Knutson was widely considered the next breakout American swimming star. At the urging of USA Swimming officials, she said, Knutson turned down a college scholarship and entrusted her career to the Olympic national governing body for the sport. And then it all went awry. In six years, Knutson has gone from odds-on Olympic star to cautionary tale through a series of twists and turns including a fired coach, an eating disorder and an unresolved fraud lawsuit against an Olympic sports insider who Knutson claims betrayed her to maintain friendships with USA Swimming officials. Knutson’s story, according to her and her lawyers, evinces the massive power imbalance in Olympic sports, where management enjoys monopoly control and athletes have little leverage. \"As athletes, we have to trust USA Swimming has our best interests at heart. And when they take advantage of that, we can’t do anything about it . . . Because they have all the power,\" Knutson said. \"I can’t think of any other explanation for why they did what they did, other than they don’t care.\" USA Swimming declined to comment for this story. In a deposition, USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus blamed Knutson’s situation on a former coach who made promises he wasn’t authorized to make. \"USA Swimming likes to do the right thing. We hang our hat on that,\" Wielgus said. Today, Knutson is a 24-year-old counselor for college students in Phoenix, living in a one-bedroom apartment with no trace of her former life as a world-class swimmer. The medals and Team USA garb are packed in boxes in her mother’s North Dakota home. \"She was just a thoroughbred that they wanted to put out to pasture, or get rid of,\" said her mother, Ronda Knutson. \"I’m just sickened by it.\" Born in 1992, Knutson grew up in Minot, N.D., a town of about 35,000 where neighbors leave garage doors open and front doors unlocked. Inspired by watching the 2000 Sydney Olympics with her father, Knutson started swimming competitively at age 9. When she was 12, Knutson set four state records, earning a mention in Sports Illustrated. When she was 16, Knutson broke the American record in the 400-yard individual medley and won six gold medals at a junior international swimming event, posting times that would have made her competitive at the Beijing Olympics the previous year. Her performances brought visits from USA Swimming officials to northern North Dakota, a region not known for producing elite swimmers. The only Olympic-size pool in the area was outdoors and lacked lights. Jim Knutson, an Army veteran and nurse, struck a deal for Dagny to swim there at night in the summer. Jim provided the lights by parking his Jeep near the pool. \"It’s just so different than the typical path,\" Mark Schubert, the venerated, longtime Olympic swimming coach, told The Washington Post in 2009 about Knutson. \"It kind of gives everybody hope.\" In early 2010, Schubert flew to Minot with a proposition for Knutson and her parents. Knutson had accepted a full athletic scholarship from Auburn University, but had just learned the coach who recruited her was leaving. Dozens of other colleges were interested in her, but Schubert recommended another option, according to Knutson: She could turn professional and train at one of USA Swimming’s \"Centers of Excellence,\" training facilities Schubert developed. Knutson would get more individualized attention, Schubert told her, and USA Swimming would offer the equivalent of a full scholarship, covering her tuition, room and living costs through the 2016 Olympics. Her parents had doubts, but after Dagny visited the Center for Excellence in Fullerton, Calif., she was convinced. She moved there in the summer of 2010 and enrolled in community college. The Knutsons never asked Schubert to put the offer in writing, a decision they would later regret. \"I don’t know if you want to call us naive or what, but we just had no reason to believe they wouldn’t do this,\" Ronda Knutson said. In November 2010, USA Swimming abruptly fired Schubert. No reason was given publicly, but Schubert and Wielgus’s relationship reportedly had soured. With Schubert gone, Knutson reached out to USA Swimming officials about her rent and tuition. It quickly became apparent they had no idea what Schubert had promised her. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, USA Swimming oversees nearly every level of the sport domestically and manages Team USA at the Olympics and other international events. In 2010, USA Swimming reported $26.4 million in revenue and paid Wielgus $781,000 and Schubert $368,000. Team USA swimmers, though, made stipends of $1,750 per month. Almost immediately, court records show, Wielgus expressed concern about the cost of the deal Knutson said she’d been promised. On Nov. 11, 2010, Wielgus emailed several other USA Swimming officials. \"Mark apparently made promises . . . to Dagny that: (a) he did not make me or others aware of; and (b) he did not have the authority to make,\" he wrote. Schubert denied guaranteeing Knutson tuition support after the 2012 Olympics, but both Knutson’s parents and two other witnesses to the meeting supported Dagny’s claims. Knutson’s agent connected her with Richard Foster, a lawyer well-known in Olympic circles. Foster has never won a medal or made an Olympic team, but he’s one of many members of the \"Olympic movement\" who has parlayed his relationships into income over the years. A collegiate water polo player, Foster has served in various capacities for USA Water Polo, the United States Olympic Committee, and FINA, the global organization that oversees international swimming. He wrote a book for Olympic legend Mark Spitz, secured a consulting position with a pool manufacturer and gained clients including several Olympic swimmers and Schubert, the famed coach. From the beginning of his negotiations on Knutson’s behalf, records show, Foster made clear to USA Swimming officials they did not need to worry about a lawsuit from Knutson. \"Chuck: As you know, I represent a lot of athletes, including a fairly large group of swimmers,\" Foster wrote Wielgus on Nov. 16, 2010. \"If an issue comes up, I will discuss it with you in hopes of resolving the issue. I won’t however get involved with litigation against USA Swimming. I have too many friends in the organization, including you.\" The next day, Foster emailed Wielgus to let him know an Associated Press reporter had contacted him. Word of Knutson’s situation had started to circulate. \"I told the reporter I couldn’t comment,\" Foster wrote. After months of negotiations, Foster emailed Knutson what he termed the \"final offer\": USA Swimming would cover Knutson’s college costs through 2016, but only if she maintained a spot in either the top 25 of the world or top three in the United States in one Olympic event. Before signing, Knutson balked at the performance requirement. She didn’t like the idea that if she had a bad year, or got hurt, she’d lose her college money. As her lawyer, Foster replied, \"A performance marker is not unreasonable.\" A few days later, he sent over the contract. \"Dagny: We wanted to get a little more up front, but this is a good deal,\" he wrote. She signed it. At first, things went well. Knutson moved to Gainesville, Fla., attended community college and trained under University of Florida Coach Gregg Troy. In 2011, she won a gold medal at the FINA World Championships as part of the 800-meter freestyle relay team that included Missy Franklin. In 2012, a private struggle Knutson had been dealing with burst into public view. She had an eating disorder — bulimia — marked by periods of binging followed by purging, or making herself throw up. Studies have shown eating disorder rates are higher among athletes, particularly women, than the general population. While Franklin won four gold medals at the London Olympics, Knutson cycled through inpatient and outpatient therapy. By the fall of 2012, her condition stabilized, Knutson asked USA Swimming to start her tuition assistance at a college in North Dakota, closer to home. Lindsay Mintenko, USA Swimming’s national team director, told Knutson her tuition support was over, because she’d fallen from the world rankings while in treatment. Without financial assistance, Knutson’s parents struggled to pay tuition and her travel and training costs as she tried to regain a national team spot . Knutson petitioned the NCAA to restore her amateur status, so she could get another scholarship, but her appeal was denied. She eventually retired from competitive swimming. In 2014, a friend connected Knutson with Bob Allard, a San Jose attorney well-known in Olympic circles for his outspoken criticism of USA Swimming for how it’s handled sex-abuse prevention. Allard felt that Knutson had viable fraud lawsuits against USA Swimming and Schubert, but as part of the deal Foster negotiated, Knutson had agreed not to sue either. There was one person she could still sue, though: Foster. \"Until I hired Bob, I knew I had gotten screwed over, but I didn’t know how,\" Knutson said. \"I thought it was all my fault.\" Last June, as Knutson’s former teammates and other Olympic hopefuls prepared for U.S. trials, Knutson sat in a California courtroom, looking on as Allard made his opening argument. \"This is a case about a well-connected lawyer in the aquatics industry who takes on, as a client, a young and vulnerable potential Olympic champion, but places her interests well behind those of his friends, his political allies and his business associates,\" Allard told the jury. \"That’s what this case is all about: a lawyer selling out his client.\" Foster pointed out the deal he got Knutson was the most lucrative USA Swimming had ever given a swimmer. When asked about his email assuring Wielgus he would never sue, Foster said his friendships help him and his clients. \"I can achieve good results negotiating with USA Swimming or any sport because of my involvement in the Olympic movement . . . They will take my calls,\" Foster testified. \"My personal relationship with them allows me access and to negotiate those deals. So if I file a lawsuit against them, I think that access is going to be gone.\" When asked why he didn’t comment to the AP reporter or ask the Knutsons if they wanted to take their story public, Foster explained that \"throwing Mr. Wielgus under the bus with the press . . . could have resulted in a very dangerous outcome for Dagny.\" Allard hired a malpractice law expert, Alison Buchanan, who concluded Foster violated ethical guidelines by not listing to Knutson all his conflicts of interest in writing. Foster also violated his duty to be a \"zealous advocate\" for Knutson, Buchanan testified. \"He wasn’t really working within her best interest,\" Buchanan said. \"I didn’t see any communications between Mr. Foster and USA Swimming where he took a hard stance or threatened litigation. Instead he said, ‘I would never sue you’ . . . That, to me, is the opposite of zealous advocacy.\" The jurors found Foster committed a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and they awarded Knutson $617,800. In October, however, the judge threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial. The judge ruled that Knutson failed to prove a different lawyer could have gotten her a better deal. Allard is appealing. In a recent phone interview, Foster said Knutson’s anger at him is misguided. \"I worked for her, for free, out of the goodness of my heart,\" Foster said. \"She’d been treated badly by USA Swimming. And I got her a good deal.\" In Olympic sports, Foster pointed out, national governing bodies rarely pay athletes much, and multiyear contracts are almost nonexistent. \"USA Swimming would not back down. They said, ‘We’re putting up a lot of money for an athlete that hasn’t even medaled yet,’ \" Foster said. \"Those performance markers for her were not unreasonable . . . She was one of the best swimmers in the world.\" In April, Knutson graduated from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, with a degree in sports management. She works at the school as a counselor, helping students apply for financial aid and pick majors. On weekends, she volunteers as a coach for the new swim team at a small Christian college nearby. It’s a small team of mostly novice swimmers, and Knutson thinks they don’t know her background. She doesn’t swim anymore; she prefers running. \"It feels like another human swam. It doesn’t feel like it was me. I used to have this self-confidence and this pride . . . I felt unstoppable,\" she said. \"I don’t feel that way anymore.\" During the Olympics this summer, Knutson was busy at work, so she missed most of it. She kept track online, to see how her former teammates fared. One night, she watched highlights on her phone as she walked to her car after a long day at the office. In Rio that day, 23-year-old Maya DiRado won an upset gold medal in the 200 backstroke. DiRado also silvered in two of Knutson’s old events, the 200 and 400 individual medley. Knutson was thrilled for DiRado, her former teammate from the junior national team. As Knutson drove home that night, she wept.\n",

            "Topic: Why You Might Not Actually Need Premium Gas\n",
            "Paragraph: Premium gas sounds like it’s something special, but it actually translates into paying extra for a higher octane without a performance or fuel economy benefit for many cars. That's what we found after running tests at our 327-acre track. While some cars require premium gas, many others simply carry a recommendation to use it. We wanted to see whether you can save money by using regular gas in cars that merely carry the recommended premium fuel label. Testing at the Consumer Reports Track To find out whether using regular gas in a vehicle that recommends premium gas had any effect on fuel economy or acceleration, we evaluated two models: the 2015 Acura TLX four-cylinder and the 2016 Nissan Maxima V6. Each recommends but does not require that the owner put in premium gas—guidance found on the placard on the backside of their fuel-filler door and often explained in greater detail within the owner’s manual. So long as you fuel the vehicle in accordance with the manual, you are protected by the powertrain warranty. In order to purge the cars of premium that could be in the fuel system, we drove them nearly dry, then ran through a full tank of regular gas before starting testing. All tests were conducted following our stringent fuel economy test protocol, with consumption measured through an inline fuel meter. Both sedans achieved the same fuel economy when tested with regular fuel as with premium. During this testing, the cars felt and sounded the same; we did not experience any engine pinging or knocking noise in either car when using regular fuel. The owner's manuals indicate that you might notice a decrease in performance when running on regular, but our test results say otherwise. The 0-60 mph acceleration times were identical in the TLX and Maxima on regular and premium gas. We contacted Acura and Nissan, asking both why they recommend premium gas. An Acura spokesperson referred us to the TLX’s owner's manual, which states, \"Use of lower octane gasoline can cause occasional metallic knocking noise in the engine and will result in decreased engine performance.\" A Nissan spokesperson wrote in an email that \"it is possible for the same performance to be realized using non-premium fuel.\" But the spokesperson did add that there could be some conditions where performance—which includes fuel economy—might be compromised, such as on extremely hot days. Nissan goes on to say that it is recommended to use premium fuel to guarantee advertised performance. Money in Your Pocket While gas prices remain historically low, the cost difference between regular and premium gas has increased over the past year. In 2015, there was a 39-cent difference between regular and premium, according to fuelgaugereport. But as of this writing, there is a 47-cent difference in the national average price of regular and premium gas. And given the lower pump prices overall, that 8 cents is an even greater percentage. Below we highlight the potential savings using regular instead of premium fuel assuming 12,000 miles per year and current gas prices. Fuel Economy Savings Per Year 30 mpg $188 25 mpg $226 20 mpg $282 15 mpg $376 What's the Downside? So it's okay to use regular even if the manufacturer recommends using premium gas. But check your car owner’s manual before making the switch, and remember that some automakers say premium is required. Wondering about the long-term effects of switching to regular fuel? Here's what we know: In conversations with manufacturers, never was there a connection made with using premium fuel for reliability reasons. The manufacturers only talk about higher octane in terms of performance. What's more, in the Acura owner's manual, Acura only recommends using \"top-tier detergent gasoline\"—which can be of any octane grade, regular or premium—for performance and reliability reasons. But there is nothing in the manual that equates premium gas with improved reliability. That said, if you make the switch and think your car is performing sluggishly, or you hear knocking or pinging, go back to premium fuel. Beyond these test findings, it is key to note our car reliability data consistently show that the most dependable cars tend to be those running on regular fuel.\n",

            "Paragraph: The first time Bill Clinton proposed to Hillary Rodham was at twilight in England’s romantic Lake District in the spring of 1973. She declined. The couple had recently graduated from Yale Law School and were at a crossroads in their two-year relationship. While the spurned Bill returned home to teach at the University of Arkansas and prepare to run for office, Hillary moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and rented a room near Harvard to study for the bar exam and begin work for Marian Wright Edelman at the Children’s Defense Fund. Hillary loved Bill but could not imagine herself making a life in his home state of Arkansas . Though she had grander ambitions, she still felt pulled in two directions. And then she got a nudge in what proved to be the right direction from an unexpected source: the biggest failure of her young life — one that she kept secret from friends and the public for 30 years, and that would have historic implications as well. The sky was the limit, or perhaps Arkansas was. Like her Rhodes scholar boyfriend, Hillary had been a politically minded overachiever for years. The Illinois native and former Goldwater girl had become a Democrat at Wellesley College during the late 1960s and enjoyed her first taste of national fame when she delivered the commencement address at the school’s graduation — one of several student addresses featured in the June 1969 issue of Life magazine. After Yale, the sky was the limit, or perhaps Arkansas was. As legendary Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein chronicles in A Woman in Charge, there were plenty of reasons for Hillary to avoid Arkansas. For one, moving there would mean she’d likely have to take a teaching job like Bill or work at a local law firm — not exactly her life’s ambition . Her friends thought she was crazy to even consider it, and Bill’s mother, Virginia, who had met Hillary in New Haven, was not a big fan of hers. Bill had always dated flashier women, including a former Miss Arkansas, and Virginia was not convinced that Ms. Rodham was good enough for her son. But after Hillary rejected his proposal in England, Bill was able to talk her into visiting Arkansas that summer ... and into taking the Arkansas bar exam. Still, when Bill and Hillary parted after her brief stay in Arkansas, Bernstein writes, \"their situation seemed totally unsettled.\" After sitting for the Arkansas bar exam, Hillary, along with 816 other aspiring lawyers, took the District of Columbia’s bar exam in July 1973. Passing that test was the No. 1 prerequisite to securing a decent legal job in the nation’s capital. Hillary then started her job at the Children’s Defense Fund, which she loved. Living alone in Cambridge, and without Bill, was hard, though. Hillary spent most of her salary, she later admitted, on telephone calls. \"Despite the satisfaction of my work,\" Clinton reflects in her autobiography, Living History, \"I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand.\" Then, in early November, Hillary received shocking news: She had failed the D.C. bar exam. A full two-thirds of the test’s takers had passed, many of them with a far less impressive educational pedigree than hers. \"For the first time in her life, she had flamed out,\" writes Bernstein, \"spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her.\" The future Mrs. Clinton was hardly the first person, or future leader, to fail a major examination. A Harvard Law School grad, and future first lady, named Michelle Robinson, failed her first attempt to pass the Illinois bar exam. Two future California governors, Pete Wilson and Jerry Brown, fared no better with the California bar. Winston Churchill famously failed the entrance examination to Britain’s elite Sandhurst military academy ... twice. \"[M]y heart was pulling me toward Arkansas,\" Clinton reflects in Living History. \"When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought maybe my test scores were telling me something.\" Northeastern University professor Daniel Urman doubts that the failure was a \"deal breaker\" for her move to Arkansas and that Clinton’s reading it as a sign probably stems in part from a \"motivated retelling of history.\" Still, it’s hard not to conjecture what turn her life — and history — might have taken had she passed the D.C. exam. A few weeks after the bad news, Bill came to visit Hillary in Boston and the two spent time exploring the city and planning their future. He had rented a small house on 80 secluded acres outside of Fayetteville and was eager for her to join him. Which she did, taking up her own post at the University of Arkansas in 1974 after several months in D.C. working on the Senate’s impeachment inquiry staff tied to the ongoing Watergate scandal. In 1975, she finally said yes to a subsequent proposal from Bill, and the two were married in Fayetteville. Hillary would keep her exam failure hidden, however, even from close friends, for the next three decades until she mentioned it, almost in passing, in Living History. The bottom line, as she would write: \"I knew I was always happier with Bill than without him.\"\n",

Garrett Pope, Sr. spoke to the principal of his late son's school to warn staff to be aware. They're not sure of where Garrett Jr. heard about the game. There's no history of it in their internet searches.

            "Paragraph: An Arizona State University professor who is facing charges of assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest says that police used excessive force in slamming her to the ground during an encounter. On May 20, Ersula Ore, an English professor, was stopped by university police near the ASU campus. Police said Ore was stopped because she was walking in the middle of the street and refused to provide ID, and that she later kicked an officer in the shin after they had her handcuffed, according to the Associated Press. Ore claimed she was walking in the street to get around construction. Now, dashboard video of Ore's interaction with Officer Stewart Ferrin, showing Ore being physically forced down to the pavement, is attracting attention as she claims police used excessive force. Video released to KTVK (above) shows part of the exchange between Ferrin and Ore: Ferrin: \"Let me see your ID or you will be arrested for failing to provide ID.\" Ore: \"Are you serious?\" Ferrin: \"Yes, I am serious. That is the law.\" In the video, Ore can be heard saying she has no problem following the law, but protesting that Ferrin is speaking to her in a disrespectful manner. Ore: \"I never once saw a single solitary individual get pulled over by a cop for walking across a street on a campus, in a campus location. Everybody has been doing this because it is all obstructed. That's the reason why. But you stop me in the middle of the street to pull me over and ask me, 'Do you know what this is? This is a street.'\" Ferrin: \"Are you aware that this is a street?\" Ore: \"Let me finish.\" Ferrin: \"OK, put your hands behind your back.\" The officer appears to swing Ore in a circle before forcing her to the ground as Ore yells for the officer to stop touching her. At least one person called 911 and said an officer was getting \"way too aggressive\" with Ore, according to a tape obtained by KTVK. Ore was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, refusing to provide identification when requested to do so by an officer and obstructing a highway or public thoroughfare. (UPDATE: See below for ASU's statement to The Huffington Post.) The school said in a statement, \"ASU authorities have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the arrest and have found no evidence of inappropriate actions by the ASUPD officers involved. Should such evidence be discovered, an additional, thorough inquiry will be conducted and appropriate actions taken.\" The Arizona Ethnic Studies Network believes this incident may be connected to racial profiling, and is criticizing ASU for not undertaking a full investigation of the incident with Ore, who is black. \"In a state and metropolitan region in which racial profiling has been proven to be widespread, the ASU administration's lack of concern for the well-being of an ASU community member of color is unacceptable,\" the Arizona Ethnic Studies Network said in a statement. Ore did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post. A petition on MoveOn.org with more than 2,800 signatures is calling on campus police to drop the charges and issue an apology. UPDATE, 9:49 p.m.: Although the university says there is no evidence of inappropriate actions by the ASUPD officers involved, it plans to review the incident further, according to a statement ASU provided to The Huffington Post:\n",

            "Paragraph: Kellogg’s is shutting down 39 distribution centers across the country, the embattled cereal giant announced this week. \"While this is the right move for the company to achieve our long-term objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on employees,\" company spokesperson Kris Charles said, according to CNYCentral. The Michigan-based company did not specify how many jobs would be lost during its year-long layoff plan, part of an initiative to shift toward a \"highly efficient warehouse model.\" Though as many as 1,100 full-time workers could be impacted, given Kellogg’s estimation that an average distribution center employs 30 full-time workers. Kellogg’s stock saw a decline and its brand perception online took a deep negative nosedive last year following the cereal maker’s politically-driven attack on Breitbart News and its 45 million monthly readers. The company complied with demands from obscure left-wing advocacy groups, who pushed a social media campaign to coerce companies away from advertising on Breitbart. Charles said Breitbart News and its tens of millions of readers \"aren’t aligned with\" the cereal maker’s \"values as a company.\" Breitbart News launched its #DumpKelloggs petition, which has been signed by more than 430,000 people. Kellogg’s beef with Breitbart News came amid widespread allegations of racism toward factory workers and profiting from the use of child labor. It was also reported that Kellogg’s politically-motivated nonprofit has close ties to radical anti-American billionaire George Soros, hate group Black Lives Matter, and deceased Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. The left wing campaign to coerce companies to pull their ads from Breitbart News has had \"little to no impact\" on the organization, Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said at the time.\n",

It’s going to be a bit of a wait, however. The app store will notify you when the game is finally launched, but this is a holiday title. According to Nintendo’s initial press release, Super Mario Run will launch sometime in December, though it’s unclear exactly when in the month we’ll be able to get our hands on it. When it does launch, I wouldn’t expect the sort of fanfare that typically accompanies a AAA launch. Mobile games tend to release without much warning, as we also saw with Pokémon GO in July. Things could be different this time around, however: Super Mario Run is already a much higher profile title than most iOS games out there, and so Nintendo might choose to strut its stuff a little bit more. There are plenty of mobile smash hits out there, of course, but this is some of the most concerted pre-release buzz I’ve ever seen for a mobile title. Super Mario Run represents a much deeper involvement with mobile development than Pokémon GO , which Nintendo neither developed nor owns the entire intellectual property for. This one is different: not only has Mario been Nintendo’s flagship character since he graduated from Donkey Kong to his own series, none other than legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself is involved with the project.

Super Mario Run is expected to launch on Android at an unspecified date after the iOS release.\n",

            "Paragraph: HBO This season of Game of Thrones has been already been an emotional roller coaster. And if you’re not caught up on the ride (aka the season) be aware that this article will have some Season 6 spoilers. Here’s Melisandre with a Bravos-style greeting as you happily go about your day. HBO/Giphy At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there’s one major character who hasn’t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven’t (and won’t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of. Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody’s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady’s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya’s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn’t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters. There was some speculation that the show may just skip over the character altogether and find other ways of getting to the same fates. People also thought that maybe the showrunners didn’t want to show a major character’s resurrection because it would take away from the (year-long) speculation about Jon Snow’s death. But now that Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are both headed to Riverrun (where Lady Stoneheart, aka Catelyn Stark, happens to be from) to deal with her brother the Blackfish, all the dominos are finally in place for the character’s big reveal. And, from what we know of Lady Stoneheart, she will definitely make an entrance (you know, if the show decides to bring her in). HBO/Giphy This season has already been filled with tons of stories of resurrection, both literal and metaphorical. From Jon Snow’s most obvious return to the resurrection of Arya Stark (with her reclaiming Needle and seemingly giving up her quest to give up her identity and serve the Faceless God) to Daenerys’ return to her rightful place as Khaleesi, it would definitely fit with the season’s overall theme. And it’s likely no coincidence that another Stark we thought was dead just happened to pop up, resurrected and transformed, in the last episode. Hopefully we can see this badass character make a memorable appearance. And, while they’re at it, maybe we can bring back Robb Stark just, you know, because? (*SWOONS AND CRIES FOREVER*)\n",

            "Paragraph: Bet you didn't know the best tennis player in the world also has some serious seamstress skills. Well, now you do. Serena Williams dished about her knack for sewing and more in an interview with DuJour magazine this week. \"My mom taught me how to sew when I was 2 or 3, so I've been sewing for as long as I can remember,\" Serena told DuJour. Back then the tennis pro's talent with the needle and thread was dedicated to making doll clothes, while these days its used more for wardrobe malfunctions. Case in point, the 31-year-old sprung into action during a recent photo shoot when her dressed ripped. \"I asked someone for the sewing kit and I just sewed it up right there,\" Serena said. \"Everyone couldn't believe it. You could never tell it was broken.\" And in case you forgot, Ms. Williams is also an author, actress, fashion designer and certified nail technician. With so much endless talent, it's hard to believe that the 5-foot-9-inch, 155-pound beauty has struggled with self-esteem. \"I wasn't always confident,\" Williams revealed. \"I just started feeling comfortable with myself about six or seven years ago.\" The tennis pro points to societal body image pressures and comparing herself to her taller and slimmer sister, Venus, as reasons for her self doubt. Plus, we're sure articles comparing her fabulous figure to a \"monster truck\" don't help. But the Olympic gold-medalist seems to be maintaining her new found confidence one day at a time. \"I love who I am, and I encourage other people to love and embrace who they are. But it definitely wasn't easy—it took me a while.\" Click HERE to check out Serena's entire interview with DuJour.\n",

            "Paragraph: Director Steven Spielberg says he contemplated retirement after completing his 1993 Holocaust film \"Schindler's List,\" according to a new profile by The Hollywood Reporter. Though the film won seven Oscars in 1994 — including best picture and best director — and cemented his legendary status, Spielberg reportedly lost interest in filmmaking because of the emotionally draining nature of the film. He had no desire to get back in the game. \"I just didn't,\" Spielberg said, explaining his four-year hiatus after the release of the film. \"I could not.\" In response to a question about whether working on \"Schindler's List\" sent him into a depression, Spielberg initially said yes and then backtracked. \"I've never been depressed,\" he said. \"I was sad and isolated, and as well-received and successful as that movie was, I think it was the trauma of telling the story and forming the Shoah Foundation.\" In the years after the film's release, according to THR, Spielberg spent his time \"sending videographers to interview Holocaust survivors,\" but he began to lose interest in feature films. \"I started to wonder, was 'Schindler's List' going to be the last film I would direct?\" Spielberg recalled. But in 1997, Spielberg said, the prospect of directing a sequel to one of his most commercially successful films \"seized [him] one day like a thunderbolt,\" and he returned to the movie industry with the release of \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\" \"I just needed time,\" Spielberg said.\n",

            "Paragraph: Project Fi isn't your average mobile phone carrier. That much was clear from the second I signed up for the service last fall. And now, after having personally used Fi for the better part of a year, I'm finding new ways it can make my life easier. Project Fi, if you aren't familiar, is Google's experimental wireless service for its own Nexus devices. It seamlessly switches your phone between a handful of networks -- Sprint, T-Mobile, and as of recently, U.S. Cellular -- to get you the best possible signal at any given time. It also taps into reliable public Wi-Fi networks (with its own layer of encryption in place) and uses those for your calls and data whenever it can. You pay only for the data you use each month -- at the same flat rate, even if you're roaming in a different country. It's an unusual arrangement that won't make sense for everyone, but if you're anything like me and my family, it could end up saving you some serious moolah. But hold the phone: There's more to Fi than just those basic benefits. Late last year, Google added an option for Fi subscribers to get data-only SIM cards that are tied to existing accounts. The idea is that you can pop a card into any SIM-supporting laptop or tablet and then get that device online at your same regular data rate, without any extra fees or complications. When I first heard about it, I thought: \"Hey, that's cool -- but I probably wouldn't use a feature like that very often.\" After all, laptops and tablets with SIM slots are relatively rare. And even if I had such a gadget in front of me, there just aren't a heck of a lot of situations in my day-to-day life where I need a large device with its own dedicated data connection. But then something struck me: Tablets and laptops aren't the only places where an option like this could be utilized. This feature's real value lies in something far broader and more useful -- something for which it isn't overtly advertised. The surrogate smartphone The inspiration hit whilst I was in the midst of a two-part experiment: one, spending a few days using my old 2013 phone for perspective, and two, thinking about ways I could use the word \"whilst\" in casual conversation. My old 2013 phone was the first-gen Moto X -- a device that's tiny by today's standards. In a lot of ways, I found returning to a phone of that size to be incredibly refreshing; while I generally enjoy my Nexus 6P, the truth is that it's always been a bit larger than I'd like. Particularly for times when I'm doing something active, it's just more bulk than I want in my pocket. Suddenly, a light bulb appeared over my head. After carefully taking it down (a floating glass bulb -- talk about a safety hazard!), I started thinking about the notion of using a smaller, older phone as a supplement to my 6P -- a surrogate smartphone, so to speak. If my dusty old device could somehow be tied to my regular cell number and service, I could grab it without any effort and stay connected while leaving my regular phone at home. With its excellent camera and always-up-to-date software, the 6P is obviously the superior device for most serious sorts of usage -- but whether I'm going to the gym, going for a bike ride, or going to do some random puttering about in the yard, there are plenty of occasions when I'd rather carry a device that's smaller, junkier, and just good enough to handle the basics without getting in the way. (Bonus: If I bang it against a weight, drop it during a run, or smudge it with a tasty coating of fresh mud, there's no need to worry.) Sure, I could move my main SIM card from one device to another when I want to make such a shift, but let's be honest: That's just enough of a pain in the ash that I wouldn't bother doing it after a while. But alas: I don't have to. And as it turns out, my surrogate smartphone scenario is just the tip of the iceberg. I'd actually stumbled onto something far more significant and versatile than I'd ever imagined. Single account, multiple phones You see where this is going, right? Whilst (!) thinking about the possibilities, my rapidly decaying brain somehow remembered Project Fi's data-only SIM option. \"Wait a second,\" I said to myself. \"That option may have been designed for tablets and laptops, but there's no reason it wouldn't work just as well with phones.\" \"Good point, jerkface. Now stop talking to yourself,\" I responded with a swift kick to the fibula. Once my internal quarreling subsided, I signed into the Fi website and placed an order for a data-only SIM card (for a grand total of $0 plus $0 shipping -- a price I can almost afford). And then I got to thinking about all the ways that little piece of plastic could come in handy. There's the casual-use surrogate smartphone situation we were just discussing, of course -- but the possibilities go much further. Think about it: 1. You could use the same setup to create a functional phone for a kid -- without having to pay for an extra line. Provided you have an old Android phone sitting around -- or are willing to buy a cheap budget phone to fill that role -- just toss the Fi data SIM in, set the phone up for your youngin, and cackle at your cash-saving cleverness. Whether your offspring is using the phone here and there for \"educational\" game-playing and video-watching or taking it out and about to stay in touch from afar, it's an easy way to keep your kiddo connected on occasion without having to start up a new account and deal with all the accompanying ongoing fees. As long as the phone is compatible with T-Mobile's network (which Fi defaults to using whenever a device isn't designed for its typical network-switching magic), it'll be good to go -- and any mobile data used on it will just factor into your normal pay-as-you-go monthly pool. (You may have to make a few one-time tweaks to the device's network settings before things will work properly, but that's pretty easy to do.) Just be sure to see below for an important asterisk about the phone's call-making capabilities. 2. You could use it to have a ready-to-go backup phone in case your primary device (or your significant other's) is ever missing, broken, or low on battery. There's nothing saying your surrogate smartphone has to be destined for any specific people or activities; you could just as easily keep it sitting around and ready to step in whenever the need arises. Think of it like a spare tire, only without any jacks or wrenches required. 3. You could use it to create a dedicated hotspot that'll beam out mobile data access without draining your primary phone's power. Pop the SIM into any T-Mo-compatible phone -- or, heck, even a standalone hotspot device, if you want -- and fire it up without having to worry about running down your own phone's battery. The phone call question \"Ah, but wait! A data-only SIM won't let you make and receive calls, will it?\" Technically, no (and thanks for the timely interjection!) -- but fear not, my friend, for all you need is the free Google Hangouts Dialer app to get around that restriction. Hangouts Dialer makes it possible to place and receive calls from your regular Fi number; it just uses data instead of regular cellular minutes. As long as you have a solid connection, be it via mobile data or Wi-Fi, using Hangouts Dialer for phone calls should work flawlessly. I've been using the app to make calls in the car from my \"data-only\" surrogate smartphone, and people have actually remarked that the call quality sounds noticeably better than normal. If you want to get really crazy, you can also use Hangouts Dialer to place and receive calls from an alternate number -- even while you're actively signed into the device. All you have to do is set up the free Google Voice service on a secondary Google account, then add that account onto the phone. Find that account in the settings section of the Hangouts Dialer app and just make sure the option for it to receive incoming calls is checked and active. To place a call from that other number, open up Hangouts Dialer, tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner, and tap the circular avatar corresponding with the account you want. Any calls you place in Hangouts Dialer will now come from that account's associated number. (And yes, that means you could actually use this method to keep multiple phone numbers associated with your phone -- say, a \"work\" number and a \"home\" number -- and be able to place and receive calls from any of them, anytime. Go nuts.) Again, it's worth emphasizing: Regardless of how many SIM cards you get or what you do with your secondary device(s), all you'll pay for is any mobile data used in any given month -- just like you do now on your primary Fi phone. Using mobile data across multiple phones is effectively the same as using that same amount of data on a single device. The only difference is the added convenience and versatility -- and I don't know about you, but that's something I'll happily accept. [SEE ALSO: How to get free home phone service from Google]\n",

            "Paragraph: After waking up almost entirely paralyzed in the hospital about 20 years ago, Ken Worrall asked to be disconnected from his life-giving machines. But, as he explains in the YouTube video above, online gaming eventually gave him a sense of purpose. Worrall was on a windy construction site when his accident occurred. An incorrectly fastened air duct fell and hit a pair of two-by-fours; Worrall's helmet broke under the impact. He woke up able to move only his eyes. Blinking in a yes-or-no binary code was initially his sole form of communication. His father persuaded him to give it time. Some time later, he was introduced to the Jouse, a mouth-operable mouse that made computer use accessible. Worrall began playing \"Diablo,\" and he was hooked. Known online as \"No Hands Ken,\" Worrall streams his play live to a mass audience via Twitch. By placing the Jouse in in his mouth and puffing it, he is able to right-click; by \"sipping,\" he can left-click. According to a Reddit AMA he held after his story's release on YouTube, it took Worrall about a month to master gameplay with the Jouse. And now hundreds of thousands of people have seen him play. Worrall never expected to catch people's attention -- or hearts -- in the way he has. When asked during his Reddit AMA how many people he expected to watch him, he wrote, \"Maybe thirty?... When I was in the thousands I was in a loss for words and I had tears running down my face because I've never had that sort of reaction from that many people loving me and wanting the best for me. It made me feel incredible.\" According to an interview with CTV News, one of his viewers recently wrote him a letter, saying, \"I was about to shoot myself.\" The man who had considered disconnecting is now saving others' lives. Worrall has big plans for his future. He's already fundraising so that he can attend BlizzCon, a gaming convention in California, and is considering becoming a motivational speaker. \"I am ready to talk to the world about me, my injury and how I live positive every day,\" he wrote on Reddit.

            "Paragraph: The best musicians are somehow able to come up with a song or piece of music on the fly that no one has ever heard before. They just let the music flow, riffing off something that exists and creating something new. That's what we call creative genius. But where does this improvisational ability come from? Charles Limb, a music-obsessed otolaryngologist and surgeon, wanted to know exactly that. Over the past few years, he's put jazz musicans and rappers into MRI machines to see what's happening in their brain as they freestyle and improvise. Results showed that when someone is creating something new, parts of the brain associated with self-expression (language and at times, especially while freestyle rapping, parts associated with visual imagery) are highly active. At the same time, and perhaps more interestingly, another part of the brain associated with inhibition quiets down. At a TEDx talk in 2010, he said it looks like it does this \"so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses\". Below is a graphic from Limb's studies that shows that while improvising, areas of the brain involved in self-monitoring – the sort of thing that might stop creativity – quiet down (those are blue); while areas of the brain connected to expression and language become very active (in red). TED It's important to be cautious about research like this, as Limb notes, because we're just scratching the surface here. We know very little about how the brain works. Plus, images of what's happening in the brain – as fascinating as they are – are still a sort of observational science. We see something that's happening but don't know what's driving it and certainly can't manipulate it yet, flipping a creative switch. But this is a start to understanding what creativity looks like. To first look at what was happening as a jazz musician came up with something new, Limb had six musicians go through a set of steps. First he had them play scales, then improvise on them. Then they played a memoriSed piece of music, and finally an improvised version of that – all while inside an MRI scanner. But they were up to the challenge. And all showed similar results while improvising – a dampening of parts of the brain associated with inhibition and an increase in activity associated with self expression. Here's another graphic showing the way that brain activity changed. Blue is a decrease in activity, red is an increase: TED When Limb first published his research on the topic, co-author Allen Braun noted the similarities between the brains of improvisers and the brains of people in REM sleep – while they were dreaming. \"It's tantalising to think some connection exists between improvisation and dreaming, which are both spontaneous events. These musicians may in fact be in a waking dream,\" Braun told Hopkins Medicine. Limb has followed this up with other research since then. He's shown that while improvising with partners, musicians' language centres in the brain are highly active, lending support to the idea that their music may actually be understood by the brain as a 'language' on its own. More than anything else, it's fascinating to start to look at what creativity is on a neurological level. After all, the brain is perhaps the greatest unexplored frontier in understanding how people work. We've mapped the human genome but are still trying to understand the massive network of neurons and glial cells beneath our skull. Concepts like creativity – the ability to make a mental leap and come up with something new – are even more mysterious. \"We know very little about how we are able to be creative,\" Limb says in the TED talk. But as he told Hopkins Medicine before, creativity is a fundamental part of humanity. \"Without this type of creativity, humans wouldn't have advanced as a species,\" says Limb. \"It's an integral part of who we are.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Has spam promising a larger male member with a pill or a cream ever tempted you to click? Hold off, guys. New research confirms that anxiety about penis size doesn't correlate to what's really in your pants. In fact, plenty of well-endowed men are ashamed of their penises, while lots of men with smaller penises strut their stuff with confidence, according to a study published online Sept. 30 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. The findings are no surprise, said study leader David Veale, a psychiatrist at King's College London. \"It's an emotional feeling,\" Veale said of penis shame. Like other forms of body dissatisfaction, penis-size anxiety is rarely linked to reality, he told LiveScience. Measuring up Men worry far more than women about penis size, according to Veale and his colleagues. One study, published in April in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that women preferred larger penises only up to a point (anything bigger than a flaccid length of 2.99 inches (7.59 centimeters) did not additionally impress women), and preferences also varied based on a guy's height. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found similarly ambivalent female preferences. In that study, women who experienced frequent vaginal orgasms were much more likely than other women to express an interest in better-endowed guys. For women who didn't prefer vaginal orgasms, penis size was a far less pressing matter. Nevertheless, men continue to fret over the size of their penises, listing it among their top body concerns along with height and weight, according to a 2008 study in the Journal of Health Psychology. Veale and his colleagues wanted to quantify that anxiety — an important step toward being able to evaluate psychological treatments designed to boost guys' self-image. To do so, the researchers recruited 173 men online and at King's College London, and asked them to complete a battery of questionnaires on body image, erectile function and concerns about their penises. In addition, 46 of the men agreed to have their penises measured by a urologist in both flaccid and erect states. Feeling shame By comparing the men's answers to the questionnaires to their stated concerns about their genitalia, Veale and his colleagues were able to narrow down their scale to 10 questions that were sure to reveal a guy's inner fears about his penis. The questions, available for download on the King's College London website, measure a man's fear of being alone or rejected because of his penis size, his terror that others will laugh at him, and his anxieties about being naked around women and other men. The most surprising response, Veale said, was men agreeing with the following statement: \"Others will be able to see the size or shape of my penis even when I have my trousers on.\" \"That must be extreme self-consciousness,\" he said. Among the men tested, 30 percent reported dissatisfaction with their genitals. About 35 percent of the men were very happy with their penis size, with the rest falling somewhere in between satisfied and dissatisfied. Older guys and gay or bisexual men were more likely to show high penis anxiety, the researchers reported. Gay or bisexual men typically have more body-image problems than straight men do, the researchers wrote, and also have more opportunities to compare body parts. The penises measured in the study ranged from 2.75 inches to 7 inches (7 to 18 centimeters) long in a flaccid-but-stretched state, and from 3.93 inches to 7.87 inches (10 to 20 cm) when erect. Girth ranged from 2.75 inches to 5.11 inches (7 to 13 cm) when flaccid and from 3.54 inches to 6.69 inches (9 to 17 cm) when erect. (A recent Journal of Sexual Medicine study found that the average American man's penis measures 5.6 inches, or 14.2 cm, long when erect.) The bottom line to all these numbers, however, is that they meant not a whit for men's perceptions of their penis size. Big or small didn't matter as much as the fears men carried in their heads. Some of those fears came from harsh experience, Veale said. \"Quite a few of them have been teased about their size either by an ex-partner or in the showers as an adolescent,\" he said.\n",

            "Topic: Why small dogs might really be more aggressive than big ones\n",
            "Paragraph: Whenever you go for a walk in the park, you see dog walkers being dragged in all directions by their charges. Sometimes you come across something huge like a Great Dane leading the charge, but as often as not it is a diminutive terrier barking the orders. Perhaps you have also seen funny videos of giant, docile mutts running in fear from pernicious pups. We asked our readers if they thought smaller breeds of dog were more aggressive than their larger cousins. Priyanka Habib got straight to the point. \"The tinier they are, the louder and crazier they are!\" The team found that the smaller males \"attacked sooner and with greater intensity\" than the larger ones Alan Clark offered an explanation: \"I think a lot of small dogs suffer from small dog syndrome. My teacup Yorkie is terrible for confronting big dogs.\" It is easy to imagine why \"small dog syndrome\" might arise. As Travis Souders put it: \"They're not necessarily mean, but they're certainly more commonly defensive. How would you feel if you were so tiny?\" Small dog syndrome has a human counterpart in the \"Napoleon complex\", when someone of diminutive stature compensates by being domineering towards others. This may make intuitive sense, but research suggests this phenomenon is anecdotal at best. David Sandberg of The University of Buffalo in New York and Linda Voss of the Peninsula Medical School in Plymouth, UK reviewed the evidence for a Napoleon complex in a study published in 2002. They concluded that \"the psychological adaptation of individuals who are shorter than average is largely indistinguishable from others, whether in childhood, adolescence or adulthood.\" We see this in nature all the time. Finches and sparrows harassing crows and eagles. Cougars fending off bears. It's not uncommon. Still, what holds true for humans may not necessarily be the case for animals. In a study published in 2012, researchers lead by P. Andreas Svensson of Linnaeus University in Sweden tracked the behaviour of fish called desert gobies. Male desert gobies defend nests, so the researchers introduced \"intruder\" males that the \"resident\" males had to see off. The team found that the smaller males \"attacked sooner and with greater intensity\" than the larger ones. So if small desert gobies can behave more aggressively than larger ones, could the same be true of dogs? There is a bit of a leap from a fish to a dog, but as Paul Durnion says: \"We see this in nature all the time. Finches and sparrows harassing crows and eagles. Cougars fending off bears. It's not uncommon.\" Chunyang Li suggests: \"Smaller dogs maybe feel scared about bigger ones, so they always try to protect themselves first of all, showing meaner behaviour.\" The problem with small dogs comes from the owners passing on their anxieties to the dogs themselves In a 2013 paper, Paul McGreevy of the University of Sydney in Australia and his team set out to explore whether dogs' outward characteristics are related to their behaviour. Dogs were a good species in which to study this, McGreevy wrote, \"because skull shapes and body shape are so diverse among breeds\". His team tried to find out if dogs that had similar physical traits also behaved similarly. They found that shorter dogs had higher levels of \"owner-directed aggression, begging for food, urine marking and attachment/attention-seeking\". In other words, based on this one study smaller dogs really are more aggressive, at least in certain circumstances. However, the data tells us nothing about why this is. The researchers concluded that it was \"impossible to determine from these data the extent to which the observed relationships are genetically or environmentally determined.\" Size might have an influence but it doesn't mean every little dog is vicious It is certainly possible that smaller dogs have an inbuilt tendency towards aggression, but there are plenty of other potential explanations – most of which have to do with the way humans treat dogs. \"The problem with small dogs comes from the owners passing on their anxieties to the dogs themselves,\" says Emmet Folens. \"They think that as they're small they are prone to be injured by big dogs and generally don't let them socialise as pups.\" Alternatively, Hayley Bayles thinks that \"owners of small dogs tend to feed their dogs the behaviour by treating them like babies and not actual dogs.\" Are they barking up the wrong tree or are they hot on the scent? McGreevy's study only showed a correlation between size and aggression, not an absolute link, says canine behavioural expert Daniel Mills of Lincoln University in the UK. \"Size might have an influence but it doesn't mean every little dog is vicious,\" he says. We also do not have good information on which breeds of dog attack the most. \"The literature on dog bites suggests you're more likely to report a bite from a German Shepherd than a Jack Russell, because it's a more severe injury,\" says Mills. \"So there's enormous unreliability in [the] available data.\" When interacting with little dogs, we may be less aware of early signals of aggression like staring I wondered if humans might be at fault for, perhaps unwittingly, coercing certain behaviours out of small dogs. Mills says there may be something to that. \"People think about these handbag dogs as commodities,\" he says. \"They're as much a status symbol as pit bulls. They're not happy being carried around in handbags and it affects their behavioural development.\" In fact there are many ways we can affect canine behaviour. \"You often get self-fulfilling prophecies,\" says Mills. \"If a certain behaviour is expected in a dog, it may become tolerated.\" We can also be a bit oblivious. \"When interacting with little dogs, we may be less aware of early signals of aggression like staring, whereas if a big dog stares and goes still, we think 'I'm not going to approach',\" says Mills. \"So the first level of what we see in small dogs is something like a snarl, which makes us think they're more aggressive than the bigger dog. [In fact] they're both just saying 'keep away'.\" The truth, it seems, is a bit fiddly. There is evidence that smaller dogs tend to be a bit more high-strung than larger dogs, but it may be people that create this difference in behaviour: either by raising small dogs differently, or by misinterpreting their actions. Maybe keep that in mind the next time you play with a Pomeranian.\n",

            "Topic: Should You Leave Your Laptop Plugged in All the Time?\n",
            "Paragraph: One often discussed question is whether it’s better to keep your laptop plugged in, or if you should use it on battery power. Turns out, the answer isn’t entirely straightforward. Let’s take a look. Know Your Laptop Battery For both types of batteries, the following statements are true (for modern laptops ): A battery cannot be overcharged. There’s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won’t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. There’s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won’t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. Fully discharging a battery will damage it. Having a battery fully discharged for an extended period can put it into a deep discharge state, from which it might never recover. So, based on this, do we conclude that you should simply leave your laptop plugged in all the time? Not quite. Things That Damage Lithium Batteries Charge/discharge cycles. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Voltage level. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery’s life. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery’s life. High temperature, over 30 degrees celsius. This can cause irreparable damage. Charge Level Lithium-ion batteries charge to 4.20V/cell, which amounts to 100% of its capacity. At this level, the battery will have a lifespan of 300-500 discharge cycles. Every 0.10V/cell reduction in the charge doubles the number of discharge cycles, until the optimum is reached: 3.92V/cell, with 2400-4000 discharge cycles. Unfortunately, at this level the battery is only 58% charged, so the runtime will be little more than half of a fully-charged battery. Heat And then there’s heat. Elevated temperatures, typically classified as being over 30 degrees celsius, will shorten the life of a battery irrespective of any other factors. Simply leaving your laptop in your car on a summer’s afternoon is a bad idea. When the stress of high temperature combines with the stress of high voltage, the effects are even greater. The Battery University tests showed that a battery stored with a 40% charge at 40 degrees would see its capacity fall to 85% after a year. Charged to 100% the capacity falls to 65% under the same conditions. For a fully charged battery at 60 degrees the capacity plummets to 60% in just three months. The evidence seems clear. Keeping the battery permanently charged at 100% will slowly shorten its life. Keeping it at 100% and exposing it to high temperatures will shorten it much quicker. Should You Remove The Battery? If heat is such a danger, it begs another question. Should you remove the battery altogether when using your laptop on AC power? If you do choose to remove the battery, ensure that you store it properly. This means charged to between 40% and 70%, and kept at room temperature. Recommendations Curiously, the industry as a whole doesn’t seem to have settled on a single answer for the question about whether to use your laptop on AC or battery power. Apple’s advice is no longer on its website, but you can still read it online . The company recommends against leaving a laptop plugged in all the time. Instead, it suggests: An ideal user would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing Leaving your laptop plugged in will not cause short term damage, but if you only ever use it on AC power you’ll almost certainly find that after a year the battery’s capacity has been significantly reduced. Similarly, if you only ever use it on battery power you’ll get through the battery’s discharge cycles quicker. So, the best solution is something of a compromise between the two: use it on battery power some days, and keep it plugged in on others. And in all cases, you’ll want to ensure it doesn’t get too hot. How do you use your laptop? What steps do you take to keep your battery lasting for as long as possible? Let us know in the comments.

            "Paragraph: Dushka Zapata is a writer and executive coach, she explained to Quora the ideal way to breakup with someone gracefully. I know. People do horrible things to each other and often we are better off without someone. I will set these open and shut cases aside. What about the times where the guy (or woman) we are breaking up with is not right for us but is a thoroughly decent human? What if people do the best they can? What if those we select to share our lives with were well chosen and as such happen to be splendid people? What if they know us better than anyone? What if aside from lovers they are friends? What if we can manage to change the terms of our relationship with them without losing them? Aren’t they worth rescuing? Shouldn’t we consider turning our backs on the colorless narrative that a breakup means war, that a person we loved must become an enemy? If you want to break up with someone, please don’t wait. Don’t put it off because \"you don’t want to hurt him\" or \"because it’s not the right time\". You will hurt him. It’s never the right time. Don’t (ack) disappear or dwindle or attempt to fade into the horizon or send subtle signs or let the information trickle and \"speak for itself\". Please don’t break up via text or phone. Break up in person, face to face. Then, be as direct and as clear as you can. While assembling these clear and direct words keep in mind that your priority is to preserve the other person’s dignity. (And yours.) The person in front of you is someone you used to love and spend time with. Think of the day you met, about the times you were excited to see his name on your screen, instead of thinking of the fights or the last few weeks. Who we are is not who we are at our worst. Who we are is a collection of everything. To do this moment justice, conjure the full picture. Assume, in your conversation but also in your thoughts, that what went wrong was you. Blame is a form of aggression towards the person you are talking to but mostly an aggression towards yourself. Nothing is more disempowering than not being responsible. Keep the entire process private. This is the end of your relationship, painful and intimate. It does not belong on Instagram. Then, give it time. My hope for you is that one day not too far into the future you will be having dinner with him and he’ll offer an insight into your life that clarifies something, illuminates something, untangles something. \"You always know what to order within seconds of opening the menu. It’s exactly how you make decisions about what you want\" he’ll say. And you’ll know that you have before you a person who understands everything.

            "Paragraph: Since he announced his bid for the presidency in June 2015, Donald Trump steadily accrued the support of a number of celebrities — some of whom are more notable than others. In the run-up to his 2016 presidential election, Trump earned a variety of endorsements in the entertainment world, from former sports stars like Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman to musicians like Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. Most recently, Roseanne Barr has sparked controversy for her vocal support of President Trump (and her promotion of far-right conspiracy theories). Here are 31 celebrities who have supported President Trump: 1. Roseanne Barr Trump’s most vocal celebrity supporter of late, Roseanne Barr has a history of tweeting her support of the president. „4 those who wonder-back in the day when I was called a ‚liberal‘ by journalists, I used to answer-‚I’m not a Liberal, I’m a radical‘ & I still am-I voted Trump 2 shake up the status quo & the staid establishment,\" Barr tweeted in December. 2. Jon Voight In a statement to Breitbart in 2016, the actor said that he supported Donald Trump as the Republican nominee because „he’s an answer to our problems.\" Voight also called Trump „funny, playful, and colorful, but most of all, he is honest.\" He added, „He has no bull to sell, and everyone will discover the bull most politicians spew out is for their own causes and benefits.\" Before Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, Voight said at a Washington D.C. rally of Trump that Abraham Lincoln „is smiling knowing America will be saved by an honest and good man who will work for the all the people.\" 3. Scott Baio The „Happy Days\" and „Joanie Loves Chachi\" star has previously said he likes how Trump communicates. („He speaks like I speak,\" he told FoxNews’ Judge Jeanine Pirro.) In his speech at the RNC in July 2016, Baio said, „We need Donald Trump to fix this. Is Donald Trump a messiah? No, he’s just a man, a man who wants to give back to his country, America, the country that has given him everything. „Hillary Clinton wants to be president for Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump wants to be president for all of us,\" he added. \"So, of course, let’s make America great again, but let’s make America, America again.\" 4. Gene Simmons The Kiss member told Rolling Stone in 2016 that Trump is „good for the political system.\" He supported Trump’s idea to build a wall, saying, „The Pope has said the wall is unkind, but it’s interesting that at the Vatican there’s a wall. They don’t want people on the outside coming into the Vatican.\" Though the article largely shows Simmons displaying his approval of Trump, toward the end, Simmons makes his support a little less clear: „Trump is not a politician. He does not need your money, and he will speak his mind, God damn it, whether you like it or not. And he has no problem saying, ‚F— off.‘ I like that. Even if I disagree.\" 5. John Ratzenberger The „Cheers\" and „Toy Story\" star announced his support for candidate Trump on Fox News. „I want us to become self-reliant again … The only candidate out there is Donald Trump, for me, because he’s a builder,\" he said. „He understands better than anybody that if we lose the people — average age is 58 years old by the way of people that actually know how to build things — once they’re gone, they’re gone and we don’t have anybody comin‘ up behind them.\" 6. Stacey Dash The „Clueless\" star and Fox News contributor has previously voiced her support for Trump, calling him a „great businessman\" who „has the Rolodex to get to the people around the world who make the decisions.\" She also tweeted a photo of herself in front of the White House and said she’d help Trump „take out the squatters … Bronx-style.\" Dash also gave financial support to the Great America PAC, a super PAC that said it was the leading outside group supporting Trump. 7. Clint Eastwood The conservative director voiced his support of Trump before the 2016 election, telling Esquire that he appreciated Trump’s tendency to „[say] what’s on his mind,\" in a time when „everybody’s getting tired of political correctness.\" 8. Ted Nugent The musician wrote an article for WorldNetDaily in 2016 in which he said that Trump „should be given the Medal of Freedom for speaking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.\" He performed in support of Trump at one of the Republican nominee’s final campaign stops. Nugent reportedly grabbed his crotch and shouted „I’ve got your blue state right here, baby!\" to the crowd in Sterling Heights, Michigan, a traditionally Democratic state that ended up going red in 2016. 9. Paul O'Neill The former Yankee outfielder endorsed Trump by appearing at one of his Florida rallies in March 2016 — much to the chagrin of many Yankee fans, as the New York Daily News reported. 10. Dean Cain The ex-Superman initially told The Hollywood Reporter that he was „not a Trump guy,\" and instead opted for Ted Cruz. However, once Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, his hand was forced. „I’m not voting for Bernie Sanders and I’m not voting for Hillary Clinton, so I guess that makes me a Trump guy,\" he told „Fox & Friends\" in May. 11. Kid Rock Kid Rock showed his support for the presidential hopeful in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, saying that he’s „digging Trump.\" He also added: „Let the motherf—— business guy run it like a f—— business. And his campaign has been entertaining as s—.\" 12. Robert Davi The actor wrote multiple posts for Breitbart in 2016 praising Trump. In one, he said, „We should thank God that Trump is in this race. The media and the establishment are terrified.\" 13. Johnny Damon The former New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox center fielder endorsed Trump in a New York Daily News interview in March 2016. „I’m a Trump fan ever since I met him seven or eight years ago,\" Damon said. „Everything he does, he does first-class.\" 14. Loretta Lynn Country singer Loretta Lynn told a Reuters reporter in January 2016 that „he’s the only one who‘s going to turn this country around.\" 15. Bob Knight The legendary college basketball coach has been a vocal supporter of Trump. He introduced the businessman at Indiana rallies in early 2016, saying that he believes Trump will end up being „one of the four great presidents of the United States.\" 16. Jesse James James, a TV personality and founder of West Coast Choppers, posted a lengthy Facebook message in January 2016 supporting his former „Celebrity Apprentice\" boss. He said: „Ive met a lot of people in life and I have found it best to form opinions about them by actually meeting them in person. … What I personally observed is a man that is perfect suited to run this country. … One thing you know about me is Good or bad I will always tell it like it is. This guy is the Real Deal, and will Make America Great Again.\" 17. Dana White UFC president Dana White spoke in support of Trump at the 2016 RNC, saying, „Let’s be honest folks, we need somebody who believes in this country, we need somebody who’s proud of this country and who will fight for this country. … Donald Trump is a fighter and I know he will fight for this country.\" 18. Mike Tyson The former heavyweight-boxing champion endorsed Trump while appearing on HuffPost Live in October 2015. „He should be president of the United States,\" Tyson said. Tyson explained that, as a Muslim, his support of Trump didn’t waver despite the Republican nominee’s proposed ban of Muslim immigrants. 19. Stephen Baldwin Baldwin, who was fired by Trump on two different seasons of „The Celebrity Apprentice,\" said during an interview in 2015 with Don Lemon on an episode of „CNN Tonight\" that Trump would make a „great\" president „because he’s not a politician, and he doesn’t care what anybody thinks.\" Baldwin in 2016 urged Christian voters to ignore Trump’s lewd and aggressive „p—y\" comments because he thinks Trump is „really fun\" and „a family guy.\" 20. Gary Busey The actor endorsed Trump in 2011, even after being fired from season four of „The Celebrity Apprentice,\" and offered his praise for the presidential nominee in 2016. „He’s a great guy. He’s sharp. He’s fast,\" he told Fox411. „He can change the country after the last eight years.\" 21. Teresa Giudice The star of „The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" went on „Watch What Happens Live\" with Andy Cohen to say she was „of course\" going to vote for Trump in 2016. „I think he’s amazing. I think he’ll make a great president,\" she said. Giudice was also a former contestant on Trump’s „Celebrity Apprentice.\" 22. Dennis Rodman The retired pro-basketball player tweeted: „@realDonaldTrump has been a great friend for many years. We don’t need another politician, we need a businessman like Mr. Trump! Trump 2016.\" He was fired from season two of „The Celebrity Apprentice.\" 23. Lou Ferrigno When asked by TMZ for his thoughts on Trump in 2016, the actor and former bodybuilder said, „I hope Donald goes all the way.\" He was also fired from a season of „The Celebrity Apprentice.\" 24. Hulk Hogan  TMZ asked Hogan in 2015 which 2016 Republican presidential candidate he would want to face in the ring, but instead of answering the question, he said he wanted to be Trump’s running mate.\n",

            "Paragraph: The new Chuck Taylors are here. The first new design in 98 years. I’m wearing them right now. These absurdly, blindingly white objects are shoes. More precisely, they’re the much-hyped Converse Chuck IIs, which were released on Tuesday. By the end of that first day on sale, these lowtops were the last pair of size 11 shoes left at the company’s Manhattan flagship store. I snagged ‘em. The store had seen a rush on the newly redesigned shoes that day. The sales associate just shook his head when I handed him the popular standard-issue black hightop model. \"Try online,\" he suggested. I told him I would take any pair of the coveted new All Stars that they had in my size. Usually when there is a rush for shoes, it’s caused by a bunch of sneaker nerds lining up to get some special edition. In this case, it was more like people lining up for iPhones. This shoe will be mass-produced. There will be more next week, and the week after that, and assuming people keep buying them, there will be Chuck IIs for a hundred years, which is about how long ago the originals were released. The Converse flagship store in SoHo, New York was almost completely sold out of Chuck IIs in my size on the day the sneakers were released. But I think I understand why there was a rush on the new Chucks, even by unfashionable schlubs like me. Besides Jordans, it’s hard to imagine a shoe more iconic and beloved than the Chuck Taylor. I remember when I finally convinced my dad to let me get a pair in middle school, even over his objections that they were shit shoes that were going to fuck up my feet. I’ve gone through a pair or two per year ever since. I never found the shoes as painfully uncomfortable as some people, but their hundred-year-old design isn’t especially ergonomic. People are psyched about the new Chuck II because it retains much of the classic Converse look—I actually think they’re kind of hotter now—while introducing new design features that make them legitimately comfortable. The new Chuck II on the left, the old-school Chuck Taylor on the right. You can see many of the aesthetic changes in the sweet comparison video shot by my colleague Michael Hession. Converse sent us black hightops, but they were a size 9 which is unfortunately way, way too small for me. How do they feel on the foot? After spending a day in my new bright shining kicks, I can tell you for sure, they’re more comfortable. They feel like real shoes now, instead of like shoddy canvas sacks for feet. At the core of the design is a new foamy insole made of Lunarlon, a springy foam material designed by Coverse’s parent, Nike. Don’t let the marketing term fool you though, this is just a comfy insole. It feels much like one you would buy to put into your running shoes. In this case it’s nice to have it specially shaped and designed for the shoe itself. Besides the insole, the biggest change is the no-slip tongue, which indeed does not slip. It’s a huge change for the Chuck Taylor. The old tongue that wiggles its way to the side over time is so common that it’s central to the Chuck Taylor aesthetic. There are some aspects of the sneaker’s redesign that we’ll have to wait and see on. The Chuck IIs use some tougher-looking (and feeling) rubber construction of the rubber sole as well as the rubber that binds the sole to the rest of the shoe. This tends to be where the old-school chucks fall apart over time. Sponsored Additionally, the new chucks use a tougher canvas, which makes the overall shoe feel sturdy like it’s got real structure that supports your ankles, rather than serving as just a flimsy coat that’s draped over your feet. Will the new Chuck be more durable, or suffer the same fate of its flimsy predecessor? Is it even a Chuck Taylor if it doesn’t turn to shit over time? A pair of hightop Chuck IIs cost $75, compared to $55 for the old-school All Star. It’s worth it.\n",

Teddy Bear, the latest in a line of animal Super Bowl forecasters, is predicting that the Seattle Seahawks will defeat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Before you place those bets, keep in mind the porcupine prognosticates this by picking corn out of either a dispenser representing the Seahawks or the Patriots.

            "Paragraph: Light-up shoes are a popular trend that has had a steady following for several years. Almost every child has owned a pair of these shoes and business isn’t slowing down. They’re an automatic hit with children who love to stomp around the house incessantly as they show off the stellar light performance in their shoes. Have you ever stopped to wonder what powers the light? Two parents were stunned by the destruction they suspect was caused by their son’s shoes. A couple in Katy, Texas noticed an odd haze building up in their vehicle. When Jovan and Attila Virag opened the back of their SUV, they smelled the familiar scent of burnt plastic and noticed that there was a hole burned into the floor and the back of their passenger seat was melted. They sifted through the contents in their backseat, but there was nothing that could have started a fire except for their 2-year-old son’s light-up shoes. When Attila took apart one of the charred shoes, she noticed that the lights were powered by lithium batteries. The father hadn’t the slightest idea that there were batteries in the shoes that could short and we suspect he isn’t alone. Understanding the mechanics of a pair of shoes isn’t high on most people’s priority list. The fire marshal was called in to investigate what may have caused sparks to ignite in the vehicle. A decision about the origin of the fire hasn’t been determined yet, but the shoes are being considered a possibility. The Virags are desperate to share this information with other parents. They were lucky that their son wasn’t wearing the shoes when the fire started. Otherwise, the consequences could have been way more severe. Although light-up shoes may be high up on your child’s wish list, it might be safer to err on the side of caution or at least do your research before purchasing the shoes.\n",

            "Paragraph: There are many scary roads out there, some stretching for miles without street lights, or some that are not paved and go through dangerous mountain passes, however few roads will be able to beat how scary some bridges are that people have constructed over the years. In fact, some bridges are so crazy like the Eshima Ohashi bridge in Sakaiminato, Japan, that people shouldn’t even be allowed to drive on it! This bridge is so crazy that it has recently been given the name \"The Roller Coaster Bridge\" and is catching the eyes of many people who pass by photos of it. The bridge connects the cities of Matsue and Sakaiminato, Japan, and from afar looks like any ordinary bridge that you might find crossing a river. The catch comes in when you learn about the river though. The bridge crosses over a major river which provides access to ports for large ships which means that the bridge had to be built extremely high up so that the ships could pass through underneath with no problems at all. In order to reach a suitable height for the ships, a steep incline is needed to get the cars high up enough before crossing the river which causes the bridge to acquire a terrifying image: This type of structure is absolutely terrifying, and I know that I would not feel happy having to drive up this type of incline! The bridge is beautifully designed, and though the slope looks extremely steep in these pictures, the engineers were able to design it with a max slope of 6.1 percent, which is pretty good. This means that for every 100 feet of horizontal distance the bridge extends, it rises 6.1 feet. This may seem like a minuscule number, but in the field it is quite a respectable slope! This allows the bridge to be \"safe for all drivers\" no matter how terrifying it may initially seem. The bridge is able to boast the number four spot on TripAdvisor among 24 attractions in Sakaminato for the thrill it provides to tourists riding over the bridge at the amazing height. There have fortunately enough been no accidents on the bridge yet, and officials are confident that there will continue to be none. The bridge has also caused quite a stir online, with people commenting on whether or not they would want to cross the bridge, and people are even posting videos now from their dash cams of them simply driving over it because other viewers on the internet want to be able to feel what it is like for themselves to cross such a scary bridge. If you want to see more shots of the bridge in action and see the cars going up and down, there is a video below with several video shots from several different angles of the bridge, which should be able to give you a better idea to the size and height of this roller coaster ride.\n",

            "Paragraph: One Rock Legend Really, Really Wants To Be In Guardians Of The Galaxy 3 By Eric Eisenberg Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is still months away from release... but things look pretty damn good for the future of the franchise. The series is easily one of the most popular within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's pretty easy to imagine Marvel working to complete a full trilogy even if the first sequel is a let (which we certainly don't think it will be). As a result, there is already plenty of anticipation for what could wind up being called Guardians of the Galaxy 3 - but the project has picked up interest from one interesting individual in particular: Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. The musician/actor recently had the opportunity to have a sizable role in the new indie horror movie Happy Birthday, and it was while sitting down with People magazine that he revealed his interest in being a part of the Marvel family -- specifically out in the cosmos with writer/director James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy. Discussing his feelings about acting post-Happy Birthday and his potential future as an actor, Steven Tyler said, I hope [audiences] enjoy [Happy Birthday]. I know I did! It made me want to do more movies for sure, I would do anything to be in Guardians of the Galaxy 3 -- are you listening James Gunn? Steven Tyler, as mentioned, is best known as the lead singer of Aerosmith, but he does have some acting experience under his belt. In addition to playing himself in movies like Wayne's World 2 and Be Cool, he's also played legitimate roles -- such as in Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express and Epic. Of course, he's also spent time as an American Idol judge, which is a certain level of performance as well. And let's not forget that Tyler already has a family connection within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well, as his daughter, Liv Tyler, played Betty Ross in The Incredible Hulk. Regardless of his experience and connections, however, whether or not Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 could actually find room for Steven Tyler is a legitimate question. The first film already had a massive ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, John C. Reilly, Michael Rooker and more, and the upcoming sequel is adding to that group with exciting stars like Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff. I suppose it's possible that Tyler could wind up being given a small but important part -- like the one that Sylvester Stallone will be playing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Would you like to see Steven Tyler land a role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3? Is there a particular part you think he would be well-suited for? Hit the comments section below with your thoughts!

            "Paragraph: If the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, why do rivers meander their way towards a larger body of water? Today, we answer this question with help from MinuteEarth. In states like Nevada, Washington and Vermont, a river’s course is determined by the mountainous structures surrounding it. Like MinuteEarth mentions, these rivers \"are literally set it stone.\" But, in states like Indiana and the Great Plains, river banks made of soft soil can easily shift and change a river’s course. According to MinuteEarth, all it takes is a little disturbance and a lot of time. It's a good thing nature has plenty of both.  If one bank of a river is disturbed and begins to crumble, water fills the hole and sweeps away loose dirt. Over time, this creates a bigger and bigger hole in the river bank. As the water begins to rush faster through the new opening, it slows on the opposite river bank. Because slow-moving water can’t carry as much weight as fast-moving water, loose dirt and rocks build up on that side, making it more shallow. Eventually, the build-up creates new land and a new curve in the river’s watercourse. The new curve causes the water running against the outside bank to pick up enough momentum that it slams into the opposite bank further down the river, creating another curve. As more time passes, the rushing water creates more and more curves downstream.  Even though the wider the river, the longer the distance is to the next curve, MinuteEarth explains that the creation of these curves tends to happen in a similar pattern all over the world. Generally speaking, the length of one S-shaped curve is about six times the width of the river.  And, as long as nothing interferes, this process and pattern will continue, and the river will grow curvier and curvier. \n",

            "Paragraph: We may take it for granted, but texting really is one of the most significant technological advancements of the past several years. The ability to send short, instant messages helps us build and maintain strong relationships, even when we’re too busy to call. When we aren’t able to get in touch with those people we text the most, it’s jarring. Why aren’t they available to us right now? we’ll wonder. But for one mother, it was an unexpected message that shook her to her core... Carole Adler couldn’t have been closer to her son, Taylor Thyfault. The young man would frequently text his mother about all sorts of things to keep up with her. They were always in touch. Just about any mother would speak highly of her children, but there was something extra special about the way that Carole talked about Taylor. Their relationship was undoubtedly a close one, ever since day one. Of course, the feeling was mutual for Taylor, who wasn’t shy about telling his mother about all sorts of important things. He’d often tell her about all of his life’s goals, many of which he was lucky and hard-working enough to achieve. For example, Taylor told his mother about a list of various things that he wanted to accomplish in his life, including wrestling an alligator, coaching a lacrosse team, owning an English bulldog he would name Diesel, and never getting arrested. Taylor seemed determined to achieve everything on his list. He joined the U.S. Army and he really took the motto of being \"the best that [he] could be\" to heart—despite his mother’s concerns about the dangers of his profession. Another one of Taylor’s goals was to pursue a career, but he didn’t want just any old job. He became a state trooper, which allowed him to create plenty of opportunities to achieve another one of his goals: to save a life. As proud and supportive as Carole was of her son, she also couldn’t help but be concerned about the dangers of his job. One day, at the scene of an accident, Taylor decided to text her updates on the situation... It was May 23, 2015, and Taylor’s cadet training was almost complete. Very soon, he would be a fully fledged police officer, just like he had always dreamed. For the time being, though, he still had a job to do on this ride-along. Carole’s memory of that fateful morning remained crystal clear. \"Taylor texted me that day at 7:30 and said ‘I’m at an accident at Highway One and Highway 66,'\" she recalled, sadly. Taylor, along with another trooper, were warned of a potentially dangerous high-speed chase that was heading in their direction. So they both set up stop sticks to try to slow down the oncoming encounter. That’s when tragedy struck. When the car in question came rushing toward the two men, the driver didn’t stop — and he hit both of them. The other trooper was critically injured, while Taylor was killed instantly. Yet the two men in uniform weren’t alone. There was also a tow truck driver at the scene of the original accident who came out almost completely unscathed — and it was all because the heroic Taylor had shouted at him to get out of the way before he lost his own life. This was undeniably a tragedy, but there was at least one bittersweet aspect of the story. In his final moments, Taylor had managed to complete one last goal from the list that was so important to him: he saved a life. Taylor had died a hero. He’d accomplished a great deal in his short life, but there were still so many things that he would never have the opportunity to experience. However, his legacy didn’t exactly end there... Taylor didn’t tell anybody about the list but his mother she was even the last person that he spoke to before he died. Clearly, they had a special bond. As she mourned the loss of her son, Carole continued to text him, knowing he couldn’t answer. Carole thought that nobody else would know about her secret messages to her deceased son, but there was, in fact, a living person who was seeing every text that she sent. He happened to be another police officer... After Taylor’s untimely death, Sergeant Kell Hulsey needed a phone with a new number. Incidentally, he received the young man’s old number, and he formed an unexpected connection with Carole. Initially, the police sergeant ignored Carole’s mysterious messages, but once he figured out what was going on, he couldn’t let it go any longer. What happened next was an extraordinary moment... \"I’m with the Greeley Police Department, and I don’t think your texts are going where you think they are,\" Sergeant Kell Hulsey sent. He then offered to switch numbers, but Carole insisted that he keep it. The grieving mother said that it eased her sorrow knowing the line was going to someone who had the job her son dreamed of one day doing. \"I am honored that a police officer of your credentials has his number,\" she told him. Carole still texts with Husley, who, after hearing about Taylor, has found a renewed passion for his career and is grateful to know that he has someone else looking out for him. Adler still texts him, reminding him to be safe. \"It’s good for me to remember all the wonderful things he was looking forward to,\" Husley says. \"It’s like I always have a little angel in my pocket now.\" Though Taylor’s actions ultimately led to a life being saved, it also proves how a person’s passion can sometimes put them in harm’s way. Connor Cummings, a second-year college student from Rockaway, New Jersey knew this all too well... Connor loved getting involved with anything that allowed him to flex his creative muscles, and he had a strong passion for photography. Friends said it was rare to catch him without a camera in his hand. In fact, he’d recently landed a job taking photos at his school in Massachusetts — a dream job for someone like Connor. Naturally, he saw it as a huge stepping stone to a photography career once he graduated college. Over Christmas break in 2015, his parents bought him a brand-new Canon camera to congratulate him on landing the job. They wanted him to start with his best foot forward, and a sleek new camera was the first step towards success. On New Year’s Eve, Connor ventured into New York City to get some photographs of the cityscape at night. The city had amazing views, and the young photographer wanted to capture its beauty through his new lens. Along with his friend, 18-year-old Dimitri Olivares, who also had a knack for photography, Connor headed into the city. The two young men were excited to return with a roll full of great pictures to show their friends and family. The boys hopped a subway into Midtown, and as soon as they got off, they headed to a building near Times Square to start shooting. They could already sense some spectacular images were about to materialize. Soon enough, their search for some even better views led the boys to the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street. They knew hotels often boasted rooftop balconies, and they were excited to find awesome angles of the Big Apple. Far from being concerned about security, they walked right into the hotel and stepped into the elevator, taking it to the top floor, which was 52 stories up. Once there, they climbed a few flights of stairs to the roof — and found the door unlocked. The roof, however, wasn’t as high as the intrepid shutterbugs wanted to get. So when they spotted some scaffolding, they decided it was the perfect way to find the right vantage point without the risk of getting caught by hotel security. Cameras held tightly in their grasp, the two boys carefully climbed the scaffolding. Eventually, Connor asked Dimitri to pose for a picture mid-climb, and that’s when tragedy struck... As Connor was positioning himself to take the picture, he stepped back through a hole in the scaffolding. The hole hung above a nine-story drop—and Connor plummeted to his death. Dimitri was horrified, and he fled the scene without telling anyone what just happened.\n",

            "Paragraph: Oregano may seem like an unlikely ingredient in the fight against climate change. But this modest herb could make cows’ methane-heavy belches — a big contributor to the warming of our planet — a little less potent. Oregano’s essential oil contains carvacrol, an antimicrobial that kills off some of the methane-producing bacteria in the cow’s rumen. Danish researchers who are investigating oregano’s methane-suppressing abilities hope that it could reduce cows’ methane emissions by a quarter. Nearly 15 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to livestock, and 65 percent of that total comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. NPR points out that oregano oil isn’t the only solution to cutting down cows’ ballooning emissions. Scientists have explored unpronounceable alternatives like 3-nitrooxypopanal, a methane-inhibiting chemical. But those may not be compatible with organic guidelines, and many of the people who care about cows’ methane emissions are the same ones who buy organic milk. We could just eat less dairy and beef. But while some Americans are starting to shift away from meat, that change may not happen soon enough. It might behoove us to get our cows chewing oregano cud, since that could be one small solution we could implement fast.\n",

            "Paragraph: Think the Grand Canyon is big? British scientists working in West Antarctica have discovered a subglacial trench that's deeper than Arizona's famed canyon. Whoa. The scientists found the colossal trough while charting the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands, an ancient subglacial mountain range in the area, and detailed the discovery in a paper published in the January issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. \"The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterization of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous,\" the paper's lead author, Dr. Neil Ross, a physical geography lecturer at Newcastle University in the U.K., said in a written statement. \"To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now.\" Dubbed Ellsworth Trough, the trench was created tens of million years ago by a small, \"dynamic\" ice field that slowly carved out the dramatic formations now hidden beneath a layer of ice more than a mile thick. With the help of ice-penetrating radar, the scientists found the trough to be more than 186 miles long, up to 15 miles across and, in some places, 1.8 miles deep, according to a written statement released by Bristol University. The Grand Canyon has an average depth of about 1 mile and maximum width of 17.9 miles. The Ellsworth Trough is so large, it can be seen from space -- yes, even beneath all of that ice. As Gizmodo reported, NASA helped researchers map the trough by sharing satellite imagery that provided a big-picture view of the subglacial canyon. \"By looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice-penetrating radio-echo sounding and satellite imagery, we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms, such as u-shaped valleys and cirques, that could only have been formed by a small ice cap, similar to those seen at present in the Canadian and Russian High Arctic,\" Dr. Martin Siegert, a member of the research team and professor of geosciences at the University of Bristol in the U.K., said in the written statement. \"The region uncovered is, therefore, the site of ice sheet genesis in West Antarctica.\"\n",

            "Topic: Realistic Optimists May Have More Success And Happiness, Study Suggests\n",
            "Paragraph: Are you a \"glass half-full\" or a \"glass half-empty\" kind of person? As it turns out, some people can be both. So-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found. These realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said Sophia Chou, an organizational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, who presented her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Honolulu, Hawaii earlier this month. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy] Optimists and pessimists Past research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. But a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, Chou said. Optimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall. After several years working in business, Chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. She wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed. So Chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in Taiwan. The surveys tested how many \"positive illusions\" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality. Realistic views The optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists. \"Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement,\" Chou said. Interestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, Chou said. Traditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy. To understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments. Self-control key She found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships. \"Every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won't say 'I have no choice and this is the only thing I can do.' They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,\" Chou said. That allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present. Being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said. The findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said. In order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said.\n",

            "Topic: Is a rare birth defect actually helping American breaststrokers?\n",
            "Paragraph: RIO DE JANEIRO — The old swimming adage is that breaststrokers are born, not made. You often can look at a swimmer standing still and tell whether they are a natural fit for the most esoteric of the four strokes. Start from the ground up: Most successful breaststrokers have duck feet that point outward, making it all the easier to perform the frog kick that goes with the stroke. Flexible ankles are a plus. So is a long torso. But what if there is one other rare physical trait that lends itself to excellence in breaststroke? And what if that trait is a birth defect? It sounds crazy, and it might be nothing more than coincidence. But two of the three American Olympic breaststrokers here were born with a chest wall deformity, and a third elite American breaststroker has the same physical abnormality. Kevin Cordes, who was a finalist in the 100 breast earlier this week and finished eighth in the 200 breast final Wednesday night, has a condition known as pectus carinatum. It is characterized by a protrusion of the sternum and ribs. Cordes is, essentially, pigeon-chested. He had surgery in third grade to mitigate the appearance of it, leaving him more numb in the lower sternum. Teammate Cody Miller , the bronze medalist in the 100 breast, has the inverse effect: pectus excavatum. That’s a sunken chest, where the ribs and sternum have grown inward. Sam Tierney, an All-American at Missouri who was a semifinalist in both the 100 and 200 breast at Olympic trials, also was born with pectus excavatum. Tierney had surgery in high school to expand his chest, wherein doctors inserted a metal bar for two years. So that’s 66 percent of the American Olympic breaststroke crew, and 37.5 percent of the top eight male breaststrokers in the country, if you go by their top times over the last year. Research estimates that 0.2 percent of live births have the same condition as Miller and Tierney, and 0.006 percent have Cordes’ condition. Those are striking percentages. Again, it could be mere coincidence. But as Cordes said when I pointed it out, \"That’s crazy.\" I asked all three athletes if there could be a correlation – if perhaps the chest shape contributes to the physics of successful breaststroke. Cordes said he didn’t know. Miller was doubtful. Tierney was more open to the idea. For all three, the chest-wall issues were (or are) a cardiovascular challenge. Miller and Tierney said their lung capacity and stamina were inhibited. Tierney’s surgery alleviated that issue, while Miller (who has not had a corrective surgery) has simply overcome it. \"I think I’d be a better breaststroker with a normal chest,\" Miller said. Certainly so, from an aerobic standpoint. But what about stroke mechanics? I’m particularly thinking about the pull, which brings water into the chest as the hands come together beneath the body. Could there be a benefit in a slightly misshapen chest creating something of a spout for that displaced water to go? Tierney pointed out that he, like many swimmers and particularly breaststrokers, has poor posture. His shoulders come forward and chest is down, a common physical trait in swimmers due to greater muscle mass on the front of the torso – it essentially pulls the shoulder into a slouch. That’s also a common posture profile of someone with pectus excavatum. \"That’s what breaststroke pull is,\" Tierney said. \"Your shoulders are coming forward while your chest is in.\" Miller, a student of the stroke who has observed Cordes’ technique for years, sees another physiological characteristic that might help his American teammate. \"His ability to hold his body line in water has more to do with his scoliosis,\" Miller said. \"You can very easily see his arched back. That helps his body line, which allows him to bring his heels up and have curvature of his torso.\" That’s part of what makes breaststroke different – it is an undulation stroke that is all about rhythm and mechanics and flow, and less about pure speed and power.\n",

            "Paragraph: \"There’s no check on this,\" said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. \"Once NSO’s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they’re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.\" The NSO Group’s capabilities are in higher demand now that companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are using stronger encryption to protect data in their systems, in the process making it harder for government agencies to track suspects. The NSO Group’s spyware finds ways around encryption by baiting targets to click unwittingly on texts containing malicious links or by exploiting previously undiscovered software flaws. It was taking advantage of three such flaws in Apple software — since fixed — when it was discovered by researchers last month. The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target’s personal life and what governments they will do business with. Israel has strict export controls for digital weaponry, but the country has never barred the sale of NSO Group technology. Photo The founders of NSO Group, Omri Lavie, left, and Shalev Hulio. Credit NSO Group Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group’s finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions. The company’s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013. \"Our intelligence systems are subject to Mexico’s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,\" Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. \"They are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.\" Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U.A.E. and Mexico after last week’s disclosures. For the last six years, the NSO Group’s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones — including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems — without leaving a trace. Among the Pegasus system’s capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls \"room tap\" can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone’s own microphone. Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone’s web browser. And all of the data can be sent back to the agency’s server in real time. In its commercial proposals, the NSO Group asserts that its tracking software and hardware can install itself in any number of ways, including \"over the air stealth installation,\" tailored text messages and emails, through public Wi-Fi hot spots rigged to secretly install NSO Group software, or the old-fashioned way, by spies in person. Much like a traditional software company, the NSO Group prices its surveillance tools by the number of targets, starting with a flat $500,000 installation fee. To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users — on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal. You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter. What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is \"unlimited access to a target’s mobile devices.\" In short, the company says: You can \"remotely and covertly collect information about your target’s relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities — whenever and wherever they are.\" And, its proposal adds, \"It leaves no traces whatsoever.\"\n",

            "Topic: Hollywood Has Had Its Worst Summer In Over A Decade And Here’s Why\n",
            "Paragraph: 20th Century Fox The blockbuster summer of 2016 will probably go down as one of the worst summers that Hollywood studio movies have ever experienced. Despite earning box office receipts only fractionally lower than those earned in the $11 billion (£8bn) bumper year of 2015, it’ll likely be remembered as the worst year since 2001. So why are critics and fans alike bemoaning how abysmal 2016 has been? Fox Movies There are a lot of definitive reasons for the backlash happening against blockbusters and some that are purely speculative. But one of the undeniable factors is that there are simply too many studios trying to make too many tent-pole movies, without the audience share to go around. That means that more massive movies are competing for the same amount of box office takings. In that scenario, unfortunately, there are going to be casualties like The BFG, which despite being critically acclaimed and having a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 75 per cent, was widely seen to have flopped. Paramount But it’s not just gate receipts that films are being maligned for. One of the most solidly performing movies of the summer was Suicide Squad, which more than recouped its budget both in the U.S. and overseas, but is still being held up as one of the summer’s biggest disasters. Why is this? Well, mostly because it failed spectacularly to live up to the massive hype and marketing which had promoted the film after it was utterly trounced by critics. Which brings us on to the next reason that Hollywood will consider this year a failure – audiences are just a bit sick and tired of rehashed movies made from existing source material. This year, it felt like every film was either about a superhero or was a remake/reboot of some existing and revered source material. Take Independence Day: Resurgence for example. That could have been a huge film, appealing as it does to a young audience who like to see landmarks get blown up by green fire, and an older audience who remember seeing the original in the cinema – perhaps it was even the first film they saw on the big screen. But where the original was new and exciting at the time (and crucially had Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum), nowadays too many films plough the same apocalyptic furrow for any of us to really give two fucks any more. Even though these movies are remakes or continuing a ‘cinematic universe’, another reason why these films crashed and burned was that they weren’t very good to begin with. Mostly for the fact that they ignored basic tenets like story arc and character development in favour of blowing shit up. Not that audiences are tired of seeing explosions – Michael Bay has built a career out of it – it’s just that we’d like to have some kind of investment in the characters who are being blown up. When you don’t spend time doing ‘formulaic’ things like developing your characters, then audiences just don’t give a damn when impossibly handsome people are being attacked by aliens. Disney A part of the reason why Hollywood execs are afraid to include more story development, humour and humanity in the typical blockbuster is because of the expense involved in making these cookie cutter summer films – Batman v Superman reportedly had its budget pushed to $400 million! So it’s natural to assume that in the editing room you’re not going to cut that super expensive scene with Superman throwing an oil rig into space (this scene doesn’t actually exist, for the record), instead you’re going to cut the scene with him having a human moment where you get to know his character. Another reason for these choices is the belief that overseas audiences, particularly China, are more interested in the action scenes than the human, emotional ones. Although, the success of Finding Dory throws doubt onto that reasoning. My main reason, personally, for avoiding the cinema this summer is because none of these dull, plodding superhero movies appeal to me anymore. They’re all trying to recreate The Dark Knight formula of being edgy and moody with some kind of super deep political or philosophical sub-theme – we’re looking at you Zack Synder. But they just end up failing spectacularly at being something they’re not, instead of just trying to be different, take risks, and thrill the audience. Netflix Again, it probably comes down to money as the reason why blockbusters are a creative vacuum – but it’s also down to the fact that the most engaging cinematic experiences nowadays are the ones happening on the small screen. This summer has been dominated by the critically acclaimed The Night Of (itself a remake of a British crime drama Criminal Justice) and Stranger Things, an unapologetic homage to ’80s pop culture nostalgia. Both of these aren’t exactly breaking new ground but they approach their material with a weight and tone absent from similar procedurals (The Night Of) or a genuine enthusiasm (Stranger Things) that is largely absent from the typical tent-pole summer movie. HBO As long as summer movies are too expensive to be truly creative, attempting to appeal to emerging foreign markets, and continue to rehash old franchises or ideas, then people are going to keep their cash in their pockets and get their cinematic fare at home via services like Netflix or by playing hyper-immersive cinematic video games like Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. I mean, would you rather spend £10 on going to see yet another fucking X-Men movie or would you prefer to spend that cash on a Netflix subscription so you can binge watch Narcos in the comfort of your own home and then play GTA:V ’til your eyes bleed while imagining that you’re Pablo Escobar? Netflix I know which I prefer.\n",

Find Your Forecast Search for a location Daksha Rangan Digital News Reporter Sunday, July 24, 2016, 1:55 PM - An alarming amount of plastic and garbage is churning through the North Pacific Ocean, killing wildlife and destroying marine ecosystems in its path. More than 10 million tonnes of garbage swirls through all the world's oceans, flowing with diverging currents in what's been called a \"trash vortex,\" or, alternatively, the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\" Known for being virtually impossible to clean up, these accumulation zones remained relatively untouched since their discovery in the late 1980s -- aside from research and scientific expeditions to better conclude a solution. Now, for the first time ever, an effort to clean up the millions of square kilometres that make up the trash vortex is underway. SUMMER 2016: Visit the Summer Forecast Guide to the Season for the 2016 Summer Forecast, Fall Weather Preview and much more A prototype ocean cleaning system, developed by a Dutch organization, has been released in off the coast of the Netherlands in the North Sea, ABC News reports. The Ocean Cleanup -- the CEO of which founded the organization at 17 years old -- is self-described as \"the first feasible method to clean up the world's ocean garbage patches.\" The project uses a floating barrier to capture \"virtually any type of debris,\" operating on rotational currents. The barriers use a screen rather than a net to catch garbage, allowing marine wildlife to pass underneath along the current without getting trapped. The organization's site notes that over the course of ten years, a single 100 km stretch of \"artificial coastline\" can grab nearly half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Their mission is to achieve the largest ocean clean-up in history. The prototype's objective is not to see how much garbage can be caught, but rather if the technology can withstand the rough currents in the North Sea, CEO Boyan Slat told ABC News. The final clean-up is expected to begin by 2020. Thumbnail image courtesy of NOAA, Wikimedia Commons. SOURCE: The Ocean Cleanup | ABC News\n",

After the tenth baby photo of the week, or 12-too-many ‘inspirational’ quotes, all of a sudden the cursor is hovering over that last resort – the ‘unfriend’ button. Inevitably the axe is bound to fall a few times over the years. But new research has uncovered a more common reason for getting unfriended than both baby pics and pseudo intellectual life-coaching. According to the study, conducted by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, politics is the ultimate no-go zone when it comes to Facebook, and it is the single most common reason to get you kicked off people’s friends list. The Israeli researchers picked the extremely controversial issue of the Israel-Gaza conflict and found that during a recent surge of violence in 2014, 16 per cent of the participants in their study had unfriended someone based on their political views. quotesgram.com Nicholas John of the university said: People unfriend people who have different political views to theirs. We already know that Facebook and search engines provide us with a feed and search results that are tailored to us. These findings suggest that the people most likely to unfriend are younger, more politically active, more active on Facebook, have lots of Facebook friends, and have more extreme political views — these are important people in online discussions. It seems like the results could be a little skewed by focusing on a highly controversial topic like the Gaza conflict, but it’s good to know that people are unfriending over the important stuff isn’t it?\n",

            "Paragraph: The challenges of a job at the White House are tough and manifold, but at least one of them—the challenge of getting heard—has historically been tougher for women. For one thing, there are fewer of them at the table: all presidents so far have been men, and among their top aides men have to date heavily outnumbered women. But another factor that weighs on how much women’s ideas get heard and credited isn’t confined to politics. Across sectors, and both in and outside work, women get interrupted more often than men—by people of both genders. The interruption disparity, backed up by decades of research, is now so recognized there’s a word for it: manterrupting. But at the White House, one former staffer explained to the Washington Post, women started using a simple rhetorical technique to stop interruptions and reinforce points made by other women. When a woman made a good point, another woman would repeat it, and give credit to the originator. This made the idea harder to ignore, or to steal. The women called the technique \"amplification.\" \"We just started doing it, and made a purpose of doing it,\" one of president Barack Obama’s former aides told the Post. \"It was an everyday thing.\" She said that Obama noticed and began calling on women more often. The women, perhaps unconsciously, had noticed two things. First, that repetition is one of the simplest ways of reinforcing any point—which can be seen through history across oratory and poetry. But secondly, that simply hammering a point home by repeating it oneself has limitations, especially in a competitive environment where everyone is clamoring to be heard. Some researchers have hypothesized that women are interrupted more because their conversational style tends to be collaborative, where men tend to be more competitive. The trick may have come about organically, but it’s by no means a given than women should support each others’ ideas that way. The presence of only a few women in a room historically gave rise to a different response, noted Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in her book Lean In: In the days of tokenism, women looked around the room and instead of bonding against an unfair system, they often viewed one another as competition...women wound up being ignored, undermined, and in some cases even sabotaged by other women. It’s a safe bet that many Obama staffers, and those who come after them, will have read books like Lean In and taken the lessons away. The ideas of cooperation they promote are already making their way into the wider workplace.\n",

She went without makeup for the movie and put on some weight for the role. Fake fake scars cover her face and body. It's the kind of part she'd been \"dying to do for years.\" Aniston said, \"It's like a catch-22. It's you know, ‘Please let me play this part. I know I can do it.' But then they won't give you the part because they don't know if you could do it. \"So, it's hard,\" she continued. \"You have to just wait for that wonderful brave human being who sort of says, ‘This is interesting to me and all of us to take [the] risk and be bold.'\" Cake is in theaters on Jan. 23. Directed by Daniel Barnz, the cast also includes Adriana Barraza as Aniston's loyal housekeeper, Anna Kendrick, Sam Worthington, Chris Messina, Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy.

            "Paragraph: EA Confirms Battlefield Remasters To Be Developed Under One Condition With Activision releasing a remastered Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare later this year and the rising popularity of backwards compatibility, it looks like EA might draft up some remastered Battlefield games in the future. Even though the overall production of remastered games has slowed down for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it is still something that players desire, especially when it comes to beloved games that many gamers spent hours upon hours playing on last gen consoles. Talk of remastered Battlefield games can be exciting, especially since the original title, Battlefield 1942, was only released on PC and might be a great addition to the ever-growing collection of first-person shooters available on consoles. Patrick Soderlund, EA Studios Executive Vice-President, had a recent interview with International Business Times and the topic of remastered Battlefield games was brought up. It looks like there isn’t currently a remaster in the works as of yet, but if there is enough demand from fans the tables can absolutely be turned. \"I wouldn’t say never. We’re not doing it right now, we’re focused on Battlefield 1 – but if we think the fans want that I see no reason we couldn’t.\" – Patrick Soderlund Soderlund further discussed additional details on the upcoming release of Battlefield 1, touching on Zeppelins, the ability to ride horses, and the implementation of aquatic vehicles. With so much work involved with this game, it’s no wonder that remastered versions of previous Battlefield games is not currently on the priority list. This is the first Battlefield game in many years to take place during the past as opposed to a modern setting, so it can be suggested that EA has listened to what fans actually want to play and made it happen. With that being said, fans wanting remastered Battlefield games should voice their opinions and keep their fingers crossed that EA will listen to them again.\n",

            "Paragraph: Diet Coke, despite not tasting anywhere near as good as regular Coke, is still a popular choice for those of us inclined to consume sugar-free sodas that make us temporarily feel better about all the shitty choices we've made—and will continue to make—in life. Popularity aside, there's also a fair amount of controversy surrounding Diet Coke's impact on the human body. In a thorough refuting of the most prominent Diet Coke damage theories, the Outline's Yvette d'Entremont is calling bullshit on the demonization of America's favorite aspartame vessel. Ever peeped an article about Diet Coke causing cancer and/or multiple sclerosis? You probably have. However, as explained in the Outline's detailed rebuttal, these claims are thus far \"full of shit.\" Initial concern regarding an increase in various types of cancers actually began eight years before aspartame was introduced to consumers, with additional testing showing no causal relationship between the sweetener and cancer. As for MS fears, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society says there's currently \"no scientific evidence\" supporting claims of aspartame causing the chronic disease. The same goes for claims of Diet Coke causing depression, claims which arguably peaked upon publication of a 2013 study by the American Academy of Neurology. The study, which the Outline describes as \"an example of correlation and causation gone horribly awry,\" found that 4.3 percent of participants reported being diagnosed and treated for depression within a 10-year period. That study, as noted by the British Dietetic Association's Gaynor Bussell to BBC News at the time, was a \"one-off\" and should not be viewed as proof that such sweeteners cause depression. So Diet Coke allegedly gives you no cancer, no multiple sclerosis, and no depression? Damn. But it's definitely making everyone fat, right? Nah. The swath of articles out here placing the weight gain blame on Diet Coke, d'Entremont explains, typically all share one fatal flaw: the only variable is soda consumption. Additionally, many studies that end up being cited in articles with sensationalized headlines often fail to have participants thoroughly report their caloric intake. The full rundown of Diet Coke slander can be peeped here, though ending this post without some advice from a leading H2O enthusiast would just be unfair: Water holds the information and energy Drink more water. Also, enjoying the occasional non-water beverage probably won't destroy every fiber of your being. \n",

            "Topic: A Young Girl’s Perfectly Preserved Body Was Unearthed. But What She’s Holding Is a Mystery\n",
            "Paragraph: A tiny coffin with the preserved body of a three-year-old girl is probably one of the last things these workers expected to find when renovating a San Francisco home. But what made this discovery even more puzzling is what the little child was still clutching in her remarkably unspoiled hands. It all started when Ericka Karner decided to remodel her childhood home in San Francisco’s Richmond District. Karner was not actually around at the time, however, as she had moved to Idaho to live with family members while the work took place. But, as construction workers arrived at the house, there was no indication that this job would be any different from others that they’d done before. That said, this perception quickly changed not long after they began their work. Indeed, on May 9, 2016, three feet beneath the floor of the garage, the workers’ shovels hit something solid. So, instead of soldiering on, they took the time to excavate the object, and they couldn’t believe what they were seeing: it was a miniature coffin, about three feet in length. The two glass windows of the metal coffin unveiled the face of a little girl with pale skin and blond hair. Despite having been buried for a long time, though, the corpse looked amazingly well preserved. And, upon further examination, the workers identified one more interesting detail: the girl was clutching a red rose in her hands. As one of the discoverers later told KTVU, \"There were flowers – roses, still on the child’s body. It was a sight to see.\" The workers immediately contacted Karner by phone, informing her of the eerie find. The news was, quite understandably, a little creepy, but Karner did the right thing by contacting the medical examiner to open the casket and identify the body. The coroner who arrived on the scene estimated the girl to be about three years old and reckoned she had been buried sometime around the 1870s. It also became apparent that it was likely she was laid to rest at Odd Fellows Cemetery before it was shut down in 1890. In fact, most of the bodies from this cemetery were moved to a burial plot in the nearby town of Colma during the 1930s to allow for the construction of homes in the area. But, for whatever reason, this young girl was forgotten. And while the mystery made for an interesting story, Karner was soon told that the body was her problem because the girl had already been properly buried – so it wasn’t classed as an abandoned corpse. This meant that the city wouldn’t take responsibility for it. Worse still, Karner was informed that she would need a death certificate for the unidentified girl if she wanted to give her a proper reburial. Karner was understandably upset about the decision. As she told a newspaper, \"It didn’t seem right. The city decided to move all these bodies 100 years ago, and they should stand behind their decision.\" While several parties came forward with offers to bury the girl, the invitation came with a steep price tag. Indeed, one undertaker asked for $7,000 for the service, while an archaeological company asked for $22,000. To make matters worse, the body was now beginning to deteriorate, since the seal that protected it from the air outside had been broken during the coroner’s examination. Certainly, the coffin spent so much time in Karner’s custody that her two daughters even decided to name the little girl – Miranda. It wasn’t until city officials did some research that an alternative option was finally devised. They told Karner to contact the Garden of Innocence, a Californian non-profit that helps give unidentified and abandoned children decent burials. Elissa Davey, the founder of the organization, immediately had the coffin moved to refrigerated storage – until they could figure out where and when to bury Miranda. \"That girl was somebody’s child,\" she explained. \"We had to pick her up.\" A genealogist by trade, Davey opened the Garden in 1998 after hearing the story of a local infant who had died after being abandoned. She couldn’t get the story out of her head, and she decided to contact the coroner to claim the boy and give him a proper burial. Since then, the Garden of Innocence has laid to rest almost 300 unidentified children. And, far from just burying them in a casket, each child is also given an official memorial service that can be attended by local residents. Miranda herself was finally given a burial ceremony on June 4, 2016, in Colma’s Greenlawn Memorial Park. Her casket was carried in by fully-uniformed members of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization dedicated to charity that partners with the Garden. The ceremony lasted for an hour, with some 100 people gathering to mourn and pay their respects to the seemingly forgotten child. As the coffin was lowered into the ground, Miranda could finally rest in peace after 145 years of being lost. Miranda’s DNA was tested before the funeral, and that may lead to her true identity being discovered in the future. For now, though, she rests under the name \"Miranda Eve,\" with her tombstone reading, \"The Child Loved Around The World. If no one grieves, no one will remember!\"\n",

            "Paragraph: UPDATE: The privacy settings on Claire Warner's photo have been changed, but if you'd like to see an example of the symptom she referenced, click here. Claire Warner \"never dreamt\" she'd be posting a photo of her breast on Facebook. Now, however, that photo has gone viral — but probably not for the reasons you might predict. Warner posted a close-up of her left breast to Facebook, revealing a seemingly innocuous dimple that could actually be a sign of breast cancer. \"This is a picture of my left boob,\" Warner writes in her Facebook post. \"The small purplish bruise is where I had a biopsy taken. The minuscule dimple up and to the left of it is a rare and little-known symptom of breast cancer.\" Though the most common symptom is a new lump or a mass in the breast, a dimple and/or puckering on the breast is also a sign of breast cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About one in eight women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer at some point. Warner explains that she flagged the \"blink-and-you'd-miss-it\" symptom \"exceptionally early\" thanks to another post shared by a friend, and is now sharing her photo as a warning to everyone else. \"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE check yourself (males as well as females) and get your loved ones to check themselves also,\" she writes. \"If I can help one other person, the way I was helped, then it's been worth showing my soon-to-be-reduced left tit to the world.\" After alerting her doctors to the dimple, Warner underwent surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and says she has \"every hope of being cured.\" At the time of writing, the photo has received over 25,000 shares on Facebook, with users commenting on Warner's ability to think of others in her own time of difficulty. \"You are amazing and strong and you'll be fine and even in this, you're putting others first,\" one user wrote. \"With you all the way.\" \"I will be checking mine, thanks for sharing this and wishing you all the best,\" another commented. If you spot something unusual on your breast — be it a lump, a dimple, or a change in shape or size — it's smart to heed Warner's advice. While official recommendations no longer suggest getting regular physical breast exams (or doing self-exams), experts do strongly advise being familiar with your own normal, and getting anything unusual checked out.\n",

            "Paragraph: SAN FRANCISCO -- High in the Sierra Nevada, the Yuba River winds through the northeastern mountains of California. The area, just west of Tahoe National Forest, is home to dense forests, crystal-blue lakes and hills that sparkle with the mineral deposits that gave the area its famous nickname -- Gold Country. The region was the focus of the 1849 Gold Rush, California's great legacy, which led to San Francisco's founding and California's statehood. But the Gold Rush left the state with a darker legacy, as well. In a study published online last week, researchers revealed that mercury from Gold Rush-era mining operations continues to seep into California’s primary water system -- and it may get worse with climate change. \"There’s a tremendous amount of sediment, and the concentrations are so high that it really is scary,\" said the lead author, Michael Singer, a researcher for University of St. Andrews in Scotland and University of California, Santa Barbara. \"This is a problem of DDT proportions,\" he said, referring to the insecticide that inspired Rachel Carson's environmental book Silent Spring. Left from unsafe gold mining practices of the 1800s, the mercury is trapped in sediment in the Sierra Nevada foothills. According to the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, floods continue to force the toxic metal downstream, adding more mercury to the water system. If climate change predictions are correct, floods and the amount of mercury-laden sediment they force into the water system are likely to increase. \"People assume that it’s no longer a problem, that it’s just a matter of cleanup,\" said Singer. \"But we’ve found that new mercury is entering the system and replenishing the supply. Not only is the mercury already in the water system, but it’s continuing to enter it with each major flood.\" Once the mercury enters the water system and gets downstream, some of it converts to methylmercury, a highly toxic substance absorbed by small organisms, and makes its way up the food chain. When consumed in unsafe levels, such as those found in the Sierra Nevada sediment, the contaminant causes mercury poisoning, affecting the nervous system and causing loss of brain function and coordination. Mercury poisoning can also cause reproductive problems, including birth defects and infertility. Downstream from the Sierra Nevada foothills is the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary, the nexus of California’s statewide water system and the largest estuary on the west coasts of both North America and South America. The high content of methylmercury not only threatens the fish that live in the estuary, but also the migratory birds that feed on them. While California has no documented cases of mercury poisoning in humans due to Sierra Nevada contamination, the effects have begun showing up in birds. \"The whole food web is being exposed to this issue,\" said Singer. While Singer's study offers new insight into the extent of the problem, the area’s unusually high levels of mercury already were well known. Since discovering the levels in the 1970s, the state and regional water quality control boards have been aggressively using erosion control, sediment removal and remediation efforts at mining sites. \"People started measuring the mercury levels in fish caught in the area and it was at these really high levels,\" said Mark Stephenson, a researcher with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \"That’s what started all of these programs like Mussel Watch [a contaminant monitoring program]. It really sounded the alarm bell.\" Stephenson has noticed the same conditions Singer described in his paper, and was not surprised by the results, citing climate change as a potential factor that could exacerbate the problem. \"The amount of mercury coming downstream is proportional to the storm. From our research, we’ve found that about 90 percent of the mercury deposits in the past five years came from five major storms -- about one per year,\" Stephenson told HuffPost. \"Some studies have essentially said that due to climate change, infrequent but severe storms are increasing in regularity and intensity. If that’s correct, there will be more mercury mobilized.\" Some policymakers have called the fears overstated. \"After an exhaustive review of all the science surrounding the mercury debate, it is clear that some special-interest groups are crying wolf,\" wrote Richard Pombo, a former state representative, in a 2005 report by the House Resources Committee during the Bush administration. The report was released in anticipation of new regulatory proposals. Representatives from California's mining industry did not deny the mercury problem in a phone call with HuffPost. They urged a look at the bigger picture. \"I'll be the first to say that the mercury is a potential problem,\" said Craig Lindsay, president of Western Mining Alliance. \"But when we're looking at big, complex ecosystems, we need to be careful not to point fingers at just one factor.\" Lindsay said he and other miners have been pulling mercury out of the water long before government agencies took notice. He said he shares Singer's concerns about flooding, but doesn't believe the results are conclusive. \"If you have the flood of the millennium, yeah, there's going to be a lot of mercury moved downstream -- that's a given,\" Lindsay said. \"How that's going to impact the ecosystem in the delta? That's a more complex question.\" High above the delta in Sierra Gold Country, the Nevada Irrigation District has recently completed a pilot project that organizers hope could prevent such a scenario. For the past five years, Rem Scherzinger, general manager of the Nevada Irrigation District, has been working with his team on a program to dredge mercury-laden sediment from the Bear River and Lake Combie, both of which eventually flow into the delta. So far, it’s working. \"The pilot program has been completed with a success rate in the 90th percentile, so we know it’s possible on a small scale,\" Scherzinger said. \"We believe that it could be possible on a large scale, as well.\" But Singer expressed fears that remediation efforts alone are not realistic. \"This is certainly laudable, but it will be much more challenging to do that on a large scale ... this problem is massive,\" Singer said. \"The hills are steep and climate change is calling for flood-like conditions. The mercury is ubiquitous. All it takes is one big flood.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: If everyone around you is staring at their phones lately, they may not just be trying to avoid eye contact — they're probably playing Pokémon Go, the augmented reality iteration of the Pokémon franchise that allows players to find and catch Pokémon in the physical space around them. Now that the craze has arrived, the race is on to find and catch the most valuable Pokémon in the Pokédex — especially the Legendaries, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres and Mewtwo ( ). The Legendary Birds also appear as the mascots for Pokémon Go teams, which seems to indicate that they will make an appearance at some point in the course of the game. But it seems unlikely that the Legendaries will just be hanging around near your house waiting to be caught. Some have speculated that Legendaries will only be available when players come together for meet-ups that will pit teams against each other in large scale Poké-battles. \"It's likely that Niantic has plans to incorporate the Legendary Pokémon into these large events, to encourage players to work together,\" C reported on Friday. \"We saw a hint of this in Nintendo's first trailer for the game, when hundreds of players gathered in Times Square to fight a Mewtwo. After delivering a final blow seconds before a countdown was set to expire, Mewtwo appeared in all of the players' games, a reward similar to the events seen in regular Pokémon games.\" In a 2015 interview about Pokémon Go, Niantic CEO John Hanke said that live events and trading would likely be a big part of the game. \"We'll have events for Pokémon as well,\" Hanke told Venture Beat. Those are competitive, but they can also be places to trade stuff with other players. Pokémon trading is going to be huge. You can't get all of them by yourself. If you want all of them you'll have to trade with other players. Or you have to be someone who takes time off work and travels the world for a year. There may be people who do that. So it may be the case that finding a Legendary Pokémon will require a lot of literal legwork, like traveling to meet-ups or crossing the ocean. Or you can just wait for the moment when someone inevitably comes up with a game hack.\n",

Dion Parratt is one such former addict, who used to knock back five cans of the stuff per day at the hight of her obsession. Dion says her former addiction has led to a serious heart condition, and also attributes her two miscarriages to the drinks. In a post which has since been made private, Dion shared an image of herself strapped up to her heart monitoring machine, which she has to wear for 24 hours a day.

            "Paragraph: The last time you stayed at a hotel, did you give any thought to the soap? It might not have occurred to you how much soap can go to waste every single day in a hotel or motel. Perhaps you unwrapped a bar and used it once, only to find it replaced later with a freshly wrapped bar. That's a lot of soap going down the drain. A couple of hotel maids in Florida realized the amount of soap going on the garbage heap at the end of every day was ridiculous. They decided to take advice from an old adage: waste not, want not. With that, they started an initiative to Clean the World. Clean the World is an organization that collects used bars of soap from hotels and recycles them into fresh new bars. The little soap leftovers from some 4,000 hotels world-wide are melted down, sanitized, formed into bars and repackaged. Now, instead of wasting away in a landfill, they are saving lives in third world nations. In many poor and struggling nations, people die every day of infections and illnesses that could have been prevented with basic sanitary conditions. The bars from Clean the World are shipped to these nations and distributed to people who need them most. To date, more than 25 million bars have been handed out. Next time you’re going on a trip, ask your hotel if they participate in Clean the World; if they don’t, tell them why they should.\n",

            "Paragraph: A still from the 1984 music video \"Forever Young.\" RIP 1984. (YouTube) Midlife crises are tricky things to measure. I mean, you can’t exactly vacuum up all the data on 50-year-old men buying Camaros or middle-aged moms dropping in for Botox. But Spotify, the streaming music juggernaut, can track the music that people listen to at every age — a pretty solid indicator of their cultural tastes. And in a new analysis of that data, Spotify found that there’s a specific point when middle-aged listeners drop their sophisticated singer-songwriters, their \"best of the 80s, 90s and today,\" and spontaneously start listening to teeny-bopper pop again. That age is — drumroll, please — 42. (Forty-somethings in the audience: This one goes out to you.) Admittedly, the exact age of the average midlife crisis isn’t exactly mind-blowing research. But there’s more where that came from: By analyzing user data, Spotify has also nailed down the listening patterns people adopt over their lifetimes. Listeners become less interested in popular music over time — until that little dip, circa age 42. (Spotify) Young adults and 20-somethings, for instance, tend to stick to what’s on the top charts: your T Swifts, your Wiz Khalifas. During their 20s, however, most people — particularly men — start listening to less and less mainstream music as they explore artists and genres outside FM radio and as they return to the artists they liked growing up. By 35, most adults have stopped keeping up with whatever the hot new thing on MTV is. But at 42, there’s a sharp regression: a return to pop music that doesn’t quite dissipate until the mid-40s. And it can’t be blamed on parents listening to their kids’ music, either — parents actually never have that little backwards-looking interest in pop music. This is all a very good reminder not only that the Cool Dad archetype has some basis in reality, but also that Spotify is less a music company than a data one: Like all of the other major music-streaming platforms, its future lies in its ability to measure and predict your tastes better than anyone else. To that end, Spotify acquired the \"music intelligence\" service Echo Nest in March of last year — this latest research was actually conducted by a former Echo Nest-er. Spotify can now pinpoint, among many, many other things, the exact sections of songs that listeners like most, the differing schedules of fans in New York and Laredo, and the exact songs a 55-year-old will want on his running playlist, versus a 25-year-old. Spotify is far from the only company vying for data dominance here: Pandora employs a team of more than 80 curators, analysts and scientists solely for the purpose of perfecting personalization; Songza, which Google acquired last year, mines everything from the user’s location to the current weather when recommending playlists. (Wrote the Guardian’s Stuart Dredge last July: \"Never underestimate the importance of data in a Google acquisition.\") With all this research and data, perhaps the big question is: Why isn’t music personalization, well — any more accurate? You’d think that, if Spotify can predict what jazz tracks a 13-year-old girl will like most, they could also figure out that I never, under any circumstance, want to hear Jason Derulo. It turns out that, for now, at least, algorithms can’t perfectly replicate the whims and weirdnesses of human taste. There’s just too much that data doesn’t capture: your mood, the relative loudness of the Metro, that bad teenage association you still have with \"Bright Eyes.\" Brian Whitman, Spotify’s \"principal music scientist,\" once mocked the very idea of a computer understanding complex human feelings: It’s \"postmodern insanity,\" he claimed. And yet, thanks to the efforts of Whitman and his colleagues, that insanity becomes more real with each passing day! Just ask all the 42-year-olds jamming, on Spotify’s recommendation, to Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande.\n",

The princess of Monaco is the latest cover star of Tatler, with one of her most iconic photos peering back at readers of the December 2013 issue.

            "Paragraph: I was in high school when Alicia Keys' \"Fallin'\" came out. It was everywhere and with her debut album release, Songs in A Minor, she became the best-selling new artist of 2001 and a GRAMMY Award winner. Keys' subsequent releases made her a living legend, and arguably, one of the most talented and powerful artists to ever live. She can sing anything, look good doing it and with two episodes of \"The Voice\" under her belt, she's also proving she might be the most sincere and humble GRAMMY winner to ever live. As Keys heard the first few bars of her \"If I Ain't Got You,\" being sung behind her, everything changed-- her face lit up, but not in the \"can you believe someone is singing my song right here, right now?\" No, it was more of a honor for her, she couldn't wait to hear what Lauren Diaz was going to do with her 2004 hit. Giphy In less than 30 seconds, Keys had heard all she needed to hear. She pressed that button and spent the next 2 minutes cheering on Diaz as she powered through the song. And this isn't just any song, Keys won a GRAMMY for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance for \"If I Ain't Got You.\" When the song was over, Keys marched up to the stage, hugged Diaz and said, \"wow.\" The audience had learned before the performance that Diaz grew up idolizing Keys, but the other coaches still put up a decent fight to get her to join their teams. After pitches from Miley Cyrus, a poem from Adam Levine, and a great talk from Blake Shelton, Keys was back. And what did she do? Keys sang the song back to her. After she said, \"can you just tell me a little bit about yourself?\" Yes, that's right, Keys, 15-time GRAMMY winner sang the song back to her. And with that 30-second performance, Keys changed \"The Voice.\" And, maybe, I teared up.\n",

The artificial leg given to him by his German rescuers had a double-wheel structure that made it difficult to turn corners, according the Local. But one of his veterinarians found a positively charming solution -- he fitted Schildi with a single Lego wheel leg. Dr. Panagiotis Azmanis, of a veterinary called Bird Consulting International, came up with the idea, and found the Lego piece after raiding a co-worker's daughter's toy box, according to Bild.de. Now, with his new Lego leg, Schildi is back on the move, recovering at an animal rescue and \"doing really well again.\" \"We will see him again once in a while for check-ups,\" Azmanis told the Local. \"If he gets a 'flat tire' it will be a simple matter to replace the wheel. They move around quite a lot so I'd expect to see him for a new wheel about once a year.\" We're dying from the cuteness.\n",

            "Paragraph: Synthetic cannabis products like \"Kronic,\" \" Spice \" and \" K2 \" are flooding the market, offering a cheaper (and legal) way to get high. The problem: They're disturbingly bad for you — way more hazardous than the real thing. A new study from Tel Aviv University found that synthetic cannabis users — compared to users of regular cannabis — in psychiatric centers tended to be younger men, showed more severe psychotic symptoms, stayed hospitalized longer, had a previous record of being hospitalized and were more likely to be hospitalized by criminal court order. The study looked at patients of mental health centers between October 2007 and May 2014 who self-reported using synthetic cannabis or had a positive urine test for marijuana when they were admitted to the hospital. The study group was relatively small — 60 self-reported synthetic cannabis smokers, 163 non-synthetic users — but made a clear point: The man-made version of marijuana is a wrecking ball in your brain and could land you in psychiatric care. But that shouldn't be shocking at all. A man lies handcuffed and unconscious in Dallas. Police say he had been smoking synthetic marijuana called K2 Source: LM Otero/AP nd poison control centers took 2,487 more calls regarding synthetic weed than in the first five months of the previous year .

Pair those results with the ones found by Tel Aviv researchers, and you have a clear sense of K2's health risks. The verdict: Stay the hell away from synthetic dope.

            "Paragraph: Most of us probably don't even know we're failing this daily task, yet it may be seriously affecting our health. Less than 4 per cent of Australians are eating enough vegetables and legumes each day and most are failing to meet the minimum number of serves recommended for the five major food groups, a new report has found. And it's even worse among Australians aged 18 and younger - fewer than half a per cent are eating the recommended minimum for vegetables, according to the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey 2011-12, released by the Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday. The report is part of Australia's largest health survey and the first to compare food consumption against the Australian Dietary Guidelines. \"It's getting worse,\" said nutritionist Lucinda Hancock, from Nutrition Australia, citing previous results that showed about seven per cent of adults were meeting the recommended intake for vegetables. \"The way our society is now, we've got so many junk foods out there, so many packaged foods ... Actually making the healthy choice is quite difficult.\" More than one third of Australians' daily energy intake comes from 'junk food' such as sweetened beverages, alcohol, cakes, confectionary and pastry products, the report found. Australians fell furthest from the mark when it came to vegetables and legumes, with fewer than one in 25 Australians meeting the minimum recommended number of serves. Only one in 10 eat enough dairy, while one in seven meet the guidelines for lean meats and alternatives. Australians came closest to fulfilling the recommendations for fruit and grains, with one in three meeting the guidelines in each food group. \"However, one-third of the fruit serves was from juice and dried fruit, and two-thirds of the grains and cereals were from refined grains rather than whole grain or high fibre sources,\" said ABS director of health Louise Gates. The Australian Dietary Guidelines, established in 2013, have not been well communicated to the public, said Stephen Colagiuri, from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity at the University of Sydney. \"This report basically underlines that we're not getting the message across. We need to help people to better understand the food that they're eating,\" Professor Colagiuri said, adding that most Australians would probably be surprised to find they were not meeting dietary recommendations. \"There is a disconnect with weight - much of which is determined by what you eat - and the vast array of health consequences that can occur. Especially in the younger age group, their motivation for doing anything about weight is mostly cosmetic rather than for health reasons,\" he said. \"While it's not all that easy to reduce one's weight, what we're really hoping is to prevent the weight gain ... That in itself would have a significant impact on the amount of chronic disease we have.\" Ms Hancock said public health initiatives hadn't done enough to make healthy foods the easiest choice in terms of convenience, availability and cost. \"It's all well and good to tell people to follow the dietary guidelines but that message needs to be supported in the entire environment,\" she said. For example, vending machines, convenience stores and food outlets should be encouraged to have easily identifiable healthy food options. The 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend adults eat at least six serves of grain foods, 5-6 serves of vegetables, two serves of fruit, 2.5 serves of dairy products and about three serves of lean meat and alternatives per day, depending on age and gender.\n",

            "Paragraph: Some things are stranger than the movies. Since 2002, the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC, has housed the world’s largest collection actual gadgets, historical items, and memorabilia pertaining to the dangerous world of international espionage. From lipstick pistols to dog poop listening devices, here’s a look at some of the most bizarre and fascinating items currently on display. 1. Buttonhole camera, model F-21, circa 1970 Known by the codename \"Ajax,\" this hidden camera was concealed within a regular coat and was widely used in the Soviet Union, Europe, and the US. The camera’s trigger was held in the pocket, and when activated, would snap a picture from a lens that resembled a button. 2. Dog poop transmitter, circa 1970 This hidden transmitter was disguised by the one thing nobody wants to touch — poop. This device was issued by CIA during the 1970s and transmitted a radio signal to coordinate airstrikes and reconnaissance. 3. Eyeglasses with concealed cyanide pills, circa 1975–1977 Not all covert operations go according to plan. In the case of compromised mission, a CIA agent choosing death over torture could remove their eyeglasses and chew on the arm to release a powerful dose of cyanide. 4. Lipstick Pistol, circa 1965 This ordinary looking lipstick was designed and used by the KGB during the Cold War and was capable of firing a deadly .177-caliber round. 5. Tree stump listening device, early 1970s Designed by the CIA, this tree stump would be placed near a Soviet base and used to intercept secret radio transmissions. The data would be relayed back to the CIA via satellite. 6. Rectal tool kit, 1960s Utilized by the CIA, this compact tool kit was designed to be hidden inside an agent’s anus to be undetectable during a pat down. 7. Pigeon camera, 1916–1917 This German pigeon camera was used during WWI for reconnaissance on enemy positions. The camera was placed on a timer and the birds were set free to fly over the battleground. Upon returning, the film was processed and the data collected was implemented into real-time combat strategies. 8. Explosive water canteen, 1942–1945 During World War II, some US Army intelligence officials carried this canteen which contained explosives in the lower portion of the container. 9. Explosive coal and camouflage, circa 1942–1945 This lump of coal was created by the United States OSS during World War II. Within its hollow center was an explosive, while a camouflage kit was also provided to paint the lump in the exact color of the local coal. If unsuspecting enemy personnel were to toss it into a fire, the coal would detonate. 10. Flashlight gun, 1930s Little is known about which agency developed this tool, which featured a working flashlight and functioning firearm. 11. Hollow coin, 1950s–1990s Hollow coins are quite prevalent in espionage, offering a clandestine storage for microdots and microfilm. The coin is opened by inserting a needle into a tiny hole on the face of the coin. 12. Shoe with heel transmitter, 1960s–1970s This shoe was stolen from a US diplomat by the Romanian Secret Service and outfitted with a hidden microphone and transmitter. 13. Steineck ABC wristwatch camera, circa 1949 Developed in West Germany, this tiny camera was situated on an agent’s wrist and was capable of snapping eight photos. Since the camera didn’t come equipped with a viewfinder, framing a good shot was quite a difficult task. 14. Tessina camera and cigarette case concealment, 1960s What at first glance looks to be a fancy pack of cigarettes, was actually a hidden camera developed by the German Stasi during the 1960s. An operative was able to grab a real smoke and covertly snap pictures at the same time. This gun was developed by the US Office of Naval Intelligence and designed to be triggered by pushing the top plunger into the enemy. 16. Tobacco pipe pistol, 1939–1945 Developed by the British Special Forces, this firearm was designed to appear as an ordinary pipe, but packed a deadly secret. 17. Lockpick pen, 1970s This pen was issued by US Intelligence and contained all the tools necessary to pick a standard door lock. 18. Escape boots, 1939–1945 These clever boots were worn by British MI9 pilots, and with their tops cut off, would help downed pilots blend into the local populations. 19. Gas assassination weapon, 1950s Developed by the KGB, this weapon was used by Soviet agent Bogdan Stashinsky to assassinate two Ukranian dissidents by disguising it within a rolled-up newspaper. 20. Key Casting Kit, 1960s This kit was issued to CIA operatives and designed to duplicate keys by making an impression in putty and then casting a mold of the original. 21. Time-delay pencils, 1943-1945 Issued by the US Office of Strategic Services during World War II, this gadget disguised as a pack of pencils contained a time-delay incendiary device, which allowed the operator to escape to safety before detonation.\n",

            "Paragraph: Some successful people always knew what they wanted to do and had a plan. From a young age, they methodically plotted their way up the ladder. You look at their career path, and where they started — and where they ended — makes total sense. There are many people who have become wildly successful whose careers had unexpected, even weird starts. They may have stumbled onto their vocations. Or they always had a passion — but found a very unorthodox way of finding their routes to achieving their dreams. Take Jonathan Goldsmith, the actor who plays the \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" character in commercials for Dos Equis. After first moving to Los Angeles, he worked on a garbage truck, according to an NPR interview. He lied his way into westerns, pretending to know how to ride a horse, and eventually played villains, even though he had always wanted to do comedy. He finally got a chance, decades after starting acting and while trying to refresh his movie career by auditioning for a commercial by imitating his sailing buddy, Fernando Lamas. \"It only took 50 years,\" Goldsmith said. \"An overnight success.\" Even CEOs and power brokers have had unconventional starts. Andrew Carnegie’s first job was as a 13-year-old textile worker. John D. Rockefeller was an accountant. Tim Armstrong, AOL’s CEO before the acquisition by Verizon, was a teacher. So, if you’re one of the millions of newly-minted college graduates not sure of what’s next– or the parent of one — take heart. There are many paths to business in success. Here are some of the more unusual stories of people who started in non-traditional beginnings and yet rose to high-profile positions that brought them wealth and fame. Kat Cole Position: CEO of Cinnabon Unusual start: Hooters girl As a teenager, she wanted to be a corporate lawyer and needed to save for college. So, at age 17, she became a hostess at a local Hooters and then, when she turned 18, a waitress — a Hooters girl. But she was a go-getter and by 19 was asked by the company to travel to different countries to help open foreign markets. At 23, she was in charge of global training for employees and managers. She never finished the bachelor’s degree, although eventually she got her MBA. \"I was lucky that Hooters wasn’t a more sophisticated company, because there’s no way someone my age would have had those chances,\" she said. \"It wasn’t like people graduating from Ivy League schools were dying to get a corporate job at Hooters.\" Richard Branson Position: Founder and Chairman, Virgin Group Unusual Start: Hit record producer Branson started a magazine when he was only 16, but really set off his career as an entrepreneur at 22 when he opened a recording studio and brought in singer Mike Oldfield. The result was a single called \"Tubular Bells,\" which stayed on the U.K. charts for close to five years. \"On the back of that, we built a record company, and one thing led to another,\" he told BusinessInsider. Mark Cuban Position: Owner, Dallas Mavericks, Co-owner, Wagner/Cuban Companies, Chairman and CEO of AXS tv, investor Unusual Start: Disco dancing instructor Mark Cuban was an entrepreneur from his early years, when he sold garbage bags to pay for basketball shoes when he was 12. He started a number of businesses when a student at Indiana University, but the most colorful had to be teaching disco dancing. \"If you get asked by a bunch of sorority girls to come to a sorority house to teach girls how to dance for $25 an hour, you do it,\" he told the Wall Street Journal. Steve Jobs Position: Late CEO, Apple Unusual Start: Selling illegal telephone hacking equipment In the 1970s, telephone systems were far different than today. They used tone signals to control long-distance dialing. Jobs and his friend and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, had their first business: illegally selling so-called blue boxes that would allow people to break into the telephone system and make free calls. \"If it hadn’t been for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple,\" he said in a 1994 video interview. \"I’m 100 percent sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.\" Les Moonves Position: CEO, CBS Unusual Start: Acting Before he got into the production end of the business, Moonves was a struggling actor in New York. After playing a few small tough guy rolls in such series as the \"Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"Cannon,\" he gave up acting and switched careers. \"I was mediocre,\" he told Fortune. Sumner Redstone Position:  Chairman, Viacom and CBS Unusual Start: Spy During the Second World War, Redstone was part of an intelligence unit responsible for breaking the communications codes of the Japanese, which meant learning the language and culture. \"The work was so intensive that at some point I knew the meaning of more Japanese [pictogram] characters than the average Japanese on the street,\" he wrote in his 2001 biography, A Passion to Win. \"Breaking the Japanese code was one of the turning points of the war and I was proud to have made a small contribution to the effort.\" However, he found it \"tragic and unfair\" that Japanese-American citizens, most of whom \"must have been extremely loyal citizens,\" were not allowed in the facilities, which also slowed progress.\n",

            "Topic: Here's How Much Snapchat Is Now Reportedly Valued At\n",
            "Paragraph: It should come to no surprise that users are obsessed with Snapchat. Once just a small startup, the company has grown to be one of most popular messaging apps available. And as much as its users believe in it, investors do too, which is why they haven't been shy about helping with funding. Unlike messages on the platform, the money won't be disappearing any time soon. Snapchat is now looking to raise about $200 million in new funding, which means that the company can be worth a pretty penny if investors help it out. This new round of funding is an extension of the Series F round from March, where Snapchat raised $175 million from Fidelity. This fundraising gave the company a valuation of $16 billion. According to VC Experts, if Snapchat is able to raise its desired $200 million the company will then be valued at $22.7 billion. Of course this is just an estimate since this valuation is based on the fact that Snapchat would remain $30.72 per share. It would also mean that Snapchat has raised a total of more than $1.5 billon in funding. While this large valuation reveals Snapchat's success, it could also make it harder for another company to acquire it in the future the more expensive it becomes. Facebook attempted to do exactly this when it tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion back in 2013. Snapchat continues to be privately owned Popular among teens, Snapchat has exploded as of late. The company continues to roll out new features like giant stickers, one-handed zooming for iOS, new filters almost on the daily, voice calls and audio and video messaging. Snapchat is also reportedly revamping its Discover section next month, which will include a new layout that won't feature those circular icons that it currently has. The app's CEO Evan Spiegel revealed earlier this year that it has more than 100 million daily users. With its large user base and investors constantly taking a bite out of the fundraising pie, it's safe to say Snapchat as we know it will be sticking around for some time.

            "Paragraph: As an added bonus, men don't need a fashion degree to make the trend work for them. There are virtually no rules when it comes to socks, so bold colors and patterns with a suit or casual wear work no matter what else you're wearing on top or bottom. It's not just specific retailers cashing in on the sock craze anymore. \"Early on you could really find novelty socks (only) in some of the better specialty and department stores, but over the past years, the reason why it's grown is because you can get them anywhere from Target to the department stores. It's now become a very commercialized commodity item,\" said Cohen. But there still are plenty of boutiques and specialty online retailers that specialize only in selling socks. BoldSocks.com is one example. The online retailer was started in 2011 as a fun competition between friends Ryan Preisner and Adam Whitmore. At the time, they didn't expect to have a brilliant business plan on their hands, but they have since expanded to two brands, Statement Sockwear and BoldSocks, as a way to keep up with consumer demand for socks with unique patterns and colors. \"Our first year's sales, in most people's minds, were quite pathetic, but we have seen nonstop growth ever since. Our forecasted sales this year will likely exceed 26,000 percent growth over our first year's sales,\" said Ryan Roff, co-founder of Statement Sockwear.\n",

            "Topic: Gap InternationalVoice: What Every CEO Should Know About Organic Growth\n",
            "Paragraph: By Natalie Burg Hewlett-Packard was a business born of and built on innovation. The tech company is among those famous early Silicon Valley businesses founded by a couple of brilliant guys tinkering in a garage. New ideas continued to drive its growth   until they didn't. Organic growth keeps companies on the cutting edge, forcing them to continuously improve. More than a decade ago, Hewlett-Packard focused its expansion efforts on acquisitions, at the expense of investing in R&D. The company's subsequent struggles, noted observers, could be traced to the decision to stop innovating. There's nothing wrong with acquisitions or mergers, said Pontish Yeramyan, founder and CEO of performance consulting firm Gap International. The problem is when it becomes the only way to grow. Why Organic Growth Matters Organic growth keeps companies on the cutting edge, forcing them to continuously improve   whether that's adjusting their vision, innovating the business model or developing new products and services. It makes you more tuned in with the changing marketplace, Yeramyan said. You get more focused on what you want to do and how you want to lead the market. You end up getting caught off guard much less than companies focused on just getting bigger, being more efficient and delivering short-term results. Take the hotel industry. A decade ago hotels were just being hotels, Yeramyan said. They were growing the way they knew how: buying and merging with other hotels. Then Airbnb came along, reinventing the way people travel and disrupting the entire industry. It's becoming a familiar story. While legacy businesses are busy gobbling up smaller companies, some startup comes along and challenges their entire business model. A new survey of global executives by Forbes Insights and Gap International shows 57 percent of business leaders name startups as their biggest competitors. Leaders of established companies might worry less about being disrupted by a startup if they focused more on organic growth. When you're connected to organic growth and your passion is about growth, then you're busy innovating and being in front of the marketplace, rather than being victimized by change, Yeramyan said. When people connect to a passion for organic growth, it creates alignment and brings out the brilliance in employees, which, in turn, promotes more growth, according to Yeramyan. That's how organizations can produce the next Airbnb-like idea   rather than being caught off guard when it emerges. You become the changer, rather than the changee, she said. Breaking The Frame The Forbes Insights report found that 70 percent of respondents are extremely or somewhat concerned about whether their company will still be relevant and competitive in two years. Despite that deep concern, most business leaders unknowingly limit their thinking when it comes to organic growth. They tend to operate from fixed assumptions about how their marketplace works, viewing the world through what Yeramyan calls a frame. According to Yeramyan, people don't know they're always operating inside a frame because they see it as a fixed reality, as just the way it is. Because they don't think they're in a frame, they can't challenge it, she said. Commoditized products are a great example. It may be challenging for a leader of a commoditized business to create growth when margins are disappearing or demand for their product is down. Because their frame is we are a commodity business that can only compete on price, it's not obvious that there is another way to compete. Organic growth becomes possible when leaders can break themselves and their businesses out of that frame. They might say, 'Maybe we don't have to be a commodity; maybe something else is possible,' Yeramyan said. A bottle of water and a cup of coffee used to be commodities, until someone came along and decided to compete on something other than price. Tactics to create organic growth could include finding new kinds of customers, developing new products and services, or innovating internal processes   even how you build employees' capabilities to execute. It could be virtually anything. Once you break out of your frame, that's the fun part, Yeramyan said. Making It Happen When business leaders open their minds to new ways of growing, the stage may be set for organic growth, but the play hasn't even started yet. Yeramyan highlights three critical actions leaders must take to create sustainable growth from the inside: Get On The Same Page Organizations grow when all employees work together to achieve the same end. This happens only when leaders clarify and articulate their vision, and get everyone aligned on a plan to execute it. Too often, leaders share their vision and people nod their heads, and leaders think they have been understood. Then team members go off and execute in a way they think fulfills the leader's intention, but end up going in a very different direction. Leaders may have a whole different picture in their heads that their people can't understand unless they fully articulate it. Then, and only then, can an organization move forward together to execute a plan that realizes the vision. Break Down Silos The benefits of an entire organization working toward a common vision can be reached only when everyone is working in harmony. Yet invisible silos and legacy systems often keep departments, offices and divisions from collaborating. A whole new corporate culture may be required. But the rewards of true collaboration and cooperation   increases in the quality and speed of work   are well worth the effort. Grow People To Grow The Business An organization grows when its people grow. People grow when challenges require them to. But to push people to reach out of their comfort zones, the challenges can't be perfunctory. For organizations to be leading-edge, leaders, front-line staff and everyone in between must be challenged to deliver far beyond what they think they can. Achieving organic growth may take time and require investment and culture change, but according to the experts at Gap International, there can be no real, sustainable success without it.

            "Paragraph: Toxic people defy logic. Some are blissfully unaware of the negative impact that they have on those around them, and others seem to derive satisfaction from creating chaos and pushing other people's buttons. Either way, they create unnecessary complexity, strife, and worst of all stress. Studies have long shown that stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the brain. Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of neurons in the hippocampus an important brain area responsible for reasoning and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to neuronal dendrites (the small arms that brain cells use to communicate with each other), and months of stress can permanently destroy neurons. Stress is a formidable threat to your success when stress gets out of control, your brain and your performance suffer. Most sources of stress at work are easy to identify. If your non-profit is working to land a grant that your organization needs to function, you're bound to feel stress and likely know how to manage it. It's the unexpected sources of stress that take you by surprise and harm you the most. Recent research from the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at Friedrich Schiller University in Germany found that exposure to stimuli that cause strong negative emotions the same kind of exposure you get when dealing with toxic people caused subjects' brains to have a massive stress response. Whether it's negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome, or just plain craziness, toxic people drive your brain into a stressed-out state that should be avoided at all costs. The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we've found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize toxic people. Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ to keep toxic people at bay. While I've run across numerous effective strategies that successful people employ when dealing with toxic people, what follows are twelve of the best. To deal with toxic people effectively, you need an approach that enables you, across the board, to control what you can and eliminate what you can't. The important thing to remember is that you are in control of far more than you realize. They Set Limits (Especially with Complainers) Complainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don't want to be seen as callous or rude, but there's a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral. The Forbes eBook Of Motivational Quotes  Discover the timeless advice that the world's great thinkers, billionaires, writers and businesspeople have to offer. You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. Think of it this way: if the complainer were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You'd distance yourself, and you should do the same with complainers. A great way to set limits is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction. They Don't Die in the Fight Successful people know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you're able to choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right. They Rise Above Toxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. Which begs the question, why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix? The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. Distance yourself from them emotionally and approach your interactions like they're a science project (or you're their shrink, if you prefer the analogy). You don't need to respond to the emotional chaos only the facts. They Stay Aware of Their Emotions Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can't stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don't recognize when it's happening. Sometimes you'll find yourself in situations where you'll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine and you shouldn't be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so. Think of it this way if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he's John F. Kennedy, you're unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it's best to just smile and nod. If you're going to have to straighten them out, it's better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it. They Establish Boundaries This is the area where most people tend to sell themselves short. They feel like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn't be further from the truth. Once you've found your way to Rise Above a person, you'll begin to find their behavior more predictable and easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when you don't. For example, even if you work with someone closely on a project team, that doesn't mean that you need to have the same level of one-on-one interaction with them that you have with other team members. You can establish a boundary, but you'll have to do so consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you are bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you'll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them, which they will. They Won't Let Anyone Limit Their Joy When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from the opinions of other people, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel good about something that they've done, they won't let anyone's opinions or snide remarks take that away from them. While it's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don't have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what toxic people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain you're never as good or bad as they say you are. They Don't Focus on Problems Only Solutions Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems you're facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress. When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you're going to go about handling them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them. They Don't Forget Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn't mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what's happened so that you can move on. It doesn't mean you'll give a wrongdoer another chance. Successful people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others' mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm. They Squash Negative Self-Talk Sometimes you absorb the negativity of other people. There's nothing wrong with feeling bad about how someone is treating you, but your self-talk (the thoughts you have about your feelings) can either intensify the negativity or help you move past it. Negative self-talk is unrealistic, unnecessary, and self-defeating. It sends you into a downward emotional spiral that is difficult to pull out of. You should avoid negative self-talk at all costs. They Limit Their Caffeine Intake Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the fight-or-flight response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you're surprised in the hallway by an angry coworker. They Get Some Sleep I've beaten this one to death over the years and can't say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day's memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don't get enough or the right kind of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. A good night's sleep makes you more positive, creative, and proactive in your approach to toxic people, giving you the perspective you need to deal effectively with them. They Use Their Support System It's tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can't because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation.  Before you get this system to work brilliantly, you're going to have to pass some tests. Most of the time, you will find yourself tested by touchy interactions with problem people. Thankfully, the plasticity of the brain allows it to mold and change as you practice new behaviors, even when you fail. Implementing these healthy, stress-relieving techniques for dealing with difficult people will train your brain to handle stress more effectively and decrease the likelihood of ill effects.

            "Paragraph: With its fantastical realms and motley cast of supernatural miscreants, World of Warcraft broke new ground in multiplayer online role-playing computer games, and has now spawned the most successful computer game movie adaptation of all time. After its second weekend at the box office, Warcraft: The Beginning has recouped $377.6 million globally, despite bombing in the U.S. The movie received a meager 32% on metacritic.com and took just $24.4 million in its first five days in American cinemas, and dropped a whopping 73% on its second weekend, bringing in a paltry $6.5 million. Yet the movie remains a financial triumph almost entirely owed to its showing in China, where cinema-goers have so far shelled out more than $200 million on it, even eclipsing Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which took $125.4 million in its entire run in China. Movie experts hail Warcraft’s success as demonstrating the power of China’s booming cinema. Box office revenues grew by almost 50% in China last year and may even surpass the U.S. by as early as next year. There are plans afoot to double the nation’s 35,000 cinema screens before long. (The U.S. currently has just over 40,000.) This trend has the potential to radically reshape how Hollywood operates. But while there is no denying the burgeoning power of Chinese film fans, assessing Warcraft’s success requires more nuance. Just like in the U.S., the movie dropped off massively after its opening — netting $156 million over its first five days and the next $40 million-odd over spread over more than a week. That suggests that the Warcraft movie may not have broad appeal among Chinese; instead, its success appears to be largely owed to the nation’s sizeable and dedicated gamer following. \"I have watch the Warcraft movie five times, and I will never forget my obsession and my friends who fought by my side in Warcraft,\" posted one user of China’s Twitter-like microblog Weibo. \"I had fun, also lost myself in World of Warcraft. I have lived in one more world than most people.\" Since its launch in 2004, WoW, as it’s better known to fans, has drawn over 100 million players — a record for a role-playing computer game. Half of the current five-million-strong playing roster resides in China, where the game is aptly know as \"World of Magic Beasts.\" They are typically young men aged 15-25. \"I can still remember me and my roommates in college staying up late and playing Warcraft together,\" posted another fan. \"We were really bonding through this game. The success of Warcraft is not because how good the movie is, but it represents the years of our burning passions, and the unforgettable brotherhood.\" died after a marathon, 19-hour session. WoW is so popular that there are Chinese kids regularly get so hooked on WoW that they forget to eat, drink or sleep — one player evenafter a marathon, 19-hour session. WoW is so popular that there are professional players who are treated like movie stars, complete with sponsorship deals with fawning groupies. There are Chinese boot camps set up especially for kids who suffer from role-player game addiction. This obsession with role-playing escapism could have much to do with the highly regimented lives led by middle-class Chinese kids, who cope with enormous pressure. Due to China’s only recently rescinded One-Child Policy , many are only children, and are solely relied upon to support their aging parents and grandparents. This month, 9.4 million Chinese kids took the gaokao — China’s university entrance exam equivalent to America’s SAT — yet there were only 3 million college places up for grabs, and only a small fraction of those were at \"top-tier\" institutions. Exam-related suicide is so common that one school even installed special barriers to prevent students flinging themselves to their deaths. Adulthood doesn’t bring respite. Deviant behavior massively jeopardizes career advancement in a one-party state where every citizen has a dangan, or personal file, that lists their misdeeds from their entry into public life — typically enrollment at elementary school — until their death. In this suffocating world, WoW’s appeal is in having complete, uncompromising control over a fantasy, where a player can be as brazen, shocking and nonconformist as their imaginations can stretch. \"Even though young [Chinese] people would like to care about political and historical issues, their choices are limited,\" Zhou Xiaozheng, a retired professor of sociology at Beijing’s Renmin University, tells TIME. \"So they indulge themselves in entertainment.\"\n",

It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.\" People on the internet quickly concluded that Swift was talking about Perry, who, soon after that interview was published, tweeted, \"Watch out for the Regina George in sheep’s clothing.\" Perry all but confirmed the tweet was about Swift when she told Billboard in 2015, \"If somebody is trying to defame my character, you’re going to hear about it.\" Swift’s ex Calvin Harris also confirmed the feud between the pop stars when he tweeted about it after his messy breakup from the \"22\" singer. \"I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,\" Harris wrote, adding, \"I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it.\" Perry seemingly responded to the DJ with a very telling GIF of Hillary Clinton. She also retweeted one of her old tweets that read, \"Time, the ultimate truth teller.\"\n",

            "Topic: The Huge Thing Holding Women Back From Equality We Should Be Talking About\n",
            "Paragraph: When we think about the things holding women back from full equality in this country, maternity leave might not be the first thing to come to mind. But for me, and thousands of other women like me, it is the reason we have to work harder to be able to earn, succeed, and claim our power like men can. Two years ago, I was working as the director of operations of a research institute at a major university while finishing my MBA in the evenings. When I got pregnant, I assumed combining motherhood with my professional life would be easy. I also assumed I would have access to paid maternity leave.  While I had worked full-time for over two years, I was originally hired as a consultant and had only been an official employee for 23 months — one month shy of qualifying for six weeks paid leave. In this, I was far from alone: just another one of the 88% of women in the U.S. who don’t have access to paid maternity leave.  When I got pregnant, I assumed combining motherhood with my professional life would be easy. I also assumed I would have access to paid maternity leave. I was, however, entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). I was lucky. Approximately 60% of employees — those who work full-time for at least one year for a company with at least 50 staff members — are eligible for unpaid leave. The remaining 40% are not guaranteed any time off, paid or unpaid. Not even one single day to give birth. I worked for a professor who travelled frequently and whom I rarely saw in person. Many of our staff members were located at campuses abroad, and much of our work was done via Skype. I had worked remotely from rural Ghana many times before, and could have easily worked from my apartment. When I first discussed flexible working and telecommuting, my boss was open to the idea. As my due date neared, he changed his mind. I started to visit day care centers in Manhattan, and was shocked to learn that monthly rates were anywhere from $1,900 to $2,900. In fact, in 28 states and the District of Columbia, the average annual cost for an infant in day care is higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college.  Fees for two children in day care are higher than the average annual rent in every state. I added my name to a number of waitlists, and was eventually offered a part-time place at one center. My boss still would not consider a flexible work schedule, and my daughter, now 2 years old, is still waiting on that full-time list. I worked until my water broke, trying to save the little paid sick and vacation time that I had. After 23 hours of labor, my daughter was born via an emergency c-section. I took my baby home and was grateful that I at least had the time to recover. Giving birth is a physically grueling event, and too many women are forced to go back to work while they’re still bleeding, have stitches, and can barely walk. I worked until my water broke, trying to save the little paid sick and vacation time that I had. Over the next 12 weeks, I had regular panic attacks at the thought of handing my baby over to strangers. At three months, she wasn’t sleeping through the night, had only had one round of vaccines, was nursing every hour, and still very much needed me. As much as I loved my job, I chose to resign.  In that, too, I was far from alone. For the first time since the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s, the share of mothers who choose to stay at home rather than return to work after their children are born has been increasing — it has now reached 29%. While 71 countries provide paid paternity leave, there are only two countries that don’t offer any paid federal maternity leave: the United States and Papua New Guinea.  Like many women who find themselves stifled by this country's inflexible work options, I wanted to work. But I couldn’t justify leaving my infant. So, when my daughter was a year old, I finished my MBA, left the city, and moved my family to Long Island, so we could be closer to my mom, who was able to help out. We knew we wanted to have another baby but still wouldn’t be able to afford to spend $5,000 a month on day care. I also still wouldn’t be ready to leave our second baby at just 12 weeks. I was terrified that I was giving up my career that I worked so hard to build terrified that I wouldn’t be able to find consulting work from home, that there would be a break in my résumé. I was worried that I would eventually be \"mommy-tracked,\" viewed only as someone’s mommy, rather than as a serious professional. While staying home with our daughter — and now infant son — was the best decision I could have made, I still lost out financially. I was lucky enough to find consulting work from home in my field, and I can run down from my office to nurse my babies anytime my mother calls, but I lost retirement contributions, paid sick and vacation leave, as well as the social aspect of grabbing a cup of coffee with a colleague without a demanding, sticky little human hanging off my body. I was terrified that I was giving up my career that I worked so hard to build that there would be a break in my résumé. Our country’s antiquated parental leave policy dates back to when men were the sole breadwinners who could easily support a family while women stayed home to care for the children. It ignores the fact that today two incomes are usually needed to make ends meet, that many women enjoy their careers, and that even when working full-time, women spend twice as much time as men do on child care.  Studies have repeatedly shown that paternity leave helps fathers bond with their infants and take more responsibility in child care. It also promotes gender equality and helps keep women connected to the workforce and contributing to the economy.  It’s time for the U.S. to catch up to the rest of the world, and provide paid parental leave — for both mothers and fathers. Our children deserve the best starts in life, and parents shouldn’t be forced to choose between caring for their infants and financially providing for them.\n",

            "Topic: 8 Insider Things You Never Knew About Dollar Stores, Revealed by a Manager — Dollar Store Secrets\n",
            "Paragraph: There seems to be an endless amount of curiosity surrounding dollar stores. And we get it—dollar stores are full of tremendous discounts you can't find anywhere else and helpful organization items (and yes, also some toxic products that scarred the bejeebers out of us!). But honestly, we've always wanted to know more. Like how is it possible to sell all those items so cheaply? And is that bargain-priced food actually safe to eat? Well thanks to Brandon, a somewhat-secretive Dollar General manager and his recent Reddit post—where he did an \"ask me anything\" Q&A—we now know even more about the popular chains. Here's what we found most interesting about his insider information: 1. Dollar stores don't sell items that are faulty or broken—they're discounted for a different reason. \"I assume like any retailer the product is so cheap because it's bought in massive bulk quantities (DG has around 20,000 stores to supply),\" Brandon said. \"To be honest, most of the products that aren't food are made in China, so you can probably guess why it's cheap.\" Most Popular 2. But there's one precaution he recommends when buying food: \"It's always a good habit to check expiration dates in any store,\" he said, \"but you should be A-OK if the store team rotates the food.\" 3. Yes, the stores are cheap, but the company is not. \"Normal starting pay for managers is 34-40k and is negotiable to some degree,\" Brandon explained. \"I'm in that range. I know another manager that's been with Dollar General for 15 years and gets paid 80k. Your pay depends on the size of the store you manage, location, and time with the company. You also get bonuses but I split those with my crew.\" 4. And the company seems pretty strict. In fact, you can get fired on the spot for something seemingly harmless. When asked if he ever lost his keys, he replied, \"If you lose your keys you get fired instantly, so thankfully no.\" 5. The unofficial biggest seller may (or may not) surprise you. \"The biggest steady seller for a single item would have to be cigarettes,\" he said, \"around 600 packs a week sold at my store.\" 6. And the most shoplifted items are...odd. \"The two most shoplifted items is a tie between clothes and Tide Pods,\" the manager said. \"People were just slicing open the Tide Pod Pouches and dumping them into a bag. But I've seen a lot of stupid things get stolen like two packs [of] hot cocoa mix out of a box, a few trash bags out of a box, a few Ziploc bags out of a box that were only a dollar to begin with...tons more.\" 7. Laundry products are considered the best deals, according to his customers. \"I get told laundry products. Beer is cheap too, same with phone chargers,\" he said when asked what the best dollar store deals are. \"We have iPhone 5 and 6 chargers for $15, while the stores down the street sell them for $30-40. Most of are our products are cheaper than other big box stores apparently (been told this by customers). Greeting cards are a deal. Most are 50¢-$1. If you go to a place like Hallmark they're about five bucks for the same ones.\" 8. And other dollar stores aren't the main source of competition. \"Walmart markets are the competition and ever since four of them sprang up around my city, my district hasn't been breaking last year's sales,\" he explained.\n",

            "Paragraph: Jeff Longo was wandering in the intense Florida heat when he saw a tiny ball of fluff on the sidewalk. What’s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health. This took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn’t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll. Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg. Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC. However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn’t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online. First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website’s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he’d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for. It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds. The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother’s shoes. So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him – even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream. As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family. Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of Longo’s dogs. That said, given their difference in stature, Longo admitted that he had to \"watch them so they don’t accidentally squish her.\"\n",

In Warner Bros.' 2018 take on Tomb Raider, Oscar winner Alicia Vikander embodies the title role, and she looks fierce as hell. Here's Vikander in Croft's iconic gray tank top and cargo pants, ready to fight any haters in the woods: The synopsis, according to a press release, finds Lara struggling to find herself and dealing with her father's death: Lara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone.  Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death. Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan.  But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous.  Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who—against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit—must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.  If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider. Tomb Raider hits theaters in March 2018.\n",

            "Paragraph: It sounds like a dream: Checking your bank balance to find it higher, much higher, than it should be. But it can — and does — happen. American consumers have seen bank mistakes in their favor for thousands and even hundreds of thousands of dollars. \"I felt like I was in a Monopoly moment,\" Leslie Holland told NBC about opening a statement from her brokerage account to see $23,000 that wasn't hers. \"Like getting the card that says bank error in your favor: Collect $200.\" \"You do have that moment of 'Oh my God, I won the lottery,'\" said Holland, a marketing executive in Louisville, Kentucky. She didn't call her bank immediately. \"I was walking around in windfall shock. You think about 'Can I keep it?'\" Mike Lieberman had the same thought after the sale of his Brooklyn apartment in 2014. After he signed over his proceeds to a visibly tired teller, he noticed the deposit slip showed a mistake in his favor — to the tune of $700,000. \"It's weird,\" he told NBC News. \"Like in a movie when you see something happens to a person and a million things run through their mind in a split second. I looked at it [and thought] 'Holy cr*p, this is really not right. Can I keep it, can I spend it, can I invest it and give it back before anyone notices?' This all goes through your head really fast.\" Industry insiders insist that while mistakes do happen, they are very few compared to the billions of successful transactions carried out every day. \"We conduct billions of transactions on a daily basis that are correct on both sides,\" said Doug Johnson, senior vice president for payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association. But \"there's always the potential for human error.\" And when mistakes are made, \"'Don't keep it,' is the firm advice,\" Johnson said. \"Eventually, the bank will come back to the customer. First they'll reverse the transaction but also potentially generate a police report after effective research, meaning the bank will contact the customer ... and ask the logical questions: Did they notice that it was inadvertently deposited, why didn't they alert the bank, why didn't they return the funds. It creates a whole confluence of events that are not attractive.\" One Georgia teen learned this the hard way. After spending $30,000 in his bank account that didn't belong to him, the young man earned a 10-year sentence, according to local news reports. A teller had deposited a check from a client with the same last name into the teen's account; he spent most of the funds on a BMW. Lieberman, a former neuroscientist, speculated on how a person might make such a bad decision. The same part of the brain that gives us a rush when, say, we win a hand of cards, kicks in when we confront a scenario like unexpected money, Lieberman suggested. The limbic system is like the rewards circuitry. \"There's a lot of dopamine signaling ... your heart rate goes up, your pupils dilate, you start sweating. That's when you make bad decisions. A lot of this is evolutionary response.\" The pre-frontal cortex, which controls reasoning and judgment, is one of the last parts of the brain to fully develop. \"It takes training and learning and life experience\" to not let that quick rush override your judgment, said Lieberman. \"I'm fortunate that I didn't do something stupid.\" After his split-second deliberations, Lieberman pointed out the $700,000 mistake to the teller. Holland pointed out her bank's error, too. \"At the end of the day this isn't my money and I kept visualizing a little old lady who's missing $23,000. I'm glad my mother taught me right from wrong,\" she said. To avoid such situations, keep a close eye on your accounts. \"Manage your balance yourself in addition to what your bank is doing,\" Johnson said. Online banking may have made it easy to throw out the old fashioned check registers, but he uses his to reconcile his account to the penny, \"even though I only write a check to the woman who takes care of our cats every two months.\" Software is also available to double check the bank's figures. And at the teller line, look at the deposit slip as confirmation and verify it is the amount intended. Also, Johnson said, double check remote deposits made with phones. \"It's really important in this world to protect yourself and to take responsibility even though we largely depend on financial institutions to do that for us,\" Johnson said. Still not convinced? Consider this: \"Back to my cybersecurity paranoia, some measures assist customers in protecting from unauthorized transactions on the other side,\" he said. \"You can definitely play a major role in the first line of defense.\" Because even if you're not in a hurry to report that big deposit, we would all want to know right away if money's going out that shouldn't.\n",

            "Topic: Why I Won't Buy One Extra Box Of Kleenex For My Kid's School Supplies. Signed, A Frustrated Parent\n",
            "Paragraph: So we started doing the school supply shopping this week. A daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive \"just this size\" binder. Now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it. I put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving. (Insert sarcastic eye roll here). Yes, I’m frustrated. And let’s talk about that list, shall we? I mean, who in their right mind thinks it’s a good idea to request that our kids purchase Expo markers in bulk or boxes of Kleenex that should be supplied already? ESPECIALLY when those might not get used by my kids? Who thinks it should be my job to bring Ziploc bags to school? Well, I’ll tell you who. This mom. I’m not going to buy just the one extra box of tissues because (let’s all be honest here) I can afford more than that. And *gasp* what if someone other than my precious Timmy uses them? Well, then, haven’t I done a good deed for the year for less than the cost of a coffee? We should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body. If you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how. Yes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo. You think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the \"-augh\" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project. More is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let’s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids \"clean\" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the \"trash\" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for. So, let’s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens? Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let’s see. Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it? I’m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers. Umm, let’s back up a minute. Aren’t they the ones doing us the favor? I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don’t learn as well then. I’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. Be frustrated with me for the right reasons.\n",

            "Paragraph: \"Game of Thrones\" star Kristian Nairn has come out as gay. The actor made the revelation during an interview with Winter Is Coming, a \"GOT\" fan site. The interviewer broached the subject of the gay community by telling Nairn he has an extensive \"bear\" following. \"Well, in all honesty, when you talk about 'the gay community,' you are talking about MY community, haha,\" he said. \"I AM aware of it yeah, and I think it’s really lovely. There’s not a day that I don’t get a few messages, but 99 percent or more are super sweet and nothing smutty at all!

And now, he's apparently trying to sell the home the same way -- as a pocket listing. Local agents confirmed to The Huffington Post that Cowell, Mr. X Factor, is allowing the 7,265-square-foot home to be shown to qualified buyers and is asking in the $20 million range. At the time he bought it, Cowell had just been looking for properties to rent. But when he saw this four-bedroom mid-century home in an exclusive Beverly Hills neighborhood, he made an offer. The U-shaped mansion was built in 1966 and was designed by Hal Levitt, architect to the stars. The TV show talent judge made the #10 spot on TV Guide's 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time, something that wouldn't surprise any contestants of \"America's Got Talent.\" As for where Mr. Nasty may be headed -- that's anybody's guess.

            "Paragraph: A lifelike statue of a nearly nude man will remain on the campus of a women's college in the Boston area through the spring. The statue, titled \"Sleepwalker\" by Tony Matelli, is part of an exhibit at the college's Davis Museum. According to the Boston Globe, it was placed in an area with a large amount of traffic and is hard to miss. It quickly created a stir on campus, and soon after there were calls from students for the statue to go, but the school says \"Sleepwalker\" is going to stay put for the semester. Wellesley College President H. Kim Bottomly told the campus community Thursday \"we cannot destroy the artistic integrity of this exhibition by moving the sculpture, and also, we must do everything we can to support those students who find themselves deeply affected by it.\" welcome to wellesley, home of the women who will and this statue of a naked man. please send your daughters here. pic.twitter.com/eRf1uJCxKA — Ailis (@lishhh15) February 5, 2014 \"We don't always have naked men at Wellesley, but when we do, they're creepy.\" pic.twitter.com/oot3yGbgJw — Ali Rondeau (@ali_rondeau) February 5, 2014 So this is what happens when guys come to @Wellesley.

The statue was frequently called creepy, and triggering for sexual violence survivors. Sarah Mahmood, a HuffPost campus editor-at-large, explained why she supports the statue's removal: However, as a college community, Wellesley's first priority should be the safety and well-being of its students. Wellesley is our home, and students have a right to feel comfortable here. The statue presents an obvious trigger for many students, who are forced to see it outside their window before they're going to sleep, or as they're on their way to class. Matelli responded to the controversy with his own criticism earlier this month, telling WBZ, \"I think that these people are misconstruing this work.

            "Topic: Which Rock Star Will Historians of the Future Remember?\n",
            "Paragraph: But envisioning this process with rock music is harder. Almost anything can be labeled \"rock\": Metallica, ABBA, Mannheim Steamroller, a haircut, a muffler. If you’re a successful tax lawyer who owns a hot tub, clients will refer to you as a \"rock-star C.P.A.\" when describing your business to less-hip neighbors. The defining music of the first half of the 20th century was jazz; the defining music of the second half of the 20th century was rock, but with an ideology and saturation far more pervasive. Only television surpasses its influence. This article is adapted from the book \"But What If We're Wrong?\" to be published in June by Blue Rider Press. And pretty much from the moment it came into being, people who liked rock insisted it was dying. The critic Richard Meltzer supposedly claimed that rock was already dead in 1968. And he was wrong to the same degree that he was right. Meltzer’s wrongness is obvious and does not require explanation, unless you honestly think \"Purple Rain\" is awful. But his rightness is more complicated: Rock is dead, in the sense that its \"aliveness\" is a subjective assertion based on whatever criteria the listener happens to care about. This is why the essential significance of rock remains a plausible thing to debate, as does the relative value of major figures within that system (the Doors, R.E.M., Radiohead). It still projects the illusion of a universe containing multitudes. But it won’t seem that way in 300 years. The symbolic value of rock is conflict-based: It emerged as a byproduct of the post-World War II invention of the teenager, soundtracking a 25-year period when the gap between generations was utterly real and uncommonly vast. That dissonance gave rock music a distinctive, nonmusical importance for a long time. But that period is over. Rock — or at least the anthemic, metaphoric, Hard Rock Cafe version of big rock — has become more socially accessible but less socially essential, synchronously shackled by its own formal limitations. Its cultural recession is intertwined with its cultural absorption. As a result, what we’re left with is a youth-oriented music genre that a) isn’t symbolically important; b) lacks creative potential; and c) has no specific tie to young people. It has completed its historical trajectory. Which means, eventually, it will exist primarily as an academic pursuit. It will exist as something people have to be taught to feel and understand. I imagine a college classroom in 300 years, in which a hip instructor is leading a tutorial filled with students. These students relate to rock music with no more fluency than they do the music of Mesopotamia: It’s a style they’ve learned to recognize, but just barely (and only because they’ve taken this specific class). Nobody in the room can name more than two rock songs, except the professor. He explains the sonic structure of rock, its origins, the way it served as cultural currency and how it shaped and defined three generations of a global superpower. He shows the class a photo, or perhaps a hologram, of an artist who has been intentionally selected to epitomize the entire concept. For these future students, that singular image defines what rock was. So what’s the image? Certainly, there’s one response to this hypothetical that feels immediate and sensible: the Beatles. All logic points to their dominance. They were the most popular band in the world during the period they were active and are only slightly less popular now, five decades later. The Beatles defined the concept of what a \"rock group\" was supposed to be, and all subsequent rock groups are (consciously or unconsciously) modeled upon the template they naturally embodied. Their 1964 appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" is so regularly cited as the genesis for other bands that they arguably invented the culture of the 1970s, a decade when they were no longer together. The Beatles arguably invented everything, including the very notion of a band’s breaking up. There are still things about the Beatles that can’t be explained, almost to the point of the supernatural: the way their music resonates with toddlers, for example, or the way it resonated with Charles Manson. It’s impossible to imagine another rock group where half its members faced unrelated assassination attempts. In any reasonable world, the Beatles are the answer to the question \"Who will be the Sousa of rock?\" But our world is not reasonable. And the way this question will be asked tomorrow is (probably) not the same way we would ask it today. In Western culture, virtually everything is understood through the process of storytelling, often to the detriment of reality. When we recount history, we tend to use the life experience of one person — the \"journey\" of a particular \"hero,\" in the lingo of the mythologist Joseph Campbell — as a prism for understanding everything else. That inclination works to the Beatles’ communal detriment. But it buoys two other figures: Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. The Beatles are the most meaningful group, but Elvis and Dylan are the towering individuals, so eminent that I wouldn’t necessarily need to use Elvis’s last name or Dylan’s first. Still, neither is an ideal manifestation of rock as a concept. It has been said that Presley invented rock and roll, but he actually staged a form of primordial \"prerock\" that barely resembles the post-\"Rubber Soul\" aesthetics that came to define what this music is. He also exited rock culture relatively early; he was pretty much out of the game by 1973. Conversely, Dylan’s career spans the entirety of rock. Yet he never made an album that \"rocked\" in any conventional way (the live album \"Hard Rain\" probably comes closest). Still, these people are rock people. Both are integral to the core of the enterprise and influenced everything we have come to understand about the form (including the Beatles themselves, a group that would not have existed without Elvis and would not have pursued introspection without Dylan). In 300 years, the idea of \"rock music\" being represented by a two‐pronged combination of Elvis and Dylan would be equitable and oddly accurate. But the passage of time makes this progressively more difficult. It’s always easier for a culture to retain one story instead of two, and the stories of Presley and Dylan barely intersect (they supposedly met only once, in a Las Vegas hotel room). As I write this sentence, the social stature of Elvis and Dylan feels similar, perhaps even identical. But it’s entirely possible one of them will be dropped as time plods forward. And if that happens, the consequence will be huge. If we concede that the \"hero’s journey\" is the de facto story through which we understand history, the differences between these two heroes would profoundly alter the description of what rock music supposedly was. If Elvis (minus Dylan) is the definition of rock, then rock is remembered as showbiz. Like Frank Sinatra, Elvis did not write songs; he interpreted songs that were written by other people (and like Sinatra, he did this brilliantly). But removing the centrality of songwriting from the rock equation radically alters it. Rock becomes a performative art form, where the meaning of a song matters less than the person singing it. It becomes personality music, and the dominant qualities of Presley’s persona — his sexuality, his masculinity, his larger‐than‐life charisma — become the dominant signifiers of what rock was. His physical decline and reclusive death become an allegory for the entire culture. The reminiscence of the rock genre adopts a tragic hue, punctuated by gluttony, drugs and the conscious theft of black culture by white opportunists. But if Dylan (minus Elvis) becomes the definition of rock, everything reverses. In this contingency, lyrical authenticity becomes everything; rock is somehow calcified as an intellectual craft, interlocked with the folk tradition. It would be remembered as far more political than it actually was, and significantly more political than Dylan himself. The fact that Dylan does not have a conventionally \"good\" singing voice becomes retrospective proof that rock audiences prioritized substance over style, and the portrait of his seven‐decade voyage would align with the most romantic version of how an eclectic collection of autonomous states eventually became a place called \"America.\" These are the two best versions of this potential process. And both are flawed. There is, of course, another way to consider how these things might unspool, and it might be closer to the way histories are actually built. I’m creating a binary reality where Elvis and Dylan start the race to posterity as equals, only to have one runner fall and disappear. The one who remains \"wins\" by default (and maybe that happens). But it might work in reverse. A more plausible situation is that future people will haphazardly decide how they want to remember rock, and whatever they decide will dictate who is declared its architect. If the constructed memory is a caricature of big‐hair arena rock, the answer is probably Elvis; if it’s a buoyant, unrealistic apparition of punk hagiography, the answer is probably Dylan. But both conclusions direct us back to the same recalcitrant question: What makes us remember the things we remember? In 2014, the jazz historian Ted Gioia published a short essay about music criticism that outraged a class of perpetually outraged music critics. Gioia’s assertion was that 21st‐century music writing has devolved into a form of lifestyle journalism that willfully ignores the technical details of the music itself. Many critics took this attack personally and accused Gioia of devaluing their vocation. Which is odd, considering the colossal degree of power Gioia ascribes to record reviewers: He believes specialists are the people who galvanize history. Critics have almost no impact on what music is popular at any given time, but they’re extraordinarily well positioned to dictate what music is reintroduced after its popularity has waned. \"Over time, critics and historians will play a larger role in deciding whose fame endures,\" Gioia wrote me in an email. \"Commercial factors will have less impact. I don’t see why rock and pop will follow any different trajectory from jazz and blues.\" He rattled off several illustrative examples: Ben Selvin outsold Louis Armstrong in the 1920s. In 1956, Nelson Riddle and Les Baxter outsold \"almost every rock ’n’ roll star not named Elvis,\" but they’ve been virtually erased from the public record. A year after that, the closeted gay crooner Tab Hunter was bigger than Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino, \"but critics and music historians hate sentimental love songs. They’ve constructed a perspective that emphasizes the rise of rock and pushes everything else into the background. Transgressive rockers, in contrast, enjoy lasting fame.\" He points to a contemporary version of that phenomenon: \"Right now, electronic dance music probably outsells hip‐hop. This is identical to the punk‐versus‐disco trade‐off of the 1970s. My prediction: edgy hip‐hop music will win the fame game in the long run, while E.D.M. will be seen as another mindless dance craze.\" Gioia is touching on a variety of volatile ideas here, particularly the outsize memory of transgressive art. His example is the adversarial divide between punk and disco: In 1977, the disco soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the Sex Pistols’ \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols\" were both released. The soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" has sold more than 15 million copies; it took \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" 15 years to go platinum. Yet virtually all pop historiographers elevate the importance of the Pistols above that of the Bee Gees. The same year the Sex Pistols finally sold the millionth copy of their debut, SPIN magazine placed them on a list of the seven greatest bands of all time. \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" is part of the White House record library, supposedly inserted by Amy Carter just before her dad lost to Ronald Reagan. The album’s reputation improves by simply existing: In 1985, the British publication NME classified it as the 13th‐greatest album of all time; in 1993, NME made a new list and decided it now deserved to be ranked third. This has as much to do with its transgressive identity as its musical integrity. The album is overtly transgressive (and therefore memorable), while \"Saturday Night Fever\" has been framed as a prefab totem of a facile culture (and thus forgettable). For more than three decades, that has been the overwhelming consensus. But I’ve noticed — just in the last four or five years — that this consensus is shifting. Why? Because the definition of \"transgressive\" is shifting. It’s no longer appropriate to dismiss disco as superficial. More and more, we recognize how disco latently pushed gay, urban culture into white suburbia, which is a more meaningful transgression than going on a British TV talk show and swearing at the host. So is it possible that the punk‐disco polarity will eventually flip? Yes. It’s possible everyone could decide to reverse how we remember 1977. But there’s still another stage here, beyond that hypothetical inversion: the stage in which everybody who was around for punk and disco is dead and buried, and no one is left to contradict how that moment felt. When that happens, the debate over transgressions freezes and all that is left is the music. Which means the Sex Pistols could win again or maybe they lose bigger, depending on the judge. \"There is a justice-driven part of my brain that believes — or needs to believe — that the cream rises to the top, and the best work endures by virtue of its goodness,\" argues the music writer Amanda Petrusich, author of \"Do Not Sell at Any Price,\" a dive into the obsessive world of 78 r.p.m. record collectors. \"That music becomes emblematic because it’s the most effective. When I think of rock and who might survive, I immediately think of the Rolling Stones. They’re a band that sounds like what we’ve all decided rock ’n’ roll should sound like: loose and wild. Their story reflects that ethos and sound: loose and wild. And also, they’re good.\" This is true. The Rolling Stones are good, even when they release records like \"Bridges to Babylon.\" They’ve outlived every band that ever competed against them, with career album sales exceeding the present population of Brazil. From a credibility standpoint, the Rolling Stones are beyond reproach, regardless of how they choose to promote themselves: They’ve performed at the Super Bowl, in a Kellogg’s commercial and on an episode of \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" The name of the biggest magazine covering rock music was partly inspired by their sheer existence. The group members have faced arrest on multiple continents, headlined the most disastrous concert in California history and classified themselves (with surprisingly little argument) as \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world\" since 1969. Working from the premise that the collective memory of rock should dovetail with the artist who most accurately represents what rock music actually was, the Rolling Stones are a strong answer. But not the final answer. NASA sent the unmanned craft Voyager I into deep space in 1977. It’s still out there, forever fleeing Earth’s pull. No man‐made object has ever traveled farther; it crossed the orbit of Pluto in 1989 and currently tumbles through the interstellar wasteland. The hope was that this vessel would eventually be discovered by intelligent extraterrestrials, so NASA included a compilation album made of gold, along with a rudimentary sketch of how to play it with a stylus. A team led by Carl Sagan curated the album’s contents. The record, if played by the aliens, is supposed to reflect the diversity and brilliance of earthling life. This, obviously, presupposes a lot of insane hopes: that the craft will somehow be found, that the craft will somehow be intact, that the aliens who find it will be vaguely human, that these vaguely human aliens will absorb stimuli both visually and sonically and that these aliens will not still be listening to eight‐tracks. But it did guarantee that one rock song will exist even if the earth is spontaneously swallowed by the sun: \"Johnny B. Goode,\" by Chuck Berry. The song was championed by Ann Druyan (who later become Sagan’s wife) and Timothy Ferris, a science writer and friend of Sagan’s who contributed to Rolling Stone magazine. According to Ferris, who was the album’s de facto producer, the folklorist Alan Lomax was against the selection of Berry, based on the argument that rock music was too childish to represent the highest achievements of the planet. (I’m assuming Lomax wasn’t too heavily engaged with the debate over the Sex Pistols and \"Saturday Night Fever\" either.) \"Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock song on the Voyager disc, although a few other tunes were considered. \"Here Comes the Sun\" was a candidate, and all four Beatles wanted it to be included, but none of them owned the song’s copyright, so it was killed for legal reasons. The fact that this happened in 1977 was also relevant to the song’s selection. \"Johnny B. Goode\" was 19 years old that year, which made it seem distinguished, almost prehistoric, at the time. I suspect the main reason \"Johnny B. Goode\" was chosen is that it just seemed like a reasonable track to select. But it was more than reasonable. It was, either deliberately or accidentally, the best possible artist for NASA to select. Chuck Berry may very well become the artist society selects when rock music is retroactively reconsidered by the grandchildren of your grandchildren. Let’s assume all the individual components of rock shatter and dissolve, leaving behind a hazy residue that categorizes rock ’n’ roll as a collection of memorable tropes. If this transpires, historians will reconstitute the genre like a puzzle. They will look at those tropes as a suit and try to decide who fits that suit best. And that theoretical suit was tailored for Chuck Berry’s body. Rock music is simple, direct, rhythm‐based music. Berry made simple, direct, rhythm‐based music. Rock music is black music mainstreamed by white musicians, particularly white musicians from England. Berry is a black man who directly influenced Keith Richards and Jimmy Page. Rock music is preoccupied with sex. Berry was a sex addict whose only American No. 1 single was about playing with his penis. Rock music is lawless. Berry went to prison twice before he turned 40. Rock music is tied to myth and legend (so much so that the decline of rock’s prominence coincides with the rise of the Internet and the destruction of anecdotal storytelling). Berry is the subject of multiple urban legends, several of which might actually be true and which often seem to involve cheapness, violence and sexual defecation. \"If you tried to give rock and roll another name,\" John Lennon famously said, \"you might call it Chuck Berry.\" That quote is as close as we come to a full‐on Sousa scenario, where the person and the thing are ideologically interchangeable. Chuck Berry’s persona is the purest distillation of what we understand rock music to be. The songs he made are essential, but secondary to who he was and why he made them. He is the idea itself.\n",

But according to this new survey, if they could pick their ideal way to meet people, college students would swipe left on Tinder and choose the old-fashioned way of finding love. Apartment-hunting app Adobo surveyed 3,500 college students to figure out where they were looking for love (and finding it). Of those surveyed, only 4 percent said dating apps were their preferred method for meeting new people. More than 80 percent still preferred meeting people through mutual friends or shared interests, like music or sports. Tinder reigned supreme as the post popular dating app. According to Adobo’s survey, 17 percent of participants use Bumble, while OKCupid users only made up 9 percent of participants.

            "Paragraph: (Reuters Health) - High school girls who use the most effective methods of birth control are less likely to also use condoms, making them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), researchers say. Girls who use intrauterine devices and implants to prevent pregnancies are less likely to use condoms than their peers taking birth control pills, they found. \"The findings highlight a need for strategies to increase condom use among all users of highly and moderately effective contraceptive methods ... to prevent STIs,\" wrote lead researcher Riley Steiner of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, in an email to Reuters Health. Intrauterine and implantable devices are highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, the researchers write in JAMA Pediatrics. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says these devices, which are known as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), should be first-line birth control options for teenagers. Among 100 women on LARC, there will be about one unintended pregnancy per year, according to ACOG. That's compared to six to nine unintended pregnancies among 100 women using the Depo-Provera shot, birth control pills, rings or patches. For the new study, the researchers used data from a 2013 survey of U.S. high school students in grades nine through 12. Of the 2,288 sexually active girls in the survey, about 2 percent used LARC, about 22 percent used birth control pills, about 41 percent used condoms, about 12 percent used withdrawal or other methods, about 16 percent used no contraceptive method and about 6 percent used the shot, patch or ring. About 2 percent didn't know which method they used. Overall, LARC users were about 60 percent less likely to use condoms, compared to girls taking birth control pills. There was no significant difference in condom use between those using the shot, patch or ring and those using LARC. Steiner said it's unclear why girls on LARC are less likely to use condoms but offered two possible explanations. \"Young women using highly effective LARC methods may be less likely to use condoms because they don’t perceive a need for additional protection from pregnancy; It’s also possible that providers are more likely to offer LARC to adolescents who rarely or never use condoms,\" she said. LARC users were also more likely to have two or more sexual partners in the past three months and four or more lifetime sexual partners, compared to those using the shot, patch, ring and pills. \"The important takeaway message from this story is that we need to be giving girls the right message of why condom use is important,\" said Dr. Julia Potter, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. Steiner said the new results should not deter adolescent LARC use, \"but rather inform how STI prevention is addressed within the context of adolescent LARC scale-up.\" Potter, of Boston Medical Center, also said more research on why girls using LARC aren't using condoms as much is needed so that people aren't basing their opinions on assumptions.\n",

            "Topic: One little drop of your blood may someday predict how long you’ll live\n",
            "Paragraph: Blood has many roles in the metaphorical life of the human body. It’s the organ of kinship (\"blood ties\"), the seat of emotion (\"blood lust\") and a vehicle for identity (\"travel is in his blood\"). But might it also be a window on the body’s fate? Many scientists are trying to answer that question as a practical matter, not a metaphor. They are scouring the blood for biomarkers — easily measured substances that illuminate what’s going on in hard-to-reach places. Biomarkers aren’t new to medicine. Many lab tests are, in fact, tests of biomarkers. Sugar or protein in a sample of urine can shed light on what’s happening in the kidneys or pancreas. The concentration of cholesterol in the blood may hint at disease in the arteries. What’s changed is medicine’s ability to measure more molecules, with greater precision and less cost, than was possible in the past. The result is a storehouse of information on millions of people, most of it available at the prick of a hypodermic needle. When the health and longevity of those people are correlated with the readings of their biomarkers, it becomes possible to find biomarker profiles that predict risk of future disease or early death. A recent attempt to do just that was described this year in the journal Aging Cell by Paola Sebastiani, a biostatistician at the Boston University School of Public Health. Her subjects were members of the Long Life Family Study — 5,000 people in 550 families with a predilection for longevity. The volunteers in the study were subjected to many blood tests. Sebastiani and her colleagues focused on 19 that proved to be most informative. The tests included common ones (hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin) and exotic ones (C-reactive protein, insulinlike growth factor). Together, the tests shed light on six domains of physiology, including inflammation, kidney function and blood-sugar metabolism. A computer algorithm analyzed the test results in the thousands of volunteers and determined that they fell into 26 patterns, or clusters. Each cluster contained people with similar test results. The biggest one had 2,200 people, all of whom had test readings close to the average for the whole study population. They became the reference group. \"The methodology that I used is to look at multiple markers simultaneously, which is challenging. You have to have a lot of data to be able to do this,\" Sebastiani said. The researchers found the clusters differed from each other, and from the reference group, in their rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and premature death, and also in measures of aging, such as grip strength and walking speed. As expected, one cluster was considerably healthier than the average, with a low incidence of disease and early death. Its members seemed to have biological ages younger than their chronological ages. In short, the 19 blood tests together formed a biomarker that told people whether they were aging prematurely, and predicted in general terms the chances of developing serious illness or dying early. Sebastiani and her team then looked to see whether the biomarkers worked in a different population. They chose the Offspring Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study — several thousand men and women who had had blood tests done periodically since the 1970s. The biomarkers held up. They divided that population into clusters with the same patterns of disease risk, premature aging and early death as seen in the Long Life Family Study. The research didn’t address whether people could move from one biomarker cluster to another, and in so doing change their risk for a bad outcome. But Sebastiani suspects they can — and do. \"There are a lot of things you can do to improve biomarkers. They are not all hard-wired, like genetic mutations,\" she said. Such biomarker profiling would be useful in clinical trials of anti-aging treatments because it would allow researchers to measure the efficacy of a drug by seeing whether a person taking it shifted from a cluster with advanced biological age and elevated risk for disease, to a more youthful, lower-risk one. The more obvious use, however, is in the routine doctor visit, where it could provide patients a peek at what may lie ahead and a chance, Ebenezer Scroogelike, to alter their fates. There is, of course, much more in blood than what the Boston University researchers were looking at. For example, there are white blood cells containing thousands of genes in various states of activity. It turns out they, too, can be biomarkers. In a study published in 2009, Richard A. Kerber at the University of Louisville and two collaborators looked at 2,100 genes that are always turned on in cells, most of them doing molecular housekeeping. The researchers measured the amount of activity of each gene in blood samples drawn from about 100 people in the 1980s and then frozen. The people were 57 to 97 years old at the time. Even though all the genes were active, for many of them the amount of activity varied by a person’s age. In all, 10 percent tended to become more active as a person got older, and 6 percent became less active. Using that information, the researchers were able to say what biological age based on gene activity looked like for each year of middle and old age. Many of the people had since died — a fact that allowed the researchers to calculate what the risk of death had been over the decades for people with various biological ages at the time the blood was drawn. It turned out that for every \"extra\" year of biological age, a person’s risk of dying was about one-third higher than it would normally have been. For example, a 55-year-old with the gene-activity profile of a 56-year-old had a 33 percent greater risk of dying at age 55 than a 55-year-old person whose biological age matched his chronological age. As with the blood biomarkers, this one will probably be more useful as a signpost than as a crystal ball. \"I don’t think it’s ever going to be very accurate in terms of predicting how long someone is going to live,\" Kerber said. \"There are too many random factors; too much stuff can happen. But if it’s monitored at several time points, it could tell you whether you’re going in the right direction or not.\" Other ways of measuring gene activity are also proving to be useful gauges of disease risk and longevity, at least in research studies. Just last month, a team of scientists led by Yan Zhang at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg reported that a phenomenon called DNA methylation may be one. In methylation, a methyl group (a cluster of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms) attaches to the DNA strand, repressing the gene at that spot. Patterns of methylation are strongly influenced by age, sex, and environmental and lifestyle exposures, including smoking and exercise. Methylation also plays a role in the onset and course of many chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders. The German team found that specific methylation patterns at just 10 sites (out of thousands), when measured in people in their 60s, strongly predicted a person’s risk of dying over the next 10 years. So, blood biomarkers that predict longevity — hemo-augury, you might call it — are a hot topic in medical research. But can they tell us anything useful that we don’t already know? Various studies have shown that genes are responsible for only 30 percent of our longevity. The other 70 percent is determined by diet, exercise, weight, habits such as smoking and drinking, family and social life, along with access to medical care, and luck. How much difference ­nongenetic factors can make is evident in the experience of ­Seventh-Day Adventists. The members of that Christian sect don’t smoke or drink, tend to be vegetarians and have strong family and church-community bonds. Life expectancy is 86 for Adventist men and 89 for of Adventist women, compared with 76 for American men overall and 81 for American women. Adventists come from many ethnic and racial backgrounds, so the big increase in longevity is presumably the consequence of behavior, not genes. \"What that says is that we humans have, on average, a genetic blueprint that allows us to get to a very old age,\" said Thomas T. Perls, a geriatrician at Boston University who directs a study of very old people called the New England Centenarian Study. \"If we take advantage of that blueprint, we get to almost 90. If we fight it, then we’re going to die in our 50s or 60s.\" Biomarkers that hint at our chances for a long life are scientifically interesting. Perls’s research, for example, has found that people who live to age 105 share many rare variants of just 130 genes out of the 20,000 they all carry. But as a practical matter, we don’t need to wait for ­hemo-augury to show up at our doctor’s office. We already know what to do to make ourselves healthier. Brown is a physician and journalist.\n",

            "Paragraph: This article first appeared on Pretty52 Before being cast as Harry Potter at the tender age of 11, Daniel Radcliffe had never really starred in a big-budget feature film before and so no doubt it must have been a pretty nerve-wracking experience, especially since the rest of the cast was filled with such British acting icons as Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Robbie Coltrane. If we were Daniel, we'd have found it pretty daunting to work with some of those big names too. And over the years Daniel just worked with more and more of them, starring alongside Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Helena Bonham-Carter, and David Thewlis. But speaking to People magazine, Daniel revealed there was one actor who struck fear into him like no other, and to be fair, we're not really surprised: \" I remember when I was 15 doing scenes with Ralph for the first time. He was even scarier than Alan (Rickman) was at first. Alan was super-intimidating to start off with as well, but then you get into it, but Ralph genuinely scared me for a few years. To be fair, being afraid of the actors behind both Snape and Voldemort is probably fair. It's a real testament to the skill of Ralph and Alan that they were able to strike such fear into the heart of Daniel while they were in character, though to be fair, it must be pretty scary to work with such legends even when they're not playing the characters who haunted all our nightmares when we were kids. Was there anyone in the Harry Potter films that you'd have been absolutely petrified of if you'd had to work with them? Let us know in the comments!\n",

            "Paragraph: The Doomsday Clock, a metaphor for global catastrophe, remains set at three minutes to midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board, in conjunction with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates, announced their annual decision on the clock's setting Tuesday afternoon, and said it would stay the same as last year. They said they based their decision on the global threat of climate change, as well as continued nuclear tensions between the U.S. and Russia and between Pakistan and India, and the recent claim by North Korea of testing a hydrogen bomb. Lawrence Krauss, chair of the Board of Sponsors and a renowned physicist and professor at Arizona State University, said that the decision to not move the clock is a sign of the troubles facing humanity. \"It is of grave concern that the situation remains largely the same,\" he told reporters. Despite the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 nations that agreed to reduce carbon emissions, Krauss said that \"the fight against climate change has barely begun.\" In order to improve the situation so the clock can be moved back, the Bulletin calls on the citizens of the world to implore leaders to reduce nuclear modernization programs, engage North Korea to reduce nuclear risks, follow up on the Paris accord deal and deal with commercial nuclear waste problems now. Each year, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists analyzes global threats including nuclear weapons, climate-changing technologies, emerging biotechnologies and cybertechnology to determine how close the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock should be to midnight. Midnight, in this case, represents the apocalypse. Last year the Board agreed to move the clock to 11:57 -- two minutes closer to midnight than it was before -- because of a failure to halt climate change and an increasing nuclear arms arsenal. Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, told reporters that world leaders' failure to act on these issues endangers every person in the world. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The metaphoric Doomsday Clock was created two years later. The clock has moved 22 times in 69 years. The closest it has come to midnight was in 1953, when it was set at two minutes to midnight after the United States and Russia tested hydrogen bombs.\n",

            "Topic: California Moves One Step Closer To Ending Medical Marijuana 'Chaos'\n",
            "Paragraph: A bill that would provide order to California's muddled medical marijuana program cleared a major hurdle Friday, when the state Assembly's Appropriations Committee moved it forward for a full Assembly vote next week. Authored by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco), the measure, AB 1894, would create uniform rules to govern the state's multibillion-dollar medical marijuana industry. Although California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal use in 1996, the state has yet to establish a set of standards guiding the cultivation, production and sale of the plant, which has led to what Ammiano described to The Huffington Post as \"chaos.\" \"I am optimistic that we can continue to work with all parties to finally create regulation that will satisfy all needs,\" Ammiano said in a statement Friday, \"from federal law enforcement down to the very sick patients who depend on the health benefits only marijuana can provide.\" California currently leaves it up to local governments to decide how they want to implement the state's medical marijuana law. As a result, some cities, like San Francisco and Oakland, have established clear-cut systems that dictate where dispensaries can operate and impose fees that directly enrich their coffers. Other places, like San Diego and San Jose, remain largely unregulated, with very little control over where pot-related businesses can operate. San Jose lawmakers are currently mulling legislation that would effectively make it impossible for medical marijuana providers to exist. \"Marijuana has never been regulated by the state as any other business,\" Ammiano told HuffPost last year after introducing similar legislation. \"Cities and counties don't know what to do or what they can do. Police are unsure how to respond.\" AB 1894 would create a division within California's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to regulate all medical marijuana-related entities throughout the state, from the farmers that cultivate the plant to the storefronts that sell it. The proposal would allow the agency to impose fees on marijuana businesses in order to raise revenue for the state, and local municipalities would also be allowed to impose additional taxes. \"Without regulation, there's no way to capture any of the income that could go toward our infrastructure or other worthy causes,\" Ammiano told HuffPost last month. California's lack of statewide regulations over its pot program has left it vulnerable to federal interference, as the drug is still classified as a Schedule 1 substance (along with heroin and LSD) in the eyes of the national government. In 2011, a coalition of U.S. attorneys launched an aggressive crackdown on medical marijuana operations throughout the state under the guise that the industry had spiraled out of control. Since then, hundreds of businesses related to the drug have closed, and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Last month, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided several dispensaries in Los Angeles, and a pot shop in Mendocino, closed by federal authorities earlier this year, only recently reopened. By contrast, the Obama administration has been less combative in states with more comprehensive regulations. Colorado, for example, has faced fewer DEA raids and has been allowed to implement its groundbreaking recreational, adult-use law largely in peace. Late last year, Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the federal government would not intervene in states that had \"strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems.\" \"While statewide regulations won't change federal law, it does seem to be the case that states that have uniform, clear regulations are less likely to be interfered with by the feds,\" Tom Angell, the head of weed advocacy group Marijuana Majority, told HuffPost last mont. \"It's very confusing in California right now: a patchwork of regulations city to city and county to county.\" Ammiano has made many attempts to create statewide medical marijuana regulations over the past few years, but each piece of legislation stalled or was defeated by opponents who argued the measures didn't address key issues like the environmental implications of growing cannabis or the criteria for doctors to make recommendations to patients. He's confident his current bill addresses every concern and more. \"I'm cautiously optimistic,\" he told HuffPost last month. \"People have seen that the more regulation you have, the less chaos you have.\" Meanwhile, marijuana reform advocates believe a measure like Ammiano's is the key to paving the way for a law that would allow recreational use by adults in the state. Recent polls have suggested a majority of Californians support legalizing pot for recreational purposes, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has joined an effort to place a legalization initiative on the 2016 ballot. But first, \"we need to show that California has the ability to regulate marijuana,\" Angell said. \"This would help further demonstrate how tax revenue can be generated and put into needed programs.\"\n",

            "Topic: Is There Really A 2 Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor In Africa?\n",
            "Paragraph: An ancient nuclear reactor that was churning away 2 billion years ago sounds like a myth. Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions. The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago! It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions. One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium. That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident. Unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened. The conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows. The first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started. The second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction. The nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. The neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. Then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. This watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years. Sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: The levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. The reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed – including the enigma of the \"missing uranium.\" Featured Image: Danilo Russo/Flickr Source: Naturally Occurring Nuclear Fission\n",

            "Topic: After All This Time, We May Finally Know Who Let The Dogs Out\n",
            "Paragraph: HuffPost Hit Backspace, a new series from The Huffington Post, for a regular dose of pop culture nostalgia. They demand an answer, but offer none. \"Who let the dogs out? Who, who, who, who?\" ask the Baha Men, four times in succession. The group’s only major U.S. hit, \"Who Let The Dogs Out,\" dropped into the new millennium on July 25, 2000, as a cover of a calypso track already popular in the Caribbean. While it would only climb to No. 40 on the Billboard charts, the song became inescapable ― especially if you were a kid, or were raising one, at the time. Or if you often found yourself in sports stadiums. The track initially sold three million albums, yet its enigmatic refrain remained unresolved. Who let the dogs out? To know that, we first need to answer: Who are the dogs? According to Anslem Douglas, the Trinidad and Tobago native who wrote the original song in 1996, titled \"Doggie\" ― which was covered hideously by a British group before the Baha Men ― the dogs are badly behaved dudes. \"It’s a man-bashing song, it is,\" Douglas told The Huffington Post, explaining how his former brother-in-law often used the phrase. \"He used to come in and say, ‘Who let the dogs out?!’ And one time he asked me, ‘Why don’t you turn this into a song?’\" he explained. \"And the rest is history.\" Although we suspected the words between the song’s riotous refrains may actually refer to women ― \"dog\" can be a derogatory term for either gender ― the lyrics back him up. After their first round of asking who, who, let the dogs out, the Baha Men sing: When the party was nice, the party was bumpin’ (Hey, Yippie, Yi, Yo) And everybody havin’ a ball (Hah, Ho, Yippie, Yi, Yo) I tell the fellas, \"Start the name callin’\" (Yippie, Yi, Yo) And the girls respond to the call ― the poor dog show up! The scene: a party. Douglas, however, explained that the party is merely a metaphor ― another way to say things were going swell, generally, in life. The speaker then calls on his male friends to engage in rude name-calling toward the women partygoers, who respond in turn. According to Douglas, it’s the women who then start calling the men \"dogs\" in each refrain. (He also told us the song is chiefly a lighthearted one, and that the lyrics weren’t necessarily meant for extended analysis.) In other lines, the speaker orders the \"ruffy,\" \"scruffy, \"flea-infested mongrel\" dogs to \"get back,\" but at one point changes his tune to defend his terrible friends from \"any girls calling them canine.\" He vows to be calm in the face of such verbal abuse, prying the \"dummy\" women to just be chill, gawd. The next stanza, though, seemingly rejects male gender norms to suggest that \"a doggy is nuttin’\" if he doesn’t have \"a bone\" ― or a romantic partner. The last bit has the speaker seemingly worrying about a particular love interest in the sea of terrible prospects, ultimately puffing up his chest to call himself \"the man of the land\" and positioning himself as a sort of alpha. While the song bashes male \"dogs,\" the speaker admits he’s one of their pack. So, who let them all out? We asked Douglas point blank, along with Baha Men lead singer Isaiah Taylor and S-Curve founder Steven Greenberg, who recorded the track. \"I can’t answer that! If I answer that, people will stop asking,\" Douglas said, laughing. \"100 years from now, I will still not [have] answer[ed] that.\" Greenberg responded similarly. \"I think that’s a question best left unanswered,\" the producer said. \"Why ruin it? Why get people to stop guessing?\" Taylor, though, had a different answer. \"I always say that that our drummer did that,\" he said, explaining how it became an inside joke among the Baha Men to accuse their bandmate. \"We say, ‘Hey, man, you let the dogs out!’\" No one asked us, but if they had, we might have suggested it had something to do with the persistent patriarchal systems that created a culture where men can behave badly with minimal consequence to their reputations or relationships.\n",

            "Paragraph: It may have been Ellen Pompeo's first time in the \"Watch What Happens: Live\" clubhouse, but the \"Grey's Anatomy\" star was every bit as candid as the best of Andy Cohen's guests. It seemed that there were no questions he could pose that she wasn't willing to answer honestly. When asked who was a better kisser out of Patrick Dempsey and Chris O'Donnell, she quickly answered Dempsey. As for why? \"We don’t have that much time,\" Pompeo said. Of T.R. Knight, Katherine Heigl and Isaiah Washington, Pompeo said she missed Heigl and Knight the most -- it was a tie. \"T.R. and Katie are kind of the same person,\" she said. \"They’re a sandwich.\" When asked who was the \"bigger bitch\" to work with out of Heigl and Washington, Pompeo said, \"Isaiah all the way!\" Washington was famously let go from the show after using homophobic slurs against castmate Knight. And Heigl left very publicly after she insulted the show's quality. That drama recently came back to haunt the actress in a Hollywood Reporter piece about how difficult she is to work with. A caller wanted to know if Pompeo thought Heigl would ever return to \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and Pompeo basically said, \"No.\" She said that Heigl has a deal for a new CIA-themed series with NBC. The show is currently in development and Pompeo sent \"much love\" to her former co-star, saying that she can't wait to see it. As for her show, Pompeo ranked the \"Grey's Anatomy\" musical episode below the one where Izzie had sex with Denny's ghost, though many fans believe they were equally awful, with still others having a soft spot for the weirdness that was that musical episode. Pompeo also addressed some controversy over comments she made about the Emmys. She was quoted as calling the show \"disappointing,\" noting that it \"lacked diversity.\" But she told Cohen that her comments were made \"off the record\" -- as in while she was walking from the elevator into an interview. Her team is looking into what happened, but she stands by her quotes nonetheless.

But before you even think at the money, time, and energy it will take to make your garden grow again, consider this instead. As most gardeners know, growing a tomato plant is usually a real pain. But as it turns, that ruby red vegetable is now easier to grow than ever before. And when you see how to add one to your yard without breaking a sweat, you’ll have more tomatoes than you’ll know what to do with!

            "Topic: Could Marvel Finally Be Adding the X-Men to the MCU?\n",
            "Paragraph: Marvel’s been an unstoppable force in the realm of superhero cinema, beginning in 2008 with Iron Man, and growing into the beastly expanded universe we have today. At every turn, it’s managed to bury its DC competitors (Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy excepted), and it’s made them the undisputed champions both critically and at the box office. But even through all this, the studio has always had an Achilles heel, centered around the fact that Marvel doesn’t actually own the movie rights to many of its own characters. Sony’s run of Spider-Man films pre-dates even the earliest days of the MCU. 20th Century Fox has been butchering the Fantastic Four since 2005, while its popular X-Men franchise goes all the way back to 2000. Recently though, Sony came to terms with Marvel Studios over the web-slinger, agreeing to share Spider-Man for the good of both operations. It paid off in spades in Captain America: Civil War, and soon Sony will get a fully Marvel-backed standalone film that’s almost guaranteed to make them huge piles of money. Given the relative success of Sony’s deal with Marvel, you can bet that the folks over at 20th Century Fox are intently watching. Matt Key, the producer on Kevin Smith’s \"Fatman on Batman\" podcast recently cited rumors that seem to confirm this too:    I’ve heard from a few of my sources, my little birds that Fox and Marvel have ... kind of talked, but not really, but like there’s interest from Fox, like, \"Oh, you know, what they did with Sony and Spider-Man is actually pretty cool, like, maybe ... \" We’re years away from that ever possibly happening ... but I think that’s what it would take ... Fox joining hands with Marvel. This is far from a guarantee of anything, but what it does show us is that Fox is standing up and taking notice of the success of Sony and Marvel’s Spider-Man team-up, a deal that benefits both sides. For Sony, it gets the backing of the MCU and the money that comes along with it. Marvel in turn gets to bring one of its most iconic heroes back into the fold, while assuming creative control over Sony’s standalone Spider-Man movies. Money-wise, Sony still gets to keep every dollar from its own Spidey films, and Marvel gets the same for any other MCU film that prominently features the web-slinger. Fox making a similar deal would make a whole lot of sense. X-Men: Apocalypse failed to impress at the box office, and netted the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score for the franchise since the unmitigated disaster that was X-Men Origins. And that’s not even going into the fact that the Fantastic Four have never quite clicked for Fox. Deadpool is the only superhero that’s managed to hit the mark for Fox in the meantime. So while we may be \"years away from that ever possibly happening,\" there’s no doubting that it would be a veritable shot in the arm for all of Fox’s superhero properties. A Fox/Marvel deal wouldn’t be entirely unprecedented either. The two studios recently came to terms over two separate spinoff TV series set in the X-Men universe, Hellfire and Legion. Whether that could lead to a much larger discussion about sharing the X-Men movie-verse is anyone’s guess, yet it still shows a willingness on both sides to come to the table and negotiate. When it comes down to brass tax, the best thing for 20th Century Fox would be sharing both X-Men and Fantastic Four. Hell, it even has a silver bullet in Deadpool that makes it so the studio would be coming from a solid bargaining position. Imagine an Infinity War movie that manages to incorporate Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen into the greater narrative? Or an X-Men movie set in a universe where both the Avengers and Inhumans exist? An agreement between the two studios opens up nigh infinite possibilities from a story perspective. When it comes to large-scale agreements like this would be, \"we’d get a really cool story\" isn’t what matters most to the people in charge. No, money is what talks, and an MCU with the X-Men would make a whole lot of it. Here we circle back to Sony’s Spider-Man deal. Tom Holland as Peter Parker was one of the many highlights of Civil War, but the real test will come when Spider-Man: Homecoming hits theaters next summer. When it inevitably makes a killing at the box office, there’s little doubt Fox will be watching closely. With two Marvel properties still in hand, 20th Century Fox has a whole lot to bring to the table for the MCU. A deal similar to Sony’s would only require folding its universe into Marvel’s, and frequently borrowing characters, all while Fox still gets to reap the rewards of standalone X-Men films. Basically, it’s a no-lose for all involved. It’s just up to the higher-ups at both studios to get it done, both for our benefit and, even more significantly, theirs.\n",

            "Paragraph: Last month, I left my three children for almost two full weeks to travel across Nicaragua with my stepmother and sister. The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\" If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them. Why would anyone find this shocking? OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless — from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track. Most Popular Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map. So why the question? Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\" Why are we accepting this as normal? My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well. This is why I needed a vacation. Alone. \"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip. I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were. My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it. Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that's exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. Fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them. So go on. Leave the kids with Daddy. It's good for everyone. And I promise when you do, I will never ask you who is taking care of them. Because I will already know.\n",

            "Paragraph: If you have Amazon Prime, you officially no longer need your roommate's mom's neighbor's HBO Go password to finish your \"Sopranos\" binge-fest. \"The Sopranos,\" \"Six Feet Under,\" \"Deadwood\" and many other HBO classics will be made available to subscribers of Amazon Prime on May 21, the two companies announced Wednesday. HBO signed a deal with Amazon to make its archive of television programs available for streaming for Prime customers. This is the first time HBO content has been available on an online-only streaming service. The main catch is that only shows that have been out for three or more years will show up on Amazon Prime. Older shows like \"The Wire\" and \"Big Love\" will be available in their entirety, while the newest seasons of \"Girls\" and \"Veep\" won't be available for three more years. The only way to stream seasons broadcast in the past three years is through HBO Go, which is only available to HBO subscribers saddled with an expensive cable package. One twist: Certain tentpole franchises in the HBO universe, including \"Game Of Thrones,\" \"Sex and the City,\" \"Entourage,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" are not part of the Amazon deal, Re/code reports. These series are apparently just too popular for HBO to give up. Right now, an Amazon Prime subscription costs $99 per year. In addition to streaming video, it also includes free two-day shipping on many goods sold by the online retail giant and access to Kindle's lending library. That price went up from $79 last March. Don't have Prime or HBO Go and still want to watch classic HBO shows? A few, like \"The Sopranos,\" are available through Netflix's DVD rental service and are generally available for purchase on DVD. HBO Go is also coming to Amazon's new $99 streaming media player, Amazon Fire, by the end of the year. This deal could be a blow to Netflix, which has been in competition with Amazon's streaming service since its inception. Last August, Netflix snatched up an exclusive streaming deal with The Weinstein Co. for its movies, including \"The Artist\" and \"The King's Speech.\" Both Amazon and Netflix have also released their own original shows to entice new subscribers.\n",

            "Paragraph: In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones. These weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They’ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\" She knew that Rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I’m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It’s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient. And if Rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren’t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. \"The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,\" the team writes.\n",

            "Paragraph: Image copyright Ryan Pierse Image caption US swimmer Michael Phelps, winner of 19 Olympic gold medals, sporting cupping bruises on his shoulders and back A number of Olympians - including the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, Michael Phelps - have been photographed with large red circles on their skin. What are they, and why is everyone suddenly going dotty over them? The mark of an Olympic athlete, at least at Rio 2016, seems to be a scattering of perfectly round bruises. Swimmers and gymnasts, particularly from Team USA, are among those seen sporting the mysterious dots. No, not paintballing misadventures or love bites - they are the result of a practice known as \"cupping\"; an ancient therapy where heated cups are placed on the skin. So how is 'cupping' done? The technique, which is a form of acupuncture, is done by lighting flammable liquid in a glass cup. Once the flame goes out, the drop in temperature creates suction which sticks the cups to the body. The suction pulls the skin away from the body and promotes blood flow - and leaves those red spots, which typically last for three or four days. Why are some Olympians using it? Athletes say they are using it to ease aches and pains, and to help with recovery from the physical toil of constant training and competing. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alex Naddour and other members of the US gymnastics team told USA Today they swear by cupping Image copyright AFP Image caption Michael Phelps sported some particularly pronounced marks There are plenty of other recovery techniques competitors use - including sports massage, sauna, ice baths and compression garments - but US gymnast Alex Naddour told USA Today that cupping was \"better than any money I've spent on anything else\". \"That's been the secret that I have had through this year that keeps me healthy,\" Naddour told the paper, adding that it had saved him from \"a lot of pain\". His team captain Chris Brooks added that many on the squad had started \"do-it-yourself\" cupping, with cups that can be suctioned with a pump rather than with a flame. \"You're like, 'OK, I'm sore here,'\" said Brooks. \"Throw a cup on, and your roommate will help you or you can do it yourself.\" The marks visible on Michael Phelps as he competed in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay on Sunday had people on social media speculating what they might be, with some guessing he might have been playing paintball or attacked by a giant octopus. Image copyright Above Average Twitter Who else does this? It's not only athletes who use cupping. The practice has long proved popular among A-listers in search of the next best therapy. In 2004, Gwyneth Paltrow appeared at a film premiere revealing the signs of cupping on her back. Image copyright LFI Image caption Gwyneth Paltrow with cupping marks in 2004 Justin Bieber, Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Aniston have all been photographed with what look like cupping marks. And Nicole Ritchie made her dad, singer Lionel Richie try it - although pictures suggest he might not entirely have enjoyed it. Cupping has also become an increasingly available and popular treatment in beauty parlours and spas, as well as traditional Chinese medicine shops where it is commonly on offer. Doesn't it hurt? The British Acupuncture Council (BAcC) says cupping is not painful, and the red marks left on the skin are caused by blood being drawn to the surface and small capillaries rupturing. Image copyright Thinkstock On the other hand, swimmer Michael Phelps was filmed wincing as he underwent the technique in a recent advert , and other Olympians have posted pictures of what look like painful cupping sessions on social media. Belarusian swimmer Pavel Sankovich also posted a photo of his legs covered in a dozen of the little domes. Image copyright Pavel Sankovich Instagram The BAcC warns that on \"rare occasions\" the hot cups can cause mild burns. It has published rules of practice for cupping, and advises people only to visit properly-trained practitioners who are accredited members of their organisation. So does it actually work? Practitioners claim cupping helps with a huge variety of ailments from muscle problems to cellulite. While there have \"certainly been satisfied customers for 3,000 years\", Professor Edzard Ernst from the department of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter previously told the BBC it was not a proven medical treatment. He insisted it was a relatively safe practice, but added: \"There is no evidence for its efficacy. It has not been submitted to clinical trials.\"\n",

We have nothing against dried pasta -- there is definitely a time and a place for it, and in fact, sometimes there's nothing better for a quick and satisfying weeknight dinner. If you've ever tried homemade pasta, however, you understand what pasta is really all about. Homemade pasta is a little chewy and very tender; it really does just melt in your mouth. It may sound difficult, but making your own pasta is actually much easier than you might think. If you have a pasta maker, the most difficult part is probably setting up the machinery (you can also make pasta by hand). Whichever route you take, homemade is as simple as mixing together two or three ingredients. The basic process consists of mixing flour and water -- and egg if you want -- together, kneading it into dough, letting the dough rest for a while, and cutting noodles. As author and food blogger David Lebovitz says, pasta dough isn't as fussy as pastry or bread dough. It's \"simple and forgiving, [and] one of those recipes that’s more about technique than ingredients or quantities.\" If you're still not convinced, here's something to consider: Homemade pasta is so satisfying that it needs little else to make a completely delicious meal, especially if you've added something flavorful, like spinach or beets, to the pasta dough. Sometimes, a drizzle of good, fruity olive oil is all you need. So you can put the energy you might spend on an elaborate sauce into the homemade noodles. Ready to tackle this deceptively easy challenge? We've rounded up 15 homemade pasta recipes to get you started. We're warning you, though: once you go homemade pasta, you'll have a hard time going back.\n",

Yes, it’s very sad. Yes, this stings. No, we’re still not completely okay with this. The ride isn’t necessarily going away forever. Instead, it’s getting a makeover, and will open up ~sometime~ in 2017 as a brand new Guardians of the Galaxy Ride, Mission: Breakout.

It includes destinations that are completely visa-free and the ones that require visa on arrival. Germany's passport, which allows its holders to travel to 158 countries around the world without having to get a visa before departure, is top of the list. The country held the same position last year but it now offers one less destination compared to 2016. The Swedish and Singaporean passports both allow its holders to visit 157 destinations. However, Sweden ranks higher on the list because 123 of these destinations are completely visa-free (rather than visa on arrival) while for Singapore, it's 122. The rest of the top 10 is made up of European countries including Denmark, Finland, France, Spain, Switzerland, Norway and the UK. South Korea, which had previously been the most powerful passport out of the Asian nations, fell to 24 this year. Afghanistan has the least powerful passport out of 199 countries, allowing its nationals to travel to just 23 countries and regions without having to obtain a visa beforehand. It's followed by Pakistan, Iraq and Syria, which are open to 26, 28 and 29 countries and regions respectively. The list is updated each year and will vary according to the visa-waivers that were signed during the year. The Marshall Islands for example, opened up to 35 new regions compared to last year. Similarly, Peru also added 33 countries to its roster of visa-free destinations. Both of these are a reflection of increased travel freedom between countries. According to a new World Openness Score forming part of the rankings, which measures the freedom of mobility around the globe, there has been an increase in open borders since last year. 1.

            "Paragraph: Spring cleaning has arrived, but before you spend hours on end tidying up, use these experts' shortcuts for how to get everything from your mattress to your bathtub looking brand new again. The Liquor That Doubles as a Mattress Refresher Hold the tonic and lime -- vodka has a new use that has less to do with your Saturday night and more to do with where you sleep when you arrive home. That's right, vodka can be used as a way to clean your mattress, which is often an overlooked task, even though you sleep -- i.e., sweat -- on it every night. The alcohol kills odor-causing bacteria while it also disinfects the mattress—unlike cleaning sprays that often only mask smells with a scent. Not to mention a cheap 750-ml bottle (25.36 fluid ounces) of vodka costs less than $10, while a 16.9-fluid-ounce cleaning spray costs around $5 and won't last nearly as long. This is why Jolie Kerr, cleaning expert and author of My Boyfriend Barfed in My Handbag and Other Things You Can't Ask Martha, suggests vodka as an easy cleaning solution. Simply pour vodka into a spray bottle, distribute it evenly across your mattress by spritzing and leave it to air-dry before remaking your bed. \"The key is to spritz the mattress lightly -- you don't want to saturate it, or else it will never dry,\" says Kerr. The Spray That Gets Rid of Those Unmentionable Bedroom Invaders Researchers at Alexandria University in Egypt found certain essential oils to be effective at killing dust mites—the invisible-unless-under-a-microscope creatures that tend to live in bedding, carpets, furniture and drapes. If you want to keep your allergies at bay, eucalyptus and clove were proven to be the most effective oils for eliminating household dust mites. Add around 10 drops of an oil in with your laundry detergent when you wash your sheets in hot water; fill a spray bottle with 1 quart of water and 20 drops of an oil to spray on upholstery; or, put baking soda in a sifter and add in 10 drops of an essential oil to shake across carpeting. Then leave the mixture on the floor for 30 minutes and vacuum it up. The Fruit That Cleans Your Microwave in a Zap It's bad enough that you completely blackened your bag of popcorn, but even worse when that distinct smell makes its way into every food you put in the microwave for weeks afterward -- even after you have cleaned the microwave with soap and water. Tricky smells, such as from burnt foods, are easily absorbed into the microwave and take more than a good scouring to get rid of. Kerr says the easiest way to deodorize a microwave and clean it is to cut a lemon in half, sprinkle it with some kosher salt and then to scrub the microwave interior with it. \"The scent of the lemon, combined with the citric acid will help to neutralize any lingering odors.\" And for those of us who just wish the smell would go away on its own, this trick comes pretty close: Put a bowl of white vinegar in the microwave and shut the door. \"You don't even need to turn it on,\" says Kerr. \"Just let the vinegar work its magic for an hour, or so, and the smells will be gone.\" The Salon Staple That'll Keep Your Bathroom Sparkling Sure, you've heard of Bar Keepers Friend as a way to remove rust rings from your bathtub, but there's an easier solution to prevent those stubborn marks before they even start. Coat the undersides of your shaving-cream can, metal soap dish or any other rust-causing culprits with clear nail polish, which puts a protective layer between the item and your pearly white tub. The DIY Cleaning Solution That Works in Any Room If your household is prone to drink and/or food spills, don't waste money going through containers upon containers of cleaning wipes. Instead, make your own for a fraction of the cost with Fabulessly Frugal's easy recipe, which includes items that are probably already lying around your kitchen: paper towels, vinegar, water, a few drops of dish soap and of an essential oil (although not necessary, the latter helps to mask the smell of vinegar). Then store them in Tupperware, or in an old container of store-bought wipes, and you'll be a whole lot happier when you get your monthly bank statement. The Pillowcase Reuse That's a Breeze Ceiling fans do require a little extra effort to clean (\"Where's my step ladder, again?\"), but Jill Nystul, the blogger behind One Good Thing by Jillee, shows us how to tackle the task in 30 seconds or less. Hook an old pillowcase over one fan blade at a time and wipe it backward. This removes all the grime and traps it inside the pillowcase without it falling to the ground—or, worse, in your eyes -- so there are finally no more, \"Oops, I have to re-sweep my floor,\" moments.\n",

            "Paragraph: Image caption The Micro Bit will be more than double the price of the Raspberry Pi Zero mini-computer The BBC Micro Bit, the tiny computing device designed to get children coding, is going on sale to the general public. The device is already being delivered, free, to one million Year 7 children in schools across the UK. Now it will also be available to buy from the various partners in the project for £12.99. Commercial availability of the Micro Bit follows the signing of a licensing deal with the device's manufacturer, the Leeds-based company, element 14. The firm says it will only sell them in batches of 90. But retailers including Microsoft, the Technology Will Save Us organisation and Sciencescope will offer individual devices. Image caption Owners of the Micro Bit can write code for it via a website designed by Microsoft Element 14 is part of Premier Farnell, one of the distributors of the very successful Raspberry Pi barebones computer. Richard Curtin, strategic alliance director at element 14, is expecting a similar reception for the Micro Bit. \"It's going to be huge,\" he told me.\"We've already got a pipeline of orders including foreign governments who've seen what has happened in the UK.\" The Micro Bit was meant to be the flagship of the BBC's Make It Digital season last year but suffered a number of delays. It started arriving in schools this spring and the BBC says it has now been delivered to about 80% of schools and roughly 750,000 Year 7 children (11 and 12-year olds). While I have heard plenty of enthusiasm from those children who have got their hands on it - and there are already plenty of exciting projects on display - there have also been frustrations from teachers. Media caption Rishworth School sent a Micro Bit into the stratosphere A number have told me that the Micro Bit has arrived far too late in the school year to be of much use - \"starting after half term, it's come far too late to get proper use out of it, plus concerns about handling/failures\" was one comment this morning. But another teacher said this: \"Got ours just before Easter hols. Kids are loving using them and are even buying add-ons for them, building projects at home etc.\" It is late in the year - although the Micro Bits belong to the children who will take them home over the summer holidays. Image caption Until now, only Year 7 schoolchildren in the UK had access to their own Micro Bits The hope must be that their enthusiasm will continue as they join Year 8 in September, though of course there is a risk that their devices will be lost or broken by then. The real test, however, will be whether schools and parents decide that the next Year 7 children will benefit from getting their own Micro Bits. They could decide it is worthwhile investing in the devices now they are going to be available to buy. And there is also the prospect of some being made available for free again. Element 14 tells me it is paying a licensing fee for the use of the BBC and Micro Bit brands - but that all of that money will be going to a charitable trust with the aim of providing an educational legacy. The Micro Bit is entering what is now quite a crowded market for simple educational computing devices. But if it does prove as good a seller as the Raspberry Pi, then a windfall for the charity could mean more Year 7 children getting their hands on one.\n",

            "Paragraph: Five Nights at Freddy’s creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series. For the past couple of years, horror gaming fans have been able to look forward to one new entry in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series after another, with four core games, one RPG spinoff, and a novel released so far. The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months. According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it’s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\" Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it’s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy’s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon’s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game. Cawthon’s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy’s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn’t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn’t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues. Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy’s games early, and it wouldn’t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon’s post to the contrary. With October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location‘s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more \"kid-friendly,\" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision. Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices. Source: Scott Cawthon\n",

            "Paragraph: The Queen’s cousin has become the first member of the British Royal Family to come out as gay. Lord Ivar Mountbatten has revealed that he is now dating a man after a lifelong struggle with his sexuality. Prince Harry previously joked that he might try a relationship with a man if it doesn’t work out with women. Mountbatten is the Queen’s cousin, the great great great grandson of Queen Victoria and the great-nephew of Earl Mountbatten of Burma. The 53-year-old came out in an interview with his boyfriend James Coyle, 54. The couple met on a skiing holiday in March, and the relationship has been a key landmark for them both. He is the first member of the extended royal family to come out as gay, and whilst he is happier now he’s still finding his feet in his new relationship. \"I am a lot happier now, though I am still not 100% comfortable with being gay,\" he told The Mail on Sunday. \"Being a Mountbatten was never the problem, it was the generation into which I was born. When I was growing up, it was known as ‘the love that dare not speak its name’, but what’s amazing now is how far we have all come in terms of acceptance.\" \"Coming out is such a funny phrase but it’s what I suppose I did in a rather roundabout way, emerging to a place I’m happy to be. I have struggled with my sexuality and in some ways I still do; it has been a real journey to reach this point.\" \"Simply talking about it in public is a huge step for me. Up to this point, I have had a heterosexual lifestyle, so living with a man is really new. One step at a time.\" The father of three divorced from his wife Penelope Thompson after 17 years of marriage in 2011. Whilst having a boyfriend has provided the Lord with some learning curves, it’s also been a blessing in disguise. His daughters like having another man in the house, rather than a step-mother. And his ex, Penelope Thomson, goes to yoga with his new boyfriend. Coyle said: \"I went to a village yoga class with Penny and people thought I was her new boyfriend. She had to tell them: no, he’s Ivar’s, not mine.\" Whilst the couple have a strict no public affection rule, they are now out to all of their friends and family. \"In different ways, we both struggled. Now everyone in our family knows and could not be more supportive.\" said Mountbatten. \"Neither of us wanted to have relationships which were transitory; the stereotypical view of gay relationships is that they are too fleeting, too frequent.\" \"Finding James means I will not have to lie to anyone or grow old on my own.\" Last year, Prince William visited a school to participate in a lesson to tackle homophophic bullying. The Queen is believed to have supported same-sex marriage. When a newspaper claimed that she opposed gay people marrying, Buckingham Palace sent journalists PinkNews articles claiming that she supports equality.\n",

            "Paragraph: A Venezuelan university professor and aspiring lawmaker for the socialist party has set social media ablaze by suggesting that her fellow countrymen cope with medicine shortages by planting tylenol bushes in their backyards. Speaking at a campaign rally televised on state TV last Saturday, congressional hopeful Rona del Valle Gómez called on Venezuelans to deal with the shortages by returning to their ancestral roots and \"planting an acetaminophen bush.\" Acetaminophen is a synthetic drug used to relieve pain and reduce fever. It’s the active ingredient in Tylenol and dozens of other similar medicines. And it doesn’t grow on a bush, no matter how good the soil. The aspiring lawmaker’s home gardening advice immediately went viral on Venezuela’s social media, where critics of President Nicolas Maduro are constantly trolling the socialist government for evidence of madness and material for mockery. After days of taking a beating on Twitter, Facebook and the Latin American media, del Valle Gómez released a communique written in impossibly small font explaining that she had meant to be folksy in calling on folks to plant acetaminophen. What she was really referring to was a plant with similar medicinal properties, called \"Boldo Paraguayo.\" The rest of the educator’s barely legible clarification, which was published this morning on her Twitter account then quickly removed, professes her undying loyalties to Hugo Chávez and says something about Venezuelans never surrendering to their adversaries, the \"ultra-rightwingers whose only goal is to destabilize our legitimate government.\" Venezuela’s government has blamed the country’s shortages on transnational companies that are trying to force the country into a dependence on foreign imports.\n",

            "Paragraph: He’s definitely a victim but not of the sort that several media organizations seem to think. An investigation by France24 discovered that images of the same man have appeared in numerous listings of terrorist attack fatalities in incidents including the Orlando shootings and last month’s EgyptAir crash. In fact, Gizmodo says his photo and description have appeared in at least three attacks this year alone, gaining mention in prominent publications including the New York Times and the BBC. And he’s not always the victim. During a June shooting in Mexico in which police officers fired at civilians, the man’s photo was widely circulated across social media with posters claiming he ordered the attack. However, it turns out the man, whose real name France24 did not reveal, is very much alive. He claims to be the victim of an elaborate, ongoing prank but France24 says he may also be a scam artist who is suffering from a bit of revenge from those he ripped off – a number of individuals told the publication he has tricked them out of sums upwards of $1,000. For his part, the man in question is a resident of Mexico who admitted he’s currently \"embroiled in legal troubles,\" according to Gizmodo. \"My photo is everywhere because of someone who started it as a prank after a legal dispute,\" he told France24. Ironically, the man says he’s made several attempts to contact places like the BBC and the NYT to have them remove his images from these false news reports but that none of the organizations have returned his calls. He’s also basically thrown up his arms in surrender when it comes to pursuing any potential legal action against these alleged \"prank\" photo stunts, saying, \"nothing ever happens in these kind of cases.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: The competition to win viewers is stiff among three of the biggest online movie and TV platforms: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. But Hulu just made some major announcements that put it ahead of its competitors.At a presentation this morning, the brand confirmed rumors that starting in 2017, it will begin livestreaming TV shows to subscribers. For anyone who has resigned themselves to watching already aired shows on the site, this news is gold. CEO Mike Hopkins hasn't said yet which networks and shows will be available when the new programming starts, but we're crossing our fingers that the major broadcast (Fox, NBC, ABC) and cable (TBS, Bravo, Showtime) networks will join in.Hulu also announced that, like Amazon and Netflix, it's expanding its movie library. It has signed a deal for exclusive rights to a Beatles documentary from Ron Howard, which will be the first of many new documentary movies to be available on the platform. And for those who miss Dr. Mindy Lahiri, the fifth season of The Mindy Project will also be returning to Hulu.While Netflix and Amazon are still winning when it comes to originally produced shows and movies, Hulu is making a strong statement with livestreaming. If it could just get HBO on board (which isn't very likely ), all of our viewing woes would be solved!\n",

            "Paragraph: We're just as tired of overly-retouched ads as the next girls, so we've been championing Rag & Bone's DIY Project since it started back in 2011. As the campaign closes its third year, we're thrilled that the latest slew of ads starring Julia Stegner are as refreshing as ever. In case you're not familiar with the concept, the DIY Project lets models take complete control of the shoot, including the styling and actual photography. Rag & Bone simply gives the chosen model a bag of clothes and a digital camera -- the rest is entirely up to her, including whether or not she wears makeup. With Julia Stegner's new shots, the results are fresh, personal and seemingly makeup-free. Thus far, we've seen gorgeous Rag & Bone styling interpretations by industry powerhouses like Lily Aldridge, Karolina Kurkova, Miranda Kerr, Candice Swanepoel and Carolyn Murphy. As for Stegner, her beachy shoot features her adorable pup and one of the most effortless haircuts we've seen in a while. With more publications swearing off Photoshop (Verily magazine might just be our favorite) and more brands eschewing makeup in ad campaigns, we're happy that a project like this can add to this positive movement in the fashion industry.\n",

            "Paragraph: A Republican elector in Texas says he will not formally vote for Donald Trump for president when members of the Electoral College meet on Dec. 19. In an op-ed published by The New York Times, Christopher Suprun, a paramedic in Texas, argued that the president-elect has demonstrated each day that \"he is not qualified for the office.\" Mr. Trump, Suprun wrote, has failed to unite the country as President George W. Bush did after 9/11. Instead, he has ranted and attacked the cast of NBC’s \"Saturday Night Live.\" \"He tweets day and night, but waited two days to offer sympathy to the Ohio State community after an attack there. He does not encourage civil discourse, but chooses to stoke fear and create outrage,\" he wrote. \"This is unacceptable. For me, America is that shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan envisioned. It has problems. It has challenges. These can be met and overcome just as our nation overcame Sept. 11.\" Suprun went on to say Mr. Trump \"lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief\" and lambasted him for how he \"urged violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign. He speaks of retribution against his critics.\" He added that the election of Mr. Trump is \"not yet a done deal\" and he urged other electors to \"vote their conscience\" and unify behind a GOP alternative like Ohio Gov. John Kasich. While a few dozen states have laws that try to bind the votes of presidential electors, Texas is not one of them. Suprun would be known as a \"faithless elector\" and while there have been some in previous elections, they have never changed the outcome. Harvard University law professor Larry Lessig has announced that he will provide free counsel to electors who want to oppose  Mr.Trump, according to Politico. It’s called \"The Electors Trust\" and it will offer a platform for electors to plan how to stop the president-elect. \n",

            "Paragraph: Jorah gonna want to read this, \"Game of Thrones\" fans. With our favorite characters in jeopardy every week on \"GoT,\" we're always looking for any clue or indication of who's about to go next. And no one looks more in danger these days than Jorah Mormont. In addition to his life-threatening greyscale, actor Iain Glen is now playing a media mogul, à la Richard Branson, on a new show called \"Cleverman.\" So now we're really worried. Does Glen's participation in \"Cleverman\" hint at Jorah's fate? \"I don't think you can draw that conclusion,\" Glen reassured The Huffington Post when addressing our concerns. (Thank the old gods and the new!) The actor explained that, although it appears \"Game of Thrones\" has a long production process, it's really only shot for half of the year with two units working in tandem. Contrary to popular belief, Glen says new projects are not a good indicator of whether or not a character doesn't make it on the HBO series. \"They've always been amenable to actors doing other work around it. Your guess is as good as mine as to whether Ser Jorah survives into the future. They keep us painfully in the dark, so well just have to see,\" he said. Even if this season could mark the end of Mormont, fans can take comfort in the fact that Glen's new show is a lot like \"Game of Thrones.\" \"Cleverman\" is an Australian-New Zealand fantasy series about what happens when the world of mythology collides with our own. Like \"GoT,\" it explores class and politics, and there's even some monsters and heart-eating, too. Yum, right? Though \"Cleverman\" may not have the same budget as \"Thrones,\" Glen says a big similarity is that the show's supernatural aspects enhance the story rather than distract from it. \"I think in 'Cleverman,' there are these supernatural elements in it, but you never get to the point where they bounce you out of the story and say, 'Well, I don't really believe that situation,'\" he told HuffPost. Glen enjoyed shooting and would be totally up for Season 2 if it happens, which is fine with us. If we don't have to worry about Jorah, then now our \"Cleverman\" watch begins. UPDATE: \"Cleverman\" has been renewed for Season 2, according to Deadline. Production for six more episodes will begin later this year.\n",

            "Topic: 14 Ineffective Exercises You Should Stop Doing\n",
            "Paragraph: Many people are looking to transform their body. Creating a workout routine that will allot them time and quick results. Fitting a diet to the ideal work out regiment can end up being rough. Its even more difficult to stick to it. There are lots of exercises that you may or may not know about. Depending on your own fitness goal some of the exercises you’re doing may not have a positive effect, if any effect on your own body. This list contains some of the exercises that are most inefficient and why. Some of them may shock you and are extremely common. #13 was a surprise to me... 1. Tricep Bench Dips Tricep bench dips focus on building strength in the triceps. In actuality this exercise puts unnecessary stress on the shoulders. It is not a natural position for the arms to be in. Instead just do regular dips. They are safer and work out the entire arm and not just the triceps. Another alternative to tricep bench dips is the triangle push-up. It targets not only the triceps, but also engages muscles in your chest, shoulders and core. 2. Crunches Many people think the crunch is the ultimate ab exercise. Its not. The crunch only works out the top of the abs. So if you are looking for six pack abs and want to get rid of those love handles, this exercise is not going to cut it. In addition, it causes back and neck problems and thats the last thing anyone wants. Try the plank as a alternative. The plank decreases the risk of lower back pain as your get older, as an extra bonus to rock hard abs. 3. Pull Ups On top of being one of the hardest exercises to do, pull ups can be dangerous, because of the position the body is in. To start a pull up, you must begin from a dead hang then pull all of your body weight up . This puts stress on the shoulders leading to rotary cuff tears. Try doing inverted rows. Theyre like pull ups just on an angle. This way there is less strain on the shoulder and this helps strengthen the back. 4. Leg Press The leg press is just simply unrealistic. When are you ever in this particular position in your daily activities? Throwing hundreds of pounds on top of your legs can have a real negative effect on your knees. The leg press only works on the hamstring and quads. Clockwork Lunges work out all the muscles in your leg and you dont need weight or a machine to do them. 5. Pec Deck/Chest Fly The chest fly is usually done on a machine. Im sure youve seen that one person in the gym at this machine, face scrunched up and snarling to complete a rep. Thats because this machine and exercise puts you in an awkward position. Though you are sitting your chest is sticking out and you shoulders are pulled back, which can and will lead to shoulder injury. 6. Roman Chair Sit Ups Taking a classic exercise and making it more difficult is not always beneficial. The roman chair sit up is an example. You start in an elevated position and lower your upper body to a position leaving it suspended in the air. This puts a great amount of pressure on the hips and can hurt your back if you got to low.Try bent over cable crossovers. This exercise works on the same muscles as the chest fly without the risk of injured joint. If you cant make it to the gym, traditional sit ups are the best alternative. 7. Round Back Deadlifts/Barbell Rows Round back deadlift just sounds like an exercise that should not be done. People who do this exercise are looking for a tighter butt. They end up with lower back injuries. The weight pulling on your arms also can cause severe shoulder injuries. Squats can help with the gluteal muscles with out the weights. Just make sure you dont go to low during squats, as to avoid other joint problems. 8. Behind the Neck Barbell Press By now you should know that the shoulder are vulnerable in almost every other exercise. Behind the neck barbell presses/Lat pulls cause rotary cuff tears. Though results can be seen from this doing this exercise, the risk of injury is high. Traditional military press will do the trick. In a standing or seated position, raise dumbbells or a bar over head then bring it back down to chest level. This will also help develop your delts (upper shoulder muscles). 9. Tricep Kickbacks Tricep kickbacks look simple, but the fact is their useless. This workout is an attempt to get rid of the flab on the back of the arm. The position that the body is in puts pressure on the back and restricts movement. Your triceps wont get the work out needed to develop. Try bench pressing on a decline bench and push ups to work out our triceps. 10. Shoulder Shrugs Here is another exercise that seems simple but can be detrimental. Shoulder shrugs are not good for, you guessed it, the shoulders. Along with potential shoulder injury, shoulder shrugs work out the trapezious muscle (back of the neck). If done too much youll look like a no neck gorilla. If you work in an office sitting at a computer all day, surprisingly your trapezious really dont need much attention. An alternative to shoulder shrugs are lateral dumbbell raises and farmers walk. 11. Superman Back Extensions Superman back extensions are a sure way to hurt your back for good.This exercise requires you to lay flat on your stomach and lift your arms and legs off the ground using the muscles in your back. You can only move a few inches which does nothing to develop muscle. The position strains your spine often causing chronic pain. There are really no benefits to this exercise, so delete it out of your repetoire. 12. Wall Sits Wall sits provide little to no aesthetic, performance, or health related benefits. Your knees take a lot of the pressure. There is no need to sit on a wall in every day life so why do it in your work out routine? Instead try goblet box squats.. Grab a low sitting stool and a dumbbell. With the dumbbell in hand squat until your butt touched the stool, hold that position without actually sitting for a few seconds then stand back up. 13. Light Dumbbell Exercises Using 3-5 lbs dumbbells for any exercise is useless. Youre not generating enough resistance to engage whatever muscles youre trying to work out. Try to pick up something a little heavier. A nice alternative to weights is a resistance band. Resistance bands give you the resistance to engage muscles with out actually carrying anything heavy. You can use a resistance band almost anywhere, at work, home and the gym. 14. Mountain Climbers Mountain Climbers get the heart pumping and is an exercise that yields results, but there is a down side. This exercise puts a significant amount of weight on your shoulders and wrist. Mountain climber also promote poor posture. Single leg planks are an alternative that give you the same results, with out the possibility of injury. Get in the plank position and lift one leg a few inches off the ground.\n",

            "Topic: 10 Bizarre Claims People Make to Avoid Paying Taxes\n",
            "Paragraph: Resistance to taxes is baked into Americans' DNA. After all, it was cries of \"taxation without representation\" that spurred the American Revolution. Tax protests have continued on and off ever since, from the Whiskey Rebellion to Vietnam War-era tax resisters to the \"sovereign citizen\" movement. People object to paying taxes for all kinds of reasons, from opposition to certain policies to not recognizing the government's authority to collect taxes in the first place, but the IRS isn't having it. No matter what you read on the internet or your weird Uncle Bob says, you can't get out of paying taxes without suffering consequences. \"The IRS and the courts hear many outlandish arguments from people trying to avoid their legal filing and tax obligations,\" IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement. \"Taxpayers should avoid unscrupulous promoters of false tax-avoidance arguments because taxpayers end up paying what they owe plus potential penalties and interest mandated by law.\" Now, that doesn't mean there aren't things you can do to legally avoid taxes. Taking all your deductions or moving money into tax-sheltered accounts like a 401K are perfectly acceptable ways to lower your tax bill. It's when you get into weirder tax avoidance strategies that you run into problems. (Note: Not paying your taxes can have serious implications for your credit. Check out our quick guide for keeping your taxes from messing with your credit. While you're at it, you can also get your two free credit scores, updated every 14 days.) Trying to claim that filing a tax return is optional, that you aren't really a citizen of the U.S., or that only certain types of income are taxable will backfire. When you submit a frivolous return or slam the IRS with other off-the-wall requests the result may be a fine of $5,000 to $25,000. Plus, you could also be prosecuted for tax evasion, a felony punishable by prison time and penalties of up to $250,000. The IRS spends a lot of time and energy debunking various convoluted anti-tax arguments, and it's collected dozens of them in a document titled \"The Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments.\" Below, we've highlighted 10 of the more bizarre reasons why people say they shouldn't have to pay taxes. 1. Filing a Return & Paying Taxes Is Voluntary The first and perhaps most direct argument against the U.S. tax system is the idea that filing a return and paying taxes is voluntary. Primary points include court cases like Flora v. United States, in which the term \"voluntary\" is used to describe how the tax system is based on \"voluntary assessment and payment, not upon distraint.\" But when the IRS says filing a return or paying taxes is \"voluntary\" what it really means is that a taxpayer has the right to determine his or her tax liability by completing the appropriate forms, as opposed to having the government complete the forms and determine the bill. It doesn't mean you have the option to opt out of the system entirely. 2. The Money They Earned Isn't Really Income According to this anti-tax argument, the money you receive for working isn't technically income. Rather, you're engaged in an equal exchange of your labor for fair market wages, and thus there's no \"gain\" to be taxed. In this view, the government only has the right to tax gains or profit, not wages. In reality, the IRS is allowed to tax virtually all your income, whether it's dividend income from stocks or wages you receive from your employer. Exceptions include gifts and inheritances (though large estates may have to pay an estate tax), child support, life insurance benefits, and welfare payments. 3. Taxes Are Against Their Religion You may not believe in paying taxes, but the IRS isn't buying it. Though churches and other religious institutions are exempt from taxes, the same does not apply to individual taxpayers. Allowing people to opt out of taxes on religious grounds would cripple the tax system. In the United States v. Lee, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \"[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\" 4. Paying Taxes Violates the Fifth Amendment Some argue that including financial information on a return may bring unlawful or illegal activity to light, thereby forcing a taxpayer to forego their Fifth Amendment protections. The IRS calls this a \"blanket assertion\" of constitutional privilege. The agency asserts that there are no constitutional grounds for the refusal to file a tax return based on the Fifth Amendment. In cases like the United States v. Sullivan and the United States v. Neff, the courts back the IRS's position. 5. Paying Taxes Is a Form of Slavery The U.S. has prohibited involuntary servitude (except as punishment for a crime) since 1865, when the 13th Amendment was ratified. Since then, some anti-tax protestors have tried to equate paying taxes to slavery, arguing that having to send some of their money to the IRS is a constitutional violation. Even prominent politicians have evoked this absurd anti-tax argument. \"If we tax you at 50% you are half slave, half free,\" Rand Paul said in 2015. But the IRS and the courts have declared the \"taxes equals slavery\" claim bogus. On the flip side, arguments that African-Americans and Native Americans can claim a tax credit as reparations for slavery and other forms of oppression are invalid. While there have been serious arguments that the U.S. should pay reparations to the descendants of former slaves, the government has not taken any such action. 6. The 16th Amendment Doesn't Count The 16th Amendment to the Constitution is short and to the point: \"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\" Yet some tax protestors argue the 16th Amendment is invalid because it was not properly ratified or that Ohio was not properly a state at the time it voted for the amendment. (Ohio has been a state since 1803; the amendment was ratified in 1913.) \"Proponents mistakenly believe that courts have refused to address this issue,\" the IRS noted. \"There were enough states ratifying the Sixteenth Amendment even without Ohio to complete the number needed for ratification. Furthermore, after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the income tax laws.\" 7. Their State Isn't Part of the United States Among the goofier anti-tax arguments is the assertion that only people who live in the District of Columbia, in federal territories, or on Indian reservations or military bases have to pay federal income tax. Everyone else is supposedly a citizen of a \"sovereign\" state, not the U.S., which means they're exempt from federal income tax. Not so, says the IRS. \"The Internal Revenue Code imposes a federal income tax upon all United States citizens and residents, not just those who reside in the District of Columbia, federal territories, and federal enclaves,\" the IRS explained. 8. The IRS Is Secretly a Private Corporation Some conspiracy theorists are convinced the IRS isn't actually part of the federal government at all. Supposedly, it's a private corporation masquerading as a government agency, and it actually has no authority to enforce the tax code. In the 2002 case Edwards v. Commissioner, the court dismissed the claim as \"tax protestor gibberish.\" 9. They've Rejected Their Citizenship You can't reject your U.S. citizenship or claim to be a \"free born citizen\" of a particular state in order to get out of paying taxes. \"Claims that individuals are not citizens of the United States but are solely citizens of a sovereign state and not subject to federal taxation have been uniformly rejected by the courts,\" according to the IRS. Even if you were to formally renounce your U.S. citizenship (which involves appearing in person at a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country), you still may not be able to escape your tax bill. \"Persons who wish to renounce U.S. citizenship should be aware of the fact that renunciation of U.S. citizenship may have no effect on their U.S. tax or military service obligations,\" the State Department explained. 10. They Aren't Technically a Person In various court cases, this argument has been declared \"meritless\" and \"frivolous and requir[ing] no discussion.\" Here's a tip: If the government is willing to consider a corporation a person, they're definitely going to consider a person a person.\n",

At the time she joined one peculiar website, she had financial struggles, but in just a few years a sugar daddy gave her 2 million dollars! Here is what happened. This site offers rich men to date hottest women if they pay them for each outing. He pays for the food, but to ask a girl out he also has to pay her some money. Ladies put a price on dates. It’s not about sex, at least not right away. Men just pay to find awesome looking girls to go out with them and have fun. Samantha started at 100 dollars per date. She got rather popular on the site, and eventually her price rose up to 5 000 dollars! That’s pretty good. Men pay for your things, food and give you money for just hanging out with them. However, the woman had a business plan in mind and needed money to fund it. One of the sugar daddies decided that this sugar babe is worth it. She wanted to start a cab service with hot women drivers. And he invested $2 million into her project. Moreover, she has been hanging out with many wealthy and smart men. She listened carefully to their life stories and asked them for advice. It worked pretty much like a business school for her. However, not all the sugar daddy stories end well. In Africa, these men become the primary sources of HIV infection and in Uganda they even carry out an ad campaign against such a thing.

            "Paragraph: WASHINGTON -- The Montana legislature passed sweeping campaign finance legislation on Wednesday that will require the disclosure of all donors to any independent group spending money on state-level elections. The bipartisan Montana Disclose Act will effectively end the flood of \"dark money\" -- electoral spending by nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors -- that has plagued recent Montana elections. \"Montana elections are about to become the most transparent in the nation, requiring those trying to influence our elections to come out of the dark money shadows,\" Gov. Steve Bullock (D), who plans to sign the bill, said in a statement. \"Our elections should be decided by Montanans, not shadowy dark money groups.\" The bill will require all groups, no matter their tax status, to disclose their donors if they spend money on electoral communications either targeting or mentioning a candidate within 60 days of an election. \"What Montana shows is that the issue of money in politics is really only a partisan issue in Washington, D.C.,\" Adam Smith, spokesman for the campaign finance reform group Every Voice, said. \"People can come together -- Republicans and Democrats -- and pass real effective reforms of the system.\" The path to dark money disclosure in Montana began in 2007, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Wisconsin Right to Life v. Federal Election Commission that nonprofit groups could spend corporate funds on advertising close to an election that mentions a candidate, but does not call for their election or defeat. The ruling was a precursor to the 2010 Citizens United decision that openly freed corporations to spend money on elections. The 2007 ruling spurred the creation of nonprofits that accept corporate money and play a role in federal and state politics. In Montana, Western Tradition Partnership, a Colorado-based anti-environmental group, took center stage. Western Tradition Partnership (which would change its name to American Tradition Partnership in 2010) began spending money in Montana elections, largely in Republican primaries, in 2008 and continued to spend into the 2010 and 2012 campaigns. After complaints and investigations by public officials, a box of the group’s stolen documents turned up in a meth house in Colorado. The documents, as reported by ProPublica and PBS’s Frontline, revealed an extensive effort to illegally coordinate with candidates in Montana and Colorado elections. The revelation sparked an investigation in Montana, where the group was found to have violated election laws, and an outcry from politicians. The state legislature debated a bipartisan bill introduced by Republican state Sen. Jim Peterson to end dark money in state elections in 2013. That bill failed. After winning the 2012 gubernatorial election, Bullock made disclosure legislation a priority. He had fought with Western Tradition Partnership in his previous post as attorney general. The group had challenged the state’s centuries-old ban on corporate money in elections after Citizens United opened the door to corporate electoral spending, and Bullock fought back. The state ban on corporate election spending was enacted after the mining magnates known as the \"Copper Kings\" spent freely from their corporate coffers to buy and sell political offices. Bullock argued that the state’s unique history of corporate corruption should override the Supreme Court’s determination in Citizens United. The top court in Montana agreed, but the Supreme Court sided with Western Tradition Partnership, ending the state’s century-old ban on corporate political spending. In early 2015, Bullock teamed up with Republican state Sen. Duane Ankney to introduce Montana Disclose Act. The bill passed the Senate on the first try and went to the House, where a bipartisan majority of 41 Democrats and 10 Republicans passed it 51-48. The bill was sent to the governor’s desk on Wednesday. The bill overcame opposition from the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, the main political vehicle of the billionaire Koch brothers. Montana is the second state, after California, to enact dark money disclosure laws. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman imposed similar disclosure rules through regulatory action.\n",

            "Topic: Before You Spend $26,000 on Weight-Loss Surgery, Do This - The New Yo...\n",
            "Paragraph: Most doctors — and the diabetes associations — portray diabetes as an incurable disease, presaging a steady decline that may include kidney failure , amputations and blindness , as well as life-threatening heart attacks and stroke. Yet the literature on low-carbohydrate intervention for diabetes tells another story. For instance, a two-week study of 10 obese patients with Type 2 diabetes found that their glucose levels normalized and insulin sensitivity was improved by 75 percent after they went on a low-carb diet. At our obesity clinics, we’ve seen hundreds of patients who, after cutting down on carbohydrates, lose weight and get off their medications. One patient in his 50s was a brick worker so impaired by diabetes that he had retired from his job. He came to see one of us last winter, 100 pounds overweight and panicking. He’d been taking insulin prescribed by a doctor who said he would need to take it for the rest of his life. Yet even with insurance coverage, his drugs cost hundreds of dollars a month, which he knew he couldn’t afford, any more than he could bariatric surgery. Instead, we advised him to stop eating most of his meals out of boxes packed with processed flour and grains, replacing them with meat, eggs, nuts and even butter. Within five months, his blood-sugar levels had normalized, and he was back to working part-time. Today, he no longer needs to take insulin. Another patient, in her 60s, had been suffering from Type 2 diabetes for 12 years. She lost 35 pounds in a year on a low-carb diet, and was able to stop taking her three medications, which included more than 100 units of insulin daily. hemoglobin One small trial found that 44 percent of low-carb dieters were able to stop taking one or more diabetes medications after only a few months, compared with 11 percent of a control group following a moderate-carb, lower-fat, calorie-restricted diet. A similarly small trial reported those numbers as 31 percent versus 0 percent. And in these as well as another, larger, trial A1C , which is the primary marker for a diabetes diagnosis, improved significantly more on the low-carb diet than on a low-fat or low-calorie diet. Of course, the results are dependent on patients’ ability to adhere to low-carb diets, which is why some studies have shown that the positive effects weaken over time. A low-carbohydrate diet was in fact standard treatment for diabetes throughout most of the 20th century, when the condition was recognized as one in which \"the normal utilization of carbohydrate is impaired,\" according to a 1923 medical text . When pharmaceutical insulin became available in 1922, the advice changed, allowing moderate amounts of carbohydrates in the diet. Yet in the late 1970s, several organizations, including the Department of Agriculture and the diabetes association, began recommending a high-carb, low-fat diet, in line with the then growing (yet now refuted ) concern that dietary fat causes coronary artery disease. That advice has continued for people with diabetes despite more than a dozen peer-reviewed clinical trials over the past 15 years showing that a diet low in carbohydrates is more effective than one low in fat for reducing both blood sugar and most cardiovascular risk factors. The diabetes association has yet to acknowledge this sizable body of scientific evidence. Its current guidelines find \" no conclusive evidence \" to recommend a specific carbohydrate limit. The organization even tells people with diabetes to maintain carbohydrate consumption, so that patients on insulin don’t see their blood sugar fall too low. That condition, known as hypoglycemia , is indeed dangerous, yet it can better be avoided by restricting carbs and eliminating the need for excess insulin in the first place. Encouraging patients with diabetes to eat a high-carb diet is effectively a prescription for ensuring a lifelong dependence on medication. At the annual diabetes association convention in New Orleans this summer, there wasn’t a single prominent reference to low-carb treatment among the hundreds of lectures and posters publicizing cutting-edge research. Instead, we saw scores of presentations on expensive medications for blood sugar, obesity and liver problems, as well as new medical procedures, including that stomach-draining system, temptingly named AspireAssist, and another involving \"mucosal resurfacing\" of the digestive tract by burning the inside of the duodenum with a hot balloon. We owe our patients with diabetes more than a lifetime of insulin injections and risky surgical procedures. To combat diabetes and spare a great deal of suffering, as well as the $322 billion in diabetes-related costs incurred by the nation each year, doctors should follow a version of that timeworn advice against doing unnecessary harm — and counsel their patients to first, do low carbs.\n",

            "Paragraph: Face wash, lipstick, makeup, and nail polish often carry labels like \"tested\" and \"clinically-proven.\" Cosmetics like these are big business in the US, constituting about a $60 billion market. But how does the cosmetics industry regulate the safety of its products? In the US, the FDA oversees cosmetics. But unlike drugs (which must get approval before they can be sold), cosmetics do not. As a result, companies that use or sell unsafe ingredients usually only get in trouble if they get caught. According to the FDA's website, it's up to individual companies, rather than the FDA, to ensure their products are safe. Compared to Canada and the European Union, both of whom have pretty strict oversight over cosmetics, the FDA has very few hard-and-fast rules. Here's what is still lurking in our cosmetics: Lipstick The makeup brand Lime Crime came under fire from the FDA in July for having color additives, the single ingredient the FDA does require approval for in cosmetics, in some of its products. \"Color is something that the FDA takes very seriously,\" said Robert Lochhead, a polymer science professor at the University of Southern Mississippi. Lochhead told Business Insider the reason the FDA is so concerned with color additives relative to other chemicals is part of the agency's history: In the 1950s, some of the color additives in food and other materials caused some serious health complications, namely FD&C Orange No. 1, which made many children sick after it was used in Halloween candy. There have also been problems with leads found in lipstick, which is troubling considering how easily ingestible lipstick is. Nail polish In recent years, one of the most controversial chemicals in the cosmetic industry has been a chemical called phthalates. They're found in nail polish — that's what gives them that stretchy, plastic-y feeling — and perfumes. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, phthalates are a known environmental contaminant that could have an impact on human health, though they don't yet have enough conclusive evidence to say exactly how. Face wash Some harmful substances in cosmetics aren't so much causing bodily harm as hurting the environment. Such is the case with plastic microbeads, which are found in a number of face washes and toothpastes. Microbeads were originally used because they're are a good way to exfoliate that don't generally cause rashes. Substituting the microbeads for nut shells, for example, would put a large portion of the population at risk for an allergic reaction. Eye makeup Some eye shadows may contain certain heavy metals, which can pose a problem if the metals are water soluble, meaning they could absorbed into the body through sweat. In a good spot, but still a ways to go Although they only \"prohibit or restrict,\"the use of 11 chemicals, the FDA still faces a lot of pressure to get things right, Karl Bygrave, the Director of Regulatory Affairs for cosmetics company Lush told Business Insider. \"It doesn't feel unregulated,\" he said. Bygrave said for its part, his company does its best to cater to consumer concerns about any potentially harmful chemicals in its products. While he says they only use compounds in their cosmetics that have been proven safe for people in tests, they will sometimes change the ingredients in their products based on consumer preference. In light of a study which suggested a link between preservatives called parabens and cancer (though ultimately no link was actually found), for example, the company opted to swap them out for different ingredients. That's just one company though — and others may not be as careful. As a way to combat the problems in the beauty industry, there seems to be an increased interest in organic beauty products over the last several years, especially in Europe and the US. Sales were projected to reach $15 billion globally in 2015, still just a fraction of the US market.\n",

            "Topic: 'The Good Wife' Costume Designer Daniel Lawson On Why He Hates Dressing Strong Women As Men (PHOTOS)\n",
            "Paragraph: Not since a mini skirt-wearing Calista Flockhart starred as Ally McBeal have I been interested in attorney fashion (save for the sexy suits worn by the men of the aptly titled TV legal drama \"Suits\"). But after hearing a few of my co-workers buzzing about the Armani and Yves Saint Laurent designs on \"The Good Wife,\" I figured why not binge-watch the show on Netflix? Two weeks later and I'm not only caught up in preparation for Season 5's return on Sunday (September 29 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS), but I've become well-versed on the political-legal style evolution of Julianna Margulies' character Alicia Florrick. We've watched Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin's image evolve in the public eye -- everything from their pant suits to their hairstyles and lipstick colors have been profiled. And Margulies' fictional portrayal of a woman who stands by her man during trying times reinforces our attraction to what's on the surface. So how does one bring this element of reality to television? I dialed up \"The Good Wife\" costume designer Daniel Lawson to probe deeper into this theory. Read on to find out what it takes to style one of the most powerful women on the small screen, as well as Lawson's top tips on what we can learn from the ladies and men of Lockhart/Gardner. Can you talk about the transformation of Julianna Margulies' character Alicia over the seasons? First of all, she was a politician's wife and had been involved for so many years doing ribbon cuttings for the local store or whatever it was. She had not been working as a lawyer for years, but once the scandal hit, she had to rework all of these clothes to get back to work. So the first season was all about mixing and matching. After being on the front page for months and months, she did not want to draw attention to herself. She wanted to go into the law firm, be a wall flower, not stand out and draw any more attention. The labels that we used were not incredibly high-end. They were very respectable labels like Ralph Lauren and Elie Tahari. As we got to the second and third seasons, we saw a sense of confidence start to bloom. She had this slight ‘40s silhouette to her look. I was like \"Oh my gosh, she’s Rosie the Riveter!\" She is totally confident with her work, her affair with her boss and sexual life. She had gotten a promotion and was making money. She was able to buy new clothes and put together more full head-to-toe outfits, including wearing more jewelry. And by the time we got into Season 4, she had been working towards becoming a partner and was wearing more high-end and color. Alicia's closet has certainly expanded, but does she ever repeat outfits? Absolutely. Maybe ten percent of her looks are things she’s done in previous episodes. Julianna loves it because she gets to wear an \"old friend,\" and from a character standpoint it makes sense because it’s real. Every piece that's repeated is basic: black pants, black skirts and navy shoes. What makes a great women's suit? Number 1: It has to fit. I know you’ve been told that a million times. But you can go buy a $150 suit from Ann Taylor and have it tailored and altered to you and it’s going to look like an $800 suit. And you can buy a $2000 suit that doesn’t fit you, that hangs off of you like a bag and it’s going to look like it’s not even yours. It’s so important for women and men when budgeting themselves for new clothes -- whether for work or recreational -- to include money for tailoring. Number 2: Go with things that are more classic that will take you from season to season. If that means spending more money on good brand name pieces that will last, then you should do so. And let the trendy pieces that fall in from season to season be what you spice up your look with each year. Number 3: Women need to know if they look better in skirts or trousers. Find the silhouette that works for you and stick with that as best you can. Moving on to Diane. How many brooches does she own? My goal is to bring the pin back [laughs]. She probably has about 30 brooches. There are a couple pins that I just love. Christine [Baranski] knows of a resale shop near her house way up in Connecticut. And she said, \"Darling, they have beautiful pieces there.\" I got them on the phone and we’ve had them ever since. And I know of some vintage stores here in New York. When Christine came in for her first fitting, we had this big 10 foot long table. And it was covered in jewelry. We didn’t even talk about it because we were so into the clothes. She could see that we had tons of jewelry and that we didn’t need to worry about it. The first season, she wanted to wear a signature ring in every episode and then she got tired of it [laughs]. What's your secret to styling such a strong and determined character like Diane? In the pilot, she wore two grey suits. But what I wanted to do with Diane, as well as Alicia and Kalinda, was make them look feminine, yet powerful. I always get frustrated unless it's the character, when a strong woman is dressed up as a man. Christine had a very good point, she said, \"I’m known for my comedy and musical-comedy so I want people to believe me as a lawyer.\" And that was a challenge for me. But I wanted her to be really chic and really elegant. I wanted her to wear the clothes, not have the clothes wear her. I remember we had this crazy red Gaultier blouse and the collar was a belt from a London Fog coat. And we were like is it too much, have we gone too far? We figured out a great way to drape it so that it was edgy and unique. Of course, Christine is so elegant anyway. You can put a burlap bag on her and she’d look great. For Season 4, we have been using Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera, and we also used Lafayette 148 New York. We certainly do Prada and Givenchy for her. Armani is good for both Diane and Alicia. Sometimes Dior on Diane, and YSL is really big for Diane. There is also this amazing clothing line called Number 35 and they’re an English line. I discovered them the second half of the season last year. We’re collaborating on a line called 35 DL. It’s sort of high-end business wear. Hopefully, I’ll be using some of those pieces on the show. Is there anything the actors won't wear? We don’t have issues with brand names, where people are like, \"No, I never want to wear X.\" But you certainly learn what silhouettes work on the actors. I tend not to do big, baggy sleeves on any of the women on the show because on camera it looks sloppy and they look sick. I do find that I slim a lot of women’s shirt sleeves and take fullness out of them because there’s just too much fabric. Last year, we used the peplum a lot and Dior was doing that wonderful nod with their new look. We like slim skirts. We never do A-line skirts. There was that whole vogue for A-line skirts and dresses for women but it doesn’t work on camera. It can work in real life though. How did Kalinda’s boots and skirts become so big? I honestly had no idea it would be such a big thing. Archie Panjabi, who plays Kalinda, wore jeans in the pilot. And I was like you know what, I don’t want her to wear that. It goes back to what I said. She’s strong and tough and really sexy. Why do we have to put her in pants? The producers said she wore boots in the pilot and they liked that. And she wore a slouch boot. So I thought, well if we are going to do a boot, let’s get it up the leg. She came in and really wanted to wear pants. We experimented and finally got her into skirts. We even tried to put her in a regular pump and she was down with it. She got all the way to set, and then turned around and said to me, \"I need the boots. I just don’t feel like Kalinda.\" The actors on this show are brilliant. It’s not just about how it looks on me, but is it right for the character. With Kalinda we combine hard and soft all the time. She may wear leather, but she’ll have on a chiffon blouse. Or she’ll have high leather boots but she’ll have on a buffalo plaid skirt. We’re always trying to create this dichotomy with her looks. I think I have her figured out and then the writers do something. And I think that’s the same way the audience feels, and I want that in her clothes. It’s hard because the skirt and boots have become iconic for her. I want it to always be this element of surprise as with her sexuality. For the longest time we didn’t know that she was a lesbian or had lesbian tendencies. Then she turns around and has a relationship with a guy. What is her go-to brand for boots? A big brand that we’ve been using over the years interspersed with others is Via Spiga. You have to remember that they’re wearing this footwear for up to 14 hours a day. There has to be a comfort level, it can’t be a tortuous. But we did have to have the boots shaped for her. The part that comes up the leg, we’d have that taken in. I’d recommend that to all women. If you’re going to invest in a pair of boots, take them to the shoe maker. It may sound crazy, but I hate when they’re all gaped at the top. It should look like your boots. What are your tips for finding a badass leather jacket like Kalinda's? Don’t have too many bells and whistles. People tend to go for the shiny bright things with a millions zippers and pulls. It may be cool for a second, but for longevity it may be hard to get versatility out of the jacket. Think about the purpose of your leather jacket. Is it to wear outside with a sweater, or a replacement for a sports jacket? Get one that fits your body well over the different layers underneath. I also feel this about leather jackets: If you have one that has a zipper down the front, get one that zips both ways. That’s because when you sit down, even when it’s that butter leather, the jacket wants to bunch up because it wants to splay out over your hips. If you get a zipper that zips up, it will smooth out. Let's discuss the best-dressed man on \"The Good Wife,\" Eli Gold. The thing with Eli I wanted to look like if you touch him he would shatter. He’s so uptight! He wears mostly Dolce & Gabbana, Versace and Paul Smith. I wanted him in two-button suits that feel very snugged to create that stiff look. Normally when a guy buttons a suit jacket and there are two buttons, he buttons just the top. Eli buttons both. The first time I saw that, I told the set costumer to go tell Alan [Cumming] to unbutton that bottom button and he said, \"Nah, I’m going to wear this closed.\" And I wasn't going to go to the mat for that, or argue with the actor about it. But it made sense because if he was going to have 10 buttons, he would button them all up. That’s his thing. His collar and tie are always done up, practically strangling himself. There’s always a perfect knot on the tie, and it’s just like relax, dude. Can you give us a sneak peek into what we can expect from the cast's Season 5 style? We find out that Alicia is going to start her own law firm with Cary [Agos]. She still has the money and ensemble of suits, but heading into the new season, I dial back the color with the uncertainty of what’s to come. I wanted her wardrobe to be more neutral-toned again and Julianna felt that as well. Overall, the clothing will change but it can’t change too drastically because that’s not real. When something drastic happens you don’t go out and buy a whole new wardrobe. I always want the evolution of the look to be steady and methodical. And this season is no different.\n",

            "Paragraph: When it comes to cooking, garlic is one of my favourite ingredients. And it’s such a versatile ingredient that it can be used in almost any savoury dish! Roasted with some proteins, stir-fried in some vegetables, blended into a creamy pasta sauce.... the list goes on and on. Personally, I absolutely love the flavour and aroma of garlic so when a recipe calls for two cloves of garlic, I’ll somehow justify to myself that I really should be putting in five or six. And the best part is that I don’t feel too guilty about it because garlic is healthy! Garlic can be used to help lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and prevent cancer, heart attacks, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. This superfood can also be used to help treat the common cold, the flu, bug bites, fungal infections, and traveller’s diarrhoea. Garlic is great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins, leading many people to consume it after chemotherapy. But while I love cooked garlic, garlic in its raw form is apparently how you’re going to get the best results. This is because heating garlic has been shown to reduce its anticancer properties and inactivate a key enzyme called alliinase. What you’ll want to do to maximise the health benefits of garlic is to crush it up raw, releasing the enzymes that will break down into good organosulfur compounds, and then eat it on an empty stomach. But raw garlic is incredibly pungent, so try this... Take 2-3 garlic cloves, chop up and crush them, and mix it with a tablespoon of honey (also healthy with anti-bacterial properties!). If you can consume it this way on a regular basis, it can go a long way in boosting your immune system!\n",

            "Paragraph: \"Alone Yet Not Alone,\" the controversial Best Original Song nominee from the film of the same name, has had its Oscar nomination rescinded, this according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Board of Governors. The song had come under fire after it was revealed that Bruce Broughton, the composer, was a former Governor himself and former head of the Academy's music branch. According to a report posted by Deadline.com's awards columnist Pete Hammond after the Oscar nominations were announced in January, Broughton \"started making phone calls to colleagues urging them to consider the song\" when filling out their Oscar ballots. \"No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one's position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one’s own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage,\" Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in the statement announcing the ouster of \"Alone Yet Not Alone.\" The inclusion of the track was a total surprise in the Best Original Song race. \"Alone Yet Not Alone\" was barely released last year, with just a seven-day Oscar qualifying run in September. (The film's actual release is scheduled for June of this year.) Despite that, \"Alone Yet Not Alone,\" which is performed by evangelical Christian author and singer Joni Eareckson Tada, wound up scoring an Oscar nod ahead of songs from Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey and Beyonce, among other major artists. In a statement that reportedly appeared on his Facebook page, Broughton commented on the Academy's decision, noting that he felt like \"the butt of a campaign to discredit a song, the nomination of which caught people by surprise.\" \"As many of you have noted, the campaigning on the other songs is epic compared to my simple email note. The marketing abilities of the other companies before and after the nomination far outstrip anything that this song was able to benefit from,\" Broughton wrote (via HitFix's In Contention blog). \"We learned this morning that the song will appear on Billboard's charts shortly. Somebody's listening to it. Somebody likes it.\" The full AMPAS press release regarding \"Alone Yet Not Alone\" is below. No song will be named as a replacement for it in the Best Original Song category, leaving \"Happy\" (from \"Despicable Me 2\"), \"Let It Go\" (from \"Frozen\"), \"The Moon Song\" (from \"Her\") and \"Ordinary Love\" (from \"Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom\") as the 2014 nominees.\n",

            "Paragraph: When student Sanmay Ved saw the google.com domain up for sale on Google’s own domain registration service last September, he thought he’d try to buy it. Of course, he never thought the sale would actually go through, but to his huge surprise it did. That’s right, in a couple of clicks, and for the princely sum of $12, Sanmay had become the proud owner of the most famous website address in the world. However, it didn’t take Google long (one minute, to be precise) to realize something had gone terribly wrong with its system, prompting it to fire off an email to Sanmay telling him it’d canceled his order and refunded his purchase. After reviewing the error, Google decided to give Sanmay a financial reward for bringing the bug to its attention. Despite people’s curiosity about how much Google paid the guy who momentarily owned its domain name, neither the Web giant nor Sanmay disclosed the sum. Until now, that is. Sanmay, who’s currently an MBA student at Babson College in Boston, said last year the company had offered him \"a $x reward in a very Googley way,\" and now we see what he means. Sort of. In a post on its security blog this week reviewing events from 2015, the Mountain View company revealed it paid Sanmay $6,006.13, the figure supposedly spelling out Google. \"Squint a little and you’ll see it,\" the company says. Of course, for a company that reported profits of $4 billion for its most recent quarter, some will wonder why Google didn’t dig a little deeper into its pockets for an error of this magnitude. However, the money was paid as part of Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program, which offers cash to those spotting bugs lurking within its multitude of systems and tools. The company said in the post that last year it paid out more than $2 million to over 300 bug hunters around the world – equal to about $6,000 per payout, the same as Sanmay received (if you squint a little). Anyway, the MBA student said from the start that holding the Google domain \"was never about money,\" and was perfectly happy with Google’s reward. In fact, he donated it to an Indian educational foundation. When Google found out, it doubled the amount.\n",

            "Paragraph: It isn’t easy being a person of faith in the world today. One of the holiest weeks of the year was marred by violence, bigotry and the deadly toll of war. For Christians, Palm Sunday kicked off the final days of Lent leading up to Easter. The Jewish holiday of Passover began Monday night, as many sat down to Seder meals to commemorate the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt. And Thursday marked Vaisakhi, which celebrates the forming of the Khalsa Panth ― the community of committed Sikhs. As millions of people gathered for prayer and celebration, a string of heinous and offensive events reminded them of life’s fragility.  The following by no means constitutes a complete list of all the lives impacted by violence and bigotry this second full week of April. But these five events bring into sharp focus the difficult task of being a person of faith in the world today. Explosions killed dozens at Coptic Christian churches in Egypt. The bombs went off at two Coptic Christian churches in Egypt, killing more than 40 people and injuring dozens of others. It was Palm Sunday, one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi declared a three-month state of emergency in response. Once again, Coptic Christians were in the news because they were being persecuted. Since the time of their split from the rest of the Christian community through the modern age, Coptic Christians have frequently been targeted with violence and aggression. It’s a sad reminder that in many parts of the world, one’s religion can be a liability. A man fatally shot his wife and a child before killing himself.  On Monday, a Southern California man walked into an elementary school classroom and shot and killed his wife, who was a special education teacher. He also shot two students, killing one and injuring the other, before reportedly killing himself.  The gunman, Cedric Anderson, was later described as a husband and father who was active in his community, according to the Los Angeles Times. He was also a devout and vocal Christian, described as a pastor by at least one person. Najee Ali, a community activist who knew Anderson, told the Times that the shooter was a \"deeply religious man.\" And yet he killed his estranged wife, Karen Elaine Smith. The shooting reminded Americans once again of the intimate horrors of domestic violence and how they play out in all too many deaths. It also highlighted a double standard that exists in public commentary on Christians and members of non-Christian faiths. In the days following the shooting, commentators did not seek to blame all of Christianity or the Bible for the abuse of women ― a tolerance rarely shown when the perpetrators of deadly crimes are Muslim.  A U.S. drone strike killed 18 members of an allied Syrian force. In ongoing efforts to wipe out the Islamic State, the U.S. mistakenly killed 18 members of allied Kurdish and Arab forces during an airstrike south of the Syrian city of Tabqa, the Pentagon said Thursday. The U.S.-led coalition forces had struck the position on Tuesday after another partner in the fight wrongly reported that the location was occupied by Islamic State militants. \"The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position,\" the Pentagon said. Those forces are attempting to encircle and ultimately capture the city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s main base of operations in Syria. The desire to advance one’s faith plays a role in this conflict, as in so many others down through the centuries in the Middle East. And people in all those wars have died needlessly and cruelly. The latest incident reminds us of what Pope Francis and many others have pointed out ― that war is madness. As the pontiff said at a military cemetery in 2014, \"War is irrational. Its only plan is to bring destruction. It seeks to grow by destroying.\" The White House’s public voice invoked the language of Holocaust denial.  On the first full day of Passover, White House press secretary Sean Spicer resurrected common tropes of Holocaust denial when he falsely claimed that Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons. During a press briefing on Tuesday, Spicer attempted to suggest that Syrian President Bashar Assad was worse than Hitler because the Nazi dictator \"didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons.\" The Nazis under Hitler’s leadership gassed millions of Jews in death camps.  Spicer later tried to walk back his remarks. \"In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust,\" he said. \"I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.\" Still later he apologized. But the irony of his comments coming on Passover was not lost on the public. Many argued that Spicer’s \"mistake\" wasn’t a one-off gaffe but rather an echo of what Vox writer Jacob Gardenswartz described as \"the Trump administration’s flirtation with Holocaust denial.\" The U.S. dropped \"the mother of all bombs\" on Afghanistan. The United States dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb for the first time in combat on Thursday, targeting Islamic State militants in Afghanistan. The strike was carried out \"as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan in 2017,\" according to a U.S. Central Command press release.  The military objective was to \"get it over and done with and get the ISIS forces killed off,\" said Barbara Starr, CNN’s Pentagon correspondent. Many Christians pointed out that the attack was carried out on Holy or Maundy Thursday by a presidential administration filled with people who brandish their Christian identity to claim the moral high ground. War again trumped faith.\n",

            "Paragraph: Find yourself sniffling over a cute puppy video? For some, crying isn't a rare occurrence. The tears can flow for seemingly no reason at all, and although people may accuse you of being too sensitive, experts say there may be an actual scientific reason why you're more tearful than your dry-eyed friends. There isn't a definitive reason as to why some of us cry more than the average person, but experts point to a range of factors including gender and whether a person may have experienced trauma in their past. Men are predisposed to avoid crying, since doing so can interfere with the way peers perceive them. And while it's true that some women are more prone to waterworks during that time of the month, other factors that may come into play include birth control pills and hormonal fluctuations that can occur around menopause. Of course it's also no surprise that if you're bogged down at work and aren't getting enough sleep, that can also play into why your tear ducts are working in overdrive. The solution? Make sure you're getting eight hours of sleep at night and try meditation or yoga to bring stress levels down. But even if you do end up weeping a little too often, don't fret. According to a Health.com article, \"past studies have found that crying can have soothing, mood-boosting effects.\" If your crying is becoming a persistent problem though, talk to your doctor as it may be a sign of depression.

            "Topic: What Happens When Millennials Grow Up?\n",
            "Paragraph: This post originally appeared on VICE UK. We share apartments with people we don't know or with our parents, live hand-to-mouth, and subscribe to a culture of anxiety. We struggle with self esteem and live our social lives online. We know what we should be because we learned it from our parents, who got married when they were our age and had kids, a mortgage, and a hatchback just a few years later. But us? We're fully grown adults living in a state of suspended childhood. So what happens in 20 years when we're all nearly middle-aged? What happens when millennials grow up? One image immediately comes to mind: a single 43-year-old burdened with mental-health issues, living in a shoebox apartment that costs $2,500 a month, scrolling obsessively through Tinder, and tweeting about the latest Palace drop to an audience of desperately lonely peers. But really, it's uncharted territory; no one really knows. Of the tens of academics, scientists, and economists I emailed, most didn't want to hypothesize—although in many ways, this unsavory tableau probably isn't too far off the mark. We're broke now, and we're likely to be living hand-to-mouth in later life, too. Ryan Bourne, head of Public Policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs, says that our generation will go into our 40s with far less accumulated wealth and be much poorer than we should be. \"This lack of wealth is partly because millennials won't own housing, but partly because they'll have always paid so much for rent that it's quite difficult to save anything to even build up to a pension, or savings and investment. That is a big problem.\" Generational expert Jason Dorsey agrees: \"We're expecting to have people in their 30s and 40s still relying heavily on their parents—30-somethings who still live at home and 40-somethings whose parents still pay for their cellphone bill. That phenomenon is putting pressure on the older generation. Unless income increases dramatically, we'll be in trouble.\" Basically, if you thought being in your 20s was high pressure, look forward to the latter end of your 30s and your early 40s. Bourne thinks we'll hit a point in our so-called middle age and realize the gravity of our situation. \"The risk there is that a lot of people in our generation will get into their 40s and panic that they really haven't got enough accumulated assets to live on in 30 years time when they retire,\" he explains. \"So you'll get a lot of people worrying in their 40s that they might not have a particularly happy retirement.\" Will we ever catch up to our parents' standards of living and accumulated wealth? According to the economists I spoke to, probably not. \"The problem is we'll still chase many of the same things that other generations want, but it's more out of reach,\" explains Dorsey. \"As our cohort enter their mid-to-late 30s, it'll be an interesting time to see if millennials achieve this idea of adulthood.\" VICE readers' number one fear is not finding love, which suggests we're not completely put off the idea of marriage, and our anger at the housing crisis shows—somewhat unsurprisingly—that we still value having a secure place to live. As we wait for these traditional markers of adulthood going into our 30s, said Dorsey and others I spoke to, we're likely to continue to be frustrated and unhappy. At this age, because we're not able to afford having children, we'll be looking to have them in our late 30s and early 40s. \"Having kids in your late 30s is more difficult and higher risk, and we believe there is going to be a lot of pressure around that time to get married and have kids,\" says Dorsey. \"It's a perfect storm. The mood will be: If you are going to do it, you have to do it now. And, for the obvious reason that it's going to be more difficult and more challenging, it's going to create a different kind of conversation. You may end up with people having less kids overall, because if they start later maybe, they can only have fewer.\" The psychological burden of that will lay with women—some of whom will find they can't have children—but it'll be felt throughout society. As Dr. Amy Kaler, professor of social structure at the University of Alberta, told VICE, if women stopped having children, \"We'd first notice the collapse of economic activity that requires young children and parents, stores for babies, nannies, day cares. Then an upward ripple in elementary schools, kids' sports. We'd also become completely dependent on immigration to continue to exist, as a country. We'd see more efforts to attract immigrants—young immigrants—to bring more people in.\" Dr. Carole Easton—chief executive of Young Women's Trust, which supports and represents women aged 16 to 30 struggling to live on low or no pay in England and Wales—is particularly concerned for the future of women. \"The reason women will struggle more, in our view,\" she says, \"is because over their lives they'll get paid less, they're more likely to be stuck in low paid and insecure jobs, and, importantly, they're more likely to be the main carers for family members.\" No one would ever be able to predict what our mental health and well-being will look like in 20 years, but it's likely that we'll remain a generation characterized by anxiety and mental health—particularly considering our openness when it comes to discussing these topics. But we should be concerned by the prevalence of mental illness in our 20s. As a general rule, the quicker mental-health issues are dealt with, the more likely you are to recover and have better or better-managed mental health in the future. \"Leaving symptoms untreated can not only result in unnecessary suffering for the individual, but interfere with building a rich and meaningful life moving forward,\" says clinical psychologist Dr. Lisa Orban. With regards to the anxiety millennials report in their 20s, she says, \"The brain is still malleable in young adulthood, and exposure to stress in one's environment early on can have an impact on the course of one's mental health. If young adults learn how to identify stress and develop adaptive coping strategies early on, chances are they will be more proficient at handling stress, which can prevent or mitigate mental-health symptoms in the future.\" But how successful have we been at developing coping mechanisms? What mental-health professionals are concerned about is that we don't know the long-term effects of living in our \"suspended adolescence.\" Lucy Lyus at mental-health charity MIND says, \"We know that everything happening to young people at the moment contributes to a lack of well-being and can lead to anxiety. Obviously it's worrying to know what is going to happen when this generation grows up.\" Lyus adds that none of these contributing lifestyle factors are going to change soon. It's in the balance: If we want to improve the future mental health of millennials, changes need to happen now. \"We know that the government will say that they are committed to making mental health as much of a priority as physical health, and have committed a billion pounds over the next five years to make that happen,\" she says. \"But we don't actually know how it's going to go.\" At least in our miserable middle age we can look forward to a long retirement, right? Not exactly. We'll work longer than any generation yet, partially because we'll be supporting the children we had late in life until much later—an issue compounded by the fact the government is hell-bent on us working right up to the brink of death. \"The state pension age is going to have to rise dramatically for us because of an aging population,\" explains Bourne. \"The government essentially introduced this triple-lock mechanism that makes the state pension even more generous, and that makes no sense when you've got an aging population. Something's got to give on that, and the most obvious thing to do would be to raise the state pension age very substantially.\" Already retirement ages are scheduled to rise to 66 in October of 2020 in the UK and, under current government proposals, 67 between 2026 and 2028, and 68 between 2044 and 2046. We don't know how much higher those could go. This all sounds very doom and gloom, but conveniently we as a generation don't exist in a bubble. We can't be ignored, and these issues—housing, lack of savings, mental health, and so on—left to fester. Eventually the knock-on effects will become a burden and our social and financial issues have to take priority. \"The contemplation of what's going to happen if we don't fix all of these problems is almost too awful to think about,\" says Rachel Laurence from the think tank New Economics Foundation. \"I think if we really don't fix most of them, there will be a major economic crash and a massive depression. But I hope that with the huge number of people moving into the second and third phases of adulthood with these situations, this is a tipping point.\" As Laurence points out, our whole economy is powered by debt. If a generation isn't able to buy mortgages on properties for them or their children, while wages stay stubbornly and unfairly low and the economy grows, it's a \"ticking time bomb\" situation. When will we leave our extended adolescence? Does dealing with all this mean we will have finally grown up by the time we're through the worst of it, if we ever even reach that stage? Dorsey predicts that we'll feel like we've reached adulthood when we're about 40—and I'm inclined to agree. But all we do know with certainty is that what \"adulthood\" means and how it is defined will completely change with our generation. Passing 18 could soon mean nothing—just an excuse for a party and the ability to buy a drink without fake ID. And many more traditional markers of adulthood could also be abandoned; \"being an adult\" might not mean owning a home or having a child any longer. Just as our parents set the parameters for our idea of what adulting was, we'll decide what being an adult means for Gen Z and beyond.\n",

Food and Drink channel has given viewers a look inside a factory where the nuggets are made, reports But it turns out we needn’t have been too worried about it, as a new video on thechannel has given viewers a look inside a factory where the nuggets are made, reports The Sun. Meat scientist (don’t ask) Amy Steward takes us through the whole process, showing the breast, rib and tenderloin meat which goes into the nuggets and explaining how the skin is removed at the start but a small portion of it is added back later for extra flavour. In the clip you can see a line of workers carving chickens before the cuts are put through a course grinder. After the skin is mixed back in, the nuggets are passed through a thin layer of batter then a thin layer of breader – containing flavourings like celery salt and white pepper. Amy then explains: The final step is the Tempura, or thicker batter, which is really unique to the nugget. It’s a blend of wheat flour, cornflour, starches and leavening agents which aerate the batter. That’s what makes the nuggets really unique. YouTube So there you have it, we may have been expecting pink slime, beak and feet but they really do seem to be made with white chicken meat. Not that it would’ve stopped me...\n",

            "Paragraph: The mystery behind China’s giant pyramid hills has intrigued archaeologists, historians and UFO conspiracy theorists ever since their existence was first documented in 1945 by a US Air Force pilot named James Gaussman. During a flight between China and India, the American pilot reported seeing a gigantic white-topped pyramid in a level valley after banking to avoid a mountain. He described it as looking like something out of a fairy tale. \"It was pure white on all sides. The remarkable thing was the capstone, a huge piece of jewel-like material that could have been crystal. There was no way we could have landed, although we wanted to. We were struck by the immensity of the thing,\" recalled Gaussman, according to Walter Hain’s article \"Pyramids in China\". In March 1947, the New York Times published an interview with Colonel Maurice Sheahan, the Far Eastern director of Trans World Airlines, who stated that he had seen a gigantic pyramid 65 kilometres southwest of Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi Province located in northwest China. A couple of days later, the same newspaper published a photo (see below), which was later attributed to Gaussman. Above: James Gaussman's 1945 photo of the 'White Pyramid'. The White Pyramid Over the years, there have been subsequent reports of almost 100 other pyramids located across the Qin Chuan Plains in Shaanxi Province and most are located within 100 kilometres of Xi’an. At first, information about these pyramids was hard to come by, since most were located inside so-called \"forbidden zones\". With the opening up of China, these areas became accessible to tourists and foreign travellers. In 1994, Hartwig Hausdorf, a German travel agent and author, wrote a book called Die Weisse Pyramide (The White Pyramid). The book contained photographs of pyramid-like mounds that proved once and for all that China indeed has pyramids. In his 2009 article, author Hain writes that from the ground these pyramidal mounds look more like hills, making it hard for people to associate them with pyramids. Hain, whose interests include the study of ancient structures, used modern technology to pinpoint the exact location of the pyramids. \"I used Google Earth to search over China. I looked at the coordinates that were mentioned in a book by [New Zealand author] Bruce Cathie. The view from the satellite showed these pyramids quite clearly.\" Above: Location of the ‘White Pyramid’ is also known as the Maoling Mausoleum 1, the final resting place of Emperor Wu Di, the fifth ruler of the Western Han Dynasty. No extra-terrestrial explanations There’s no need to look for extra-terrestrial explanations to understand the Chinese pyramids because they were built for the same reason as the Great Pyramids of Egypt: as a final resting place for rulers. Experts have confirmed that the White Pyramid is the burial mound of Emperor Wu Di (156-87 BCE), the fifth ruler of the Western Han Dynasty. The mausoleum is the biggest of five burial mounds in the city of Xianyang, which used to be known as Wulingyuan, meaning the ‘garden complex of five tombs’. During the Western Han Dynasty, the construction of a mausoleum for the emperor could begin in the second year of his reign, with a third of the annual revenue allocated to the building of this tomb. It took 53 years to be completed. According to China.org, these grave sites were \"marked by earth mounds packed into square shapes with level tops.\" Because of their square shape, they were called fangshang. The biggest pyramid is 46.5 metres high and 240 meters long at the base, while the top section measures 39.5 metres by 35.5 metres. Incidentally, ‘Maoling’ is also the name of one of the Ming Dynasty Tombs found near Beijing, so don’t confuse the two. Today the Maoling Mausoleum is a popular tourist destination that also has a museum dedicated to the Western Han Dynasty period, boasting more than 4,000 excavated treasures and cultural relics.

            "Paragraph: Britain Won't Be The First To Leave A United Europe. Guess Who Was? Enlarge this image toggle caption Leiff Josefsen/AP Leiff Josefsen/AP I was in Luxembourg recently, in advance of the British referendum on leaving the European Union, and received a tour, a history lesson and practically a sermon on the merits of the European Union by Heinz-Hermann Elting. Elting is a German-born resident of Luxembourg City. He's retired now and rides his bicycle around the city when he isn't caring for his sheep — that's singular \"sheep.\" He used to work for the European Parliament, a movable legislative feast that spends a part of the year in Luxembourg. His fervor for European integration is passionate and his knowledge of its institutions is encyclopedic. So when I observed that the United Kingdom would be the first country to leave the European Union, he corrected me. \"Great Britain is not the first case,\" he said. So who was? Greenland. Here's the story. Greenlanders didn't want to join the European Economic Community, as the EU's forerunner was called. But Greenland was part of Denmark, and the Danes outvoted them in 1973 and joined the EEC. Six years later, Greenland won autonomy from Copenhagen. Greenland then held its own referendum on European membership in 1982. More than 12,000 Greenlanders voted to leave, versus just over 11,000 who voted to remain. So Greenland began exiting the EEC, though the process wasn't instantaneous. \"I remember that we did in the Legal Affairs Committee a report on the exit conditions of Greenland,\" Elting recalled. How long did it take? \"At least two years,\" he said. Greenland officially divorced from the EEC in 1985. There are actually a couple of other cases, including French Algeria. The Mediterranean coast of Algeria was considered an integral part of France and became part of the EEC along with France in 1957. However, after Algeria received independence from France in 1962, it left the EEC. Greenland, with a current population of around 56,000, does stand out by leaving the European grouping while remaining part of a country — Denmark — that has stayed in. Greenland's leaders have said consistently that they are satisfied with the decision to leave. In a 2013 interview with the BBC, then-Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist said, \"We have regular meetings with the [European] Parliament, and the European Union is one of our international partners — an important partner, and important for trade.\" \"But,\" he added, \"at the moment, there's no serious consideration for rejoining the European Union.\" To be fair to all those who say Britain would be the first country to leave the EU, that is technically true. Greenland was not, and is not, fully independent. And the European Economic Community did not become the European Union until 1993.\n",

            "Topic: The real costs of a \"Marvel body\": How the pressure to look like Thor and Captain America is hurting men\n",
            "Paragraph: \"Bigorexia\" is on the rise—male body standards have changed drastically since superheroes looked like George Reeves Do you want a body like a Marvel superhero? Be prepared to eat—a lot. In a recent interview with BuzzFeed, Chris Hemsworth’s stunt double, Bobby Holland Hanton, told the outlet that he has to eat 35 times a day to \"anywhere near [Hemsworth’s] size.\" Henton, who claims that he also worked out twice a day to stay in superhero shape, previously told Muscle and Fitness that his high protein diet (which consisted of turkey, chicken, nuts, eggs, and spinach) was a massive impediment to having a healthy social life: \"It made me kind of unsociable in a way because you can’t go out with friends or family because you’re picking what you can and can’t in the menu. ... It was a big challenge for me.\" Hanton’s interview illustrates the extreme pressures that men face to be as fit and as big as humanly possible. Following the success of \"The Avengers,\" and most recently \"Captain America: Civil War,\" a number of workout and diet regimens promise to help men look like Thor, Hawkeye, and the Captain (in as little as six weeks!). These routines have become so widespread that as Muscle and Fitness reports, they are arguably more popular than the actors who popularized them: \"The physique he built has made ‘Chris Hemsworth Workout’ the top search suggestion when you punch the actor’s name into Google.\" There are several different Marvel-themed programs that will help men seeking maximum muscularity achieve their fitness goals, many of which are prohibitively expensive. If the USDA estimated in 2016 that the average adult male aged 19-50 spends around $69.80 every week on food, that’s based on the expectation that these men eat around three meals a day—with perhaps a snack in between. Hanton eats 10 times that amount, meaning that a fitness enthusiast hoping to keep pace with his diet would spend $698 a week to do so. That comes out to $36,000 a year. (To clarify: That's a top-end estimate it's possible Hanton is not eating full meals every time he eats.) That’s not even adding in the costs of paid programs like CrossFit, which commonly set members back around $200 each month. In addition to the cost, there are a number of dangers to the Marvel plan. The first is overexertion: As Time reported in February of last year, working out too much can actually be just as harmful for one’s health as working out too little. Researchers in Denmark found that \"people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise.\" In the case of Gerard Butler, the famously grueling workout he was subjected to for \"300\" stopped him from exercising at all after the movie wrapped he quit working out for a year. In a 2007 interview with Film Monthly, the Scottish actor claimed that he would never make the choice to put his body through that again. Extreme fitness programs can be dangerous in a variety of ways: They are bad for your body, decrease life expectancy, and are associated with a high rate of injury. As fitness instructor Erin Simmons argued in a 2014 article on CrossFit, crash exercising can be a gift to doctors because it \"means job security for medical professionals.\" Simmons spoke with a number of \"strength and conditioning coaches\" about the rise of regimes like CrossFit and \"not a single one of them\" would recommend it. She continues, \"These same athletic trainers warn every single athlete against CrossFit and tell them the health risks of being involved in it.\" With the extreme risks and financial burden associated with looking like Steve Rogers, it’s worth asking: Is this emphasis on getting big at all costs making us any happier? In 2015, a BBC report noted that \"bigorexia\" (more accurately known as \"muscle dysphoria\") is on the rise in young men. Rob Willson, who serves as the president of the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, told the BBC: \"We know about 10 percent of men in the gym may have muscle dysmorphia.\" Dr. Michele Kerulis of Adler School of Professional Psychology told The Daily Mail that rate may be even higher: She claimed as many as 45 percent of frequent male gym goers male suffer from disordered body image. That estimate seems very high, but it’s impossible to ignore the fact that male body standards have changed dramatically since Superman looked like George Reeves, rather than a human action figure. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to build muscle mass or be fit, but it’s worth remembering that there’s a reason Chris Hemsworth has the ability to look like a Norse God: He’s paid to. He has the luxury to spend absurdly long hours in the gym because it is his job. For the rest of us, attempting to live our lives by those same standards isn’t just impossible. It might be killing us.\n",

            "Topic: 11 Things You Probably Didn’t Know Were Funded With Help From The National Endowment For The Arts\n",
            "Paragraph: President Trump has proposed eliminating the NEA in his first federal budget. Here’s a sampling of famous American art created with the help of the endowment since it was founded in 1965. 1. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial In 1980, when organizers of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund were searching for a monument designer, they turned to the NEA’s Council for the Arts, which funded a national competition to find one. Completed in 1982, Maya Lin’s iconic, winning monument — a glossy, 247-foot black wall inscribed with the names of 58,307 soldiers who were killed or missing in action in the Vietnam War — is now one of the most popular memorials in Washington, DC, visited by over 3 million people each year. 2. The Sundance Film Festival Robert Redford’s Sundance Institute began as a small workshop for filmmakers and artists in 1981 with support from the NEA. It’s since gone on to produce the biggest film festival in America, which has launched the careers of Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, among numerous others. 3. Alice Walker’s first novel, The Third Life of Grange Copeland In 1970, more than a decade before she earned a Pulitzer Prize for her literary classic The Color Purple, a young Alice Walker used an NEA Discovery Award to fund work on her debut about a sharecropper in rural Georgia. 4. The American Ballet Theatre In 1965, the very first NEA grant — a check for $100,000 — went to the American Ballet Theatre, which was on the verge of insolvency at the time. Based in New York, America’s National Ballet Company performs for 450,000 people each year during its annual national tours. 5. A Prairie Home Companion In 1976, a grant from the NEA helped grow Garrison Keillor’s wry, satirical variety show about small-town life in Minnesota from a fledgling curiosity at a college auditorium, to a (still-running) nationally syndicated program beloved by millions of weekly radio listeners for decades. 6. Jeffery Eugenides’ novel Middlesex Two years after the release of his debut novel, The Virgin Suicides, in 1993, Jeffrey Eugenides received an NEA fellowship that funded work on his long-gestating, more ambitious follow-up, Middlesex. After it was released in 2002, the book was heralded as a modern American classic, receiving the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and selling more than 3 million copies, in part due to its selection by Oprah’s Book Club. 7. Hamilton Back in 2013, when it was still called by its working title, The Hamilton Mixtape, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s record-shattering, Tony Award–hoovering musical was a selection of the Powerhouse Theater Season, a New York theater workshop funded that year in part by a $30,000 NEA grant. A Powerhouse reading of Hamilton marked the first time the full musical was unveiled in public. 8. John Kennedy Toole’s novel A Confederacy of Dunces John Kennedy Toole killed himself in 1969, leaving only a manuscript of his classic American tragicomedy behind. Ten years later, novelist Walker Percy — working in tandem with Toole’s mother, Thelma — succeeded in pitching it to the Louisiana State University Press, which applied for an NEA grant to help pay for the novel’s publishing costs. In 1981, it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. 9. The American Film Institute In 1967, at the behest of President Lyndon B. Johnson, the NEA partnered with the Motion Picture Association of America and the Ford Foundation to create an archive of important works in US film history. The American Film Institute, born from that collaboration, has since preserved over 27,500 theatrical features, including films, shorts, newsreels, and documentaries. Its graduate film program in LA, the AFI conservatory, counts John Cassavetes, David Lynch, and Terrence Malik among its alumni. 10. Michael Cunningham’s first novel, A Home at the End of the World Before he wrote the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel The Hours (which was later turned into the Academy Award–winning film of the same name), Michael Cunningham completed his debut novel with the help of an NEA fellowship. In 2004, A Home at the End of the World was adapted by Cunningham into a film of the same name starring Colin Farrell and Robin Wright. 11. The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis The Walker Art Center, one of the Midwest’s premiere art museums, is visited by over 700,000 people each year. Since 1968, the museum has used NEA funding to house and nurture the work of dozens of renowned, multi-disciplinary artists, including Ralph Lemon, Merce Cunningham, and the Minnesota Opera Company.\n",

            "Paragraph: Is it just us, or is the world's least-visited country actually one of the most beautiful places to ever exist? Kiribati (pronounced kiri-bas) had just 6,000 visitors last year -- this makes it the least-visited country on Earth for which data is available from the United Nations World Tourism Organization. But Kiribati should have many, MANY more passers-by, if these photos have anything to say about it. The beaches are so sprawling, the water so blissfully clear, and the vegetation so verdantly tropical that this paradise is an ideal -- and severely underappreciated -- island escape. Kiribati is a string of 33 islands way out in the Pacific Ocean. A small nation all its own, Kiribati has quaint, tropical lodges to house the brave souls who trek here for top-notch diving, surfing, swimming and record-breaking game fishing. Japanese and American forces battled at Kiribati’s main islands during World War II, so you can visit the site of the battle, or examine eight-inch coastal defense guns and solid concrete bunkers left from World War II. Kiribati's tourism website also says that shipwrecks, and rusted crafts can be seen on the shores during low tide. Channel facing Buota Deserted beach on Christmas Island Tarawa Lagoon This place is fascinating, but perhaps its lack of visitors is due to inaccessibility: flights are scarce, though Fiji Airways has a return weekly service to Kiribati between Nadi, Fiji and Honolulu, Hawaii. Once you get to Kiribati, though, a land of relaxation, beauty and history awaits. The worst part, though, is that Kiribati is quickly disappearing. The nation recently purchased 6,000 acres of land from Fiji, presumably so Kiribati's citizens can eventually relocate before the effects of climate change overtake their precarious island nation. We're on our way, Kiribati! Aerial shot of Christmas Island\n",

            "Paragraph: Congratulations on making it through the '00s. 1. Over-plucking your eyebrows to the thickness of one hair.  If your eyebrows were more than one hair wide, you were considered profoundly unfashionable. 2. Bleaching your hair on top and dyeing it black underneath. For some reason, it was all about the contrast in the '00s. 3. Coating your eyelashes in up to six layers of mascara.  The more lashes you could get to clump together, the better. 4. Applying shimmery pastel eyeshadow to your eyelids.  So glamorous! 5. Covering your face and chest in sooooo much bronzer.  You wanted to look like you were from The O.C., but realistically, you just looked like a tangerine. 6. Getting a feathered haircut and then flipping out the bottoms of your hair with curling tongs.  It was all about the ~TeXtUrE~. 7. Using Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse. It was very important that your entire face was one colour. 8. Giving yourself chunky highlights from a Superdrug packet.  The bigger the difference between your two hair colours, the better. 9. Wearing a very thick plastic headband that did not pull any of your hair back.  They were always either black or white. 10. Side ponytails.  Wearing a side pony made you feel like a pop star. 11. Giving your hair some volume by using a Bumpit.  You got one from the queueing aisle of Poundland and used it for a week until it snapped. 12. Drawing circles on your cheeks with blusher.  It was chic to always look a little bit flushed back then. 13. Lining your entire eye (i.e., not just your top lid) with Bad Gal eyeliner.  The goal was to look like Effy from Skins. 14. Over-straightening your hair.  It probably took years of deep-conditioning treatments to get your hair back to normal. 15. Covering your chest in a body glitter bar from Lush.  This was your go-to-school disco look. 16. The pob.  Short hair of the same length was soooo drab in the '00s. 17. Concealing your entire lips.  Having lips was something to be secretive about back then. 18. Or just covering them in Juicy Tubes lip gloss.  19. Pulling two greasy strands out of your ponytail to frame your face.  So pretty. 20. Lining your lips in a much darker colour than your lipstick.  A purple lip liner and a pink lipstick was considered a very good combination. 21. And, of course, side fringes in general.  If it looked like you only had one eye, you were doing it right.\n",

According to dermatologist, Dr. Carl Thornfeldt, mint has a calming affect on inflamed skin and can also treat some skin infections. According to Dr. Thornfeldt, it has now been proven that spearmint is the most potent of the different mints when it comes to killing bacteria and yeasts.

            "Paragraph: Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo (9) throws during an afternoon practice at training camp in Oxnard, Calif., on Friday, Aug. 5, 2016. (Max Faulkner/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images) Everyone used to know who America's Team was. These days, it's not as obvious. The Dallas Cowboys will never fully lose the lofty \"America's Team\" nickname, but the title has certainly not been earned in recent years. The Cowboys might make a load of money -- the franchise is the most valuable in the world, according to Forbes -- but that's where the relevance stops. Business is only half the game, at best, and in the modern media landscape, the product on the field matters more and more every year. Look at a franchise like the Golden State Warriors. Before Stephen Curry became the back-to-back MVP of the NBA, the Warriors were arguably the worst franchise in all of sports. The Chicago Blackhawks couldn't put 3,000 people in the United Center before 2008 -- now the Hawks are a cash cow that might as well have a national TV deal. Relevance comes cheap these days. Staying power is hard to maintain. Amid these truths, the Cowboys are testing fate -- they're a worse-than .500 team in recent years that is cashing in on its reputation from 20 years ago. Since 2010, the Cowboys have been 46-50, with three-straight 8-8 years from 2011 to 2014. The Cowboys haven't been to the NFC Championship Game since 1995, the season they last won the Super Bowl. The Redskins and Lions can boast longer NFC title game droughts, but that isn't saying much -- think about how many times the Bears have gone from bad to good and back in that 20-year stretch. The Cowboys have given those under the age of 25 nothing worthwhile to remember them from, outside of three above-average regular seasons, and it shows. The Cowboys are reportedly concerned about the team's lack of success and how the brand -- the most valuable brand in the NFL -- doesn't resonate with the new generation of fans. They should be concerned. The Cowboys might be the most popular team in the NFL, according to the most recent numbers from Harris , but the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers are the favorite teams of those under the age of 30. The Cowboys make up the big meaty middle -- they're the dominant team of those aged 30-64 -- but that group doesn't determine who is cool these days. Ninety-four percent of respondents under the age of 30 told Public Policy Polling before the Super Bowl that the Cowboys were not \"America's Team.\" PPP also found that no survey takers from ages 18-29 listed the Cowboys as their favorite team, but 41 percent of those under-30s did say the Cowboys were their least favorite team. In all, the Cowboys were the second least-liked team in the NFL, despite the fact that they haven't posed much of a threat to anyone for the last 15-or-so years. High disapproval and an aging and diminishing support base -- it doesn't take a political scientist to figure out that if the Cowboys don't change paths soon, they're going to see a precipitous fall. (Donald Trump, who shares these polling qualities, probably thinks the Cowboys shouldn't change a thing.) So who is America's Team these days? Well, polling shows that if you're winning, you're the favorite. How else would the Carolina Panthers be the favorite team of under-30s? Given the flippant nature of fandom, the correct answer might be \"none of the above.\" The social media age, the constant expansion of fantasy football, the RedZone channel, and ability to watch any game you want on any device you can imagine might make the unaffiliated the most influential NFL fans. Fans might say they like the local team, but it's not hard to imagine a scenario where they care as much about their fantasy team as what the Titans are doing. Alas, even if they win big this year, it might be too late for the Cowboys to earn back the \"America's Team\" title.\n",

            "Paragraph: Lucas Film For all the lightsabers, X-Wings and Wookies, Star Wars has always been, at its heart, the ongoing story of the galaxy’s most dysfunctional family. Now, if one recently revealed fan theory turns out to be true, you can expect the familial drama to get even messier in Episode VIII. According to Reddit user Beeslo, there’s a chance that scavenger turned (possible) Jedi, Rey, and the best pilot in the resistance, Poe Dameron, could be siblings. While finding false connections between characters is pretty common place in Star Wars fandom (remember when we were all convinced Emperor Snoke was actually Jar Jar Binks?), Beeslo actually has some not-totally-crazy evidence to back up their claim. In the Star Wars universe comic Shattered Empire — a story that bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens — we’re introduced to Force Trees. These are trees that, as you can probably guess, are imbued with the living force. At the end of the four-part series, Luke Skywalker bestows a Force Tree on to a trusted friend, a pilot named Shara Bey. Shara plants the tree outside of her house, which she shares with her young son, Poe Dameron. That certainly helps explain what makes Poe such an insanely talented pilot — he was absorbing the Force every time he went to play in his family’s backyard! Lucas Film From here Beeslo begins to theorize that maybe Poe wasn’t an only child, maybe his parents gave him a little sister. And if just hanging out around a Force Tree can give you Force powers, imagine how powerful a kid conceived near one would be. Honestly, this makes us feel a little bad for Poe. It’s never easy when your younger sibling turns out to be better than you at everything. Imagine how he’ll feel when he discovers his little sister, Rey, is an advanced level Force user while he’s never even wielded a lightsaber before. Obviously the theory isn’t one hundred percent sound. For one thing, Rey and Poe don’t share any screen time in The Force Awakens. It’s hard to imagine that the filmmakers wouldn’t even hint at such a gigantic relationship. Then again, there were no real hints in A New Hope that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader shared any kind of lineage. Maybe we’re just being kept in the dark for an Empire-sized reveal. No matter what, if this all turns out to be true, it’s bound to make the relationships in Episode VIII just as complicated as we’ve come to expect from the Star Wars saga.\n",

Authorities — and TV news helicopters — were tracking a man in a car stolen in Lakewood. The man drove recklessly for nearly an hour, hitting an armored car and another vehicle. At one point, he looked up and waved at TV choppers broadcasting the chase. He ended up in the hills above Whittier, along Turnbull Canyon Road. See the most-read stories this hour >> There, he slowed his vehicle in a tree-covered section of the road. As the Honda Accord kept moving, he climbed almost imperceptibly out of the driver’s window. The vehicle coasted to a stop farther down the road. It appeared the man might have gotten away. But minutes later, the man, who was wearing a Tony Romo Dallas Cowboys football jersey, was taken into custody, his mad scramble for freedom stopped short.

            "Paragraph: Rates of marijuana use among Colorado's teenagers are essentially unchanged in the years since the state's voters legalized marijuana in 2012, new survey data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment shows. In 2015, 21 percent of Colorado youths had used marijuana in the past 30 days. That rate is slightly lower than the national average and down slightly from the 25 percent who used marijuana in 2009, before legalization. The survey was based on a random sample of 17,000 middle and high school students in Colorado. \"The survey shows marijuana use has not increased since legalization, with four of five high school students continuing to say they don’t use marijuana, even occasionally,\" the Colorado health department said in a news release. The numbers out of Colorado are being closely monitored by policymakers and advocates on both sides of the marijuana legalization divide. Researchers generally agree that marijuana use during adolescence should be strongly discouraged — younger users are more likely to become dependent on the drug, and teens who use marijuana heavily are at higher risk of a number of mental and physical health problems later in life. Opponents have often claimed that marijuana legalization would lead to more kids smoking pot, with all the negative health consequences that would entail. But the scant data available until now hasn't borne this out. Voters in Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia voted to legalize marijuana in the 2014 midterm elections. They joined Colorado and Washington, which did so in 2012. So could other states follow suit in 2016? The Washington Post's Niraj Chokshi breaks down the possibilities. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) National surveys have shown that teen marijuana use rates are falling across the country. But there haven't been many numbers available specifically for states such as Colorado and Washington where it is legal. Federal data released late last year showed that teen use rates in Colorado and Washington were essentially flat, but they covered only 2014, the first year commercial marijuana was available in those states. The latest data from Colorado includes 2015, reflecting two full years of the legal marijuana market's effect. These numbers give the strongest indication yet that fears of skyrocketing adolescent use have not materialized. \"These statistics clearly debunk the theory that making marijuana legal for adults will result in more teen use,\" Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. \"Levels of teen use in Colorado have not increased since it ended marijuana prohibition, and they are lower than the national average. Elected officials and voters in states that are considering similar proposals should be wary of claims that it will hurt teens.\" Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group opposing legalization, has pointed out that the most recent federal surveys show that teen marijuana use rates in Colorado are among the highest in the country. But this latest survey, conducted by the state of Colorado, shows that teen use rates in that state are about average.

For starters, this latest survey polled a much larger sample of Colorado students, 17,000, than the federal survey, which polls fewer than 400 Colorado teenagers in a given year. That much larger sample could produce a more accurate estimate than the smaller numbers in the federal drug survey. There's a simple reason why legalization may not be having much of an effect on teen marijuana use — adolescents already report that marijuana is widely available. Nationally, roughly 80 percent of 12th-graders say that pot is easy to get. The kids who want to smoke weed are probably already doing so — and legalization would do little to change that.\n",

            "Paragraph: Gun-controlled Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 800 homicides throughout the year. The Chicago Tribune reports that there were a total of 779 homicides between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. That is an increase of 287 homicides over 2015 totals. There were 4,385 shootings — fatal and non-fatal combined — in gun-controlled Chicago during 2016. That is an increase of nearly 1,500 shootings over the 2,900 Time magazine reported for 2015. 2016 was marred by shooting after shooting in Chicago. In fact, by early September, the egregious violence in the city was so high that ABC News reported \"nearly 12\" people had been shot every day in the city from January 1 to the end of August. Chicago has been a testing ground for gun control for decades. The city put a ban on handgun ownership in place in 1982 and the Tribune reported that the next 10 years witnessed a \"41 percent\" jump in murders, \"compared with an 18 percent rise in the entire United States.\" And why shouldn’t such a ban lead to an increase in murder? After all, when bans are enacted, only the criminals remain armed. The ban was overturned in 2010 via the Supreme Court ruling in McDonald v Chicago, but city leaders have worked diligently to preserve the vestiges of the ban at every turn in the road. Municipal and county limits on the number of gun stores allowed in Chicago, together with rules on the locations of those stores and a ridiculous amount of regulation on acquiring and carrying guns for self-defense, have coalesced to guarantee that criminals maintain an advantage similar to what they enjoyed when the ban was in place. The result of Chicago gun control is self-evident — bloody and repulsive, but self-evident none the less.\n",

            "Paragraph: The promo art for the fourth season of \"Portlandia\" is out and, spoiler alert, it's perfect. Comedy duo par excellence Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein recruited photographer Alex Prager for the job, riffing off her most recent series \"A Face In The Crowd.\" Prager's sharp-edged, cinematic shots capture the hustle and bustle of an anonymous crowd, emphasizing the bizarre juxtaposition of physical proximity and mental distance. In the \"Portlandia\" photos, Prager replaces her signature medley of ambiguously retro costumes with an assortment of Portland-esque stereotypes, ripe with vintage prints, handlebar mustaches and a heavy dose of plaid. Prager's images, stylized to the brink of surrealism, perfectly compliment Armisen and Brownstein's affirmative and absurd brand of humor. We reached out to Armisen to discuss Prager's work and ended up discovering his goal is to be Cindy Sherman. Needless to say, our minds were blown. Read on. Were you familiar with Alex's work before the shoot? A little bit, but Carrie was more familiar with it. And I'm glad, because nothing is more rewarding than finding out about a new artist. It is such a nice thing, such a nice part about life, getting to know an artist. Although, that being said, when I first saw her work I had the feeling I had seen it before. Yeah there is a strange familiarity to them. Well, yes, but I think I had seen them before. Oh, you literally had seen them! [Laughs] What led you to choose her work in particular for the \"Portlandia\" images? For this season we wanted to do something different than what we'd done with previous seasons. The idea of involving an artist, a person who really does make art, really appealed to us. All of the ads we've done before have just been Carrie and I. This time we wanted to involve more people. The show is very much a group, even thought it's just a few of us, really it's about a city. It's a little world, which is just what Alex creates in her work. I think Carrie brought Alex up and we thought she was perfect. The costumes are hilarious. Whose idea was that? That was all her. This is very much her piece. She has a cast that she uses, and these wigs and costumes that are very much her. When we were talking to her she said she liked wigs to look like wigs, which I think is brilliant. I am so used to making wigs and things look as real as possible, when I heard that I was blown away. \"This Is An Art Project\" is one my favorite Portlandia sketches of all time. Can we look forward to more art-centric bits in the new season? Yes there are! The idea of art is definitely addressed. We try to address art and music as much as we can, so there is definitely an art piece coming up. Can you tell me a little about it? No! The only reason is there is no way that me describing it will be able to do it justice. I also recently saw you perform at MOCA. Are you trying to involve yourself more in the art world? I'm just in love with that world. I love everything about it. I went to art school. Right before I started SNL I always wanted to be Cindy Sherman. When I first started hearing about her and seeing her pictures I was like she is doing the best thing ever. Alex Prager and Cindy Sherman have a lot in common as well. I totally agree. Maybe 100 years in the future we can see that as a type of aesthetic. Alex Prager, Cindy Sherman, and also people you and I don't know. That's such a great way to think about all the characters you play. I'll just say that Cindy Sherman is what I aspire to be. \"Portlandia\" returns to IFC on Thursday, February 27, 2014. Enjoy some of Ms. Sherman's work in the slideshow below and let us know if you see the many faces of Fred Armisen as a similar artistic pursuit. (We certainly do!)\n",

            "Paragraph: The dog in this video may love the song even more than her owners do. Loving music and wanting to shake your groove thing is not something that is only specific to humans. This cute pup is definitely enjoying the smash hit collaboration between Flo Rida and T-Pain and nothing will stop her from dancing up a storm. The German shepherd has the music in her soul and she plans on letting everyone know just how much she loves this particular song by choosing a peculiar body part to dance with: her wars. The wiggling and jiggling of her ears definitely shows us one important thing, her ability to express her inner musicality, no matter what the obstacles may be. We could all stand to learn a thing or two from this adorable dog. She is enjoying herself and is not all that concerned with what those around her may think of her hi-jinx. In a world where people seem to live for the perception of others and are in perpetual fear that they will make fools of themselves, the actions of this German shepherd should serve as an inspiration. You can already hear the naysayers if you’re quiet enough. Dogs don’t understand music, dogs can’t dance, dogs are too stupid to feel genuine emotions. The owner of this funky pup decided to show the world just how wrong they were by catching his pet in the middle of an impromptu jam session. The good time that this German shepherd is enjoying while rocking out to Flo Rida is infectious. Life is too short not to live it to the fullest. Spread this hilarious and heart warming around and share the love with your closest friends and family.\n",

            "Paragraph: The U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime released its 2013 Global Study on Homicide this week. Overall, the number of murders in the world is relatively stable—even declining slightly—but the most striking finding in the report is how geographically concentrated homicide is become. Joshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs. According to the report, a group of countries—all of them in either the Americas or Africa—accounting for just 11 percent of the global population are the location of 46 percent of the world’s homicides. Honduras has the world’s highest homicide rate at 90.4 murders per 100,000 people, and it’s not even close. Venezuela is next with 53.7. Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Jamaica all have rates around 40. The Americas overtook Africa as the region with the world’s most murders in this year’s report, accounting for 40 percent of the world’s homicides, though that's a somewhat misleading figure as there are wide geographical variations among and within countries in the region. The rates were driven largely by gang and drug violence. The Americas were also the only region where shooting accounted for the majority of homicides. The world’s safest country, in terms of homicide, is tiny Liechtenstein, which didn’t have any murders in 2012, but there are a number of countries, especially in Europe and East Asia, with rates lower than 1 per 100,000. Homicides are concentrated by gender as well. Men accounted for 95 percent of the perpetrators and 79 percent of the victims of homicide in 2012, a rate that is \"consistent across countries and regions, irrespective of the homicide typology or weapon used.\" Overall, one in seven homicide victims in 2012 were men between the ages of 15 and 29 living in the Americas.\n",

            "Paragraph: Even before being tapped as director of the new \"Blair Witch\" sequel, Adam Wingard had already earned respect as one of the top helmers in the horror genre with films like the \"V/H/S\" series and \"You’re Next.\" With \"Blair Witch,\" Wingard has taken on his first franchise after years of delivering original material, with hopes that fans of the 1999 box office sensation, as well as brand-new filmgoers, show up to theaters. Prior to its opening, Wingard spoke with Variety about the film, including how the filmmakers were able to keep the project secret for so long. Caution: There may be minor spoilers ahead. After several original projects, why did you want to make \"Blair Witch\" your first branded property? (Screenwriter) Simon (Barrett) and I had been talking for a couple of years, after doing \"You’re Next,\" \"The Guest,\" and even \"A Hard Way to Die,\" and felt that we needed to make a more straightforward horror film. We’re known for being horror filmmakers but we’ve never really committed to making a full-on horror movie — most of them are meta deconstructions or half-comedies, things that have horror elements or stylizations like \"The Guest.\" We felt that we were due to do one and wanted to prove  we could do a straightforward horror movie, but we didn’t have a firm idea of what that was. Flash forward to 2013 and we’re about to go off and do \"The Guest.\" Lionsgate is about to release \"You’re Next,\" and we happened to be in Sundance and ran into (original \"The Blair Witch Project\" director) Eduardo Sanchez and (producer) Greg Hale. We happened to ask Eduardo about how the found footage thing went through a whole cycle and he felt it was time for \"Blair Witch\" to make its comeback as a sequel, reboot, remake, or something along those lines. It was weirdly in the air enough and we sensed something. Two weeks later, Lionsgate called Simon and me in for this secret meeting and wouldn’t tell us what it was for. Once we showed up, they told us they had the rights to \"The Blair Witch\" and were interested in making a sequel with us. They had not gone out to any other filmmakers and we were the guys they were interested in, specifically because of our jump-scare driven segment in \"V/H/S 2.\" Instantly the nostalgia of the original film flooded back and all the mythology came to me immediately about Ruston Parks, things I haven’t thought about in years but I was immediately talking about it and the ideas I had for it, and I just wanted to make it a slightly bigger version of \"The Blair Witch Project,\" where the scale was a little bit bigger. It was one of those things where it was the right place at the right time — we didn’t know exactly what we wanted to do, but we knew we wanted to do something, and that ended up being \"Blair Witch.\" What did you want to add more of that wasn’t in the original and conversely, what did you want to keep intact from the first film? The main thing we wanted to keep from the original is its commitment to authenticity. The first film is a sort of sparse character study of people getting lost in the woods and there just happens to be some supernatural occurrences that get stronger as the film goes on. For me, I wanted to take that world that they had built and I wanted to take the audience on this roller coaster version of it because that’s how I felt when I saw it the first time. I’m drawing back on that nostalgia from watching it in high school and thinking what would I want to see out of this sequel that I never got. That’s a really pure thing to build a drama from as a filmmaker, that teenage thought process. You’re never going to get full ideas from it but the emotionality is almost always correct and that’s the audience you’re going for. Since it is a found footage movie, cameras are an essential part of the storytelling since you are showing the audience the cameras. How did you decide what kind of cameras to use? When we were gearing up in pre-production, we did a ton of tests. We tried the real Bluetooth cameras the characters wore, but unfortunately we couldn’t shoot with those, because they would look like basically a Sega CD. We knew this was the right idea, that kind of discreet approach to cameras. It took a lot of extensive testing because it was really important to me that we didn’t actually light the movie like a movie. I wanted the nighttime footage to be pure dark and that means flashlights would be a key component to the look and feel of the movie, which is a lot harder than it sounds, honestly. The flashlights that you want to use that put out the right kind of light are LED light, which means that a lot of them have a weird flicker thing on the camera’s shutter and they end up producing this pulsing pattern that’s really annoying. So what we ended up doing was buying a ton of flashlights and a ton of different cameras and we were rigorously doing all these tests to see which ones hold up the best. For the earpiece camera, there wasn’t just one camera we used for the film, we had one that worked for nighttime — the Sony a7S which was basically the hero camera, and for daytime we had this totally bizarre camera that was a little lower res because we knew when it was daytime we didn’t want as much sharp detail. We wanted to have a more grainier and shittier look especially on sunny days so it doesn’t look too clean. The cameras you see on screen aren’t necessarily the ones we are filming with. I hate it when you are watching a movie where the characters are on the news and for some reason they shoot it with a 35mm camera or a 4K camera and they just put it on the TV as if that’s the way it would look — it always takes me out of it by putting a filter on certain things. If it’s too high quality, you’re never gonna buy it. Are there a lot of CGI effects? I love going on IMDb message boards and there are some hilarious things that go on there — the most negative people on the planet. I remember seeing one person’s thread complaining about when you see the witch in the film that it was the worst CGI ever created and I just go, \"buddy everything you see in this film is real, there is no CGI in the movie.\" The only time any kind of post effects were utilized were mainly just straightforward pan outs and a couple displays that the cameras were looking at that we had to add and that was still more takeaway then adding anything. The glitches were enhanced in post as well, but anything you see on screen is real, the gore, anything in the woods... That thing she pulls out of her leg? That’s really a prosthetic built over the actor’s leg and that’s her really pulling something out of it. For the most part, it’s all old-fashioned tricks just done in a new way or new perspective because of found footage. The witch is never shown in the original — how decide whether to show her and how you wanted her to look? The main thing that was important to me was that we couldn’t do what the original film did and have another movie where you don’t see any evidence at all of the supernatural stuff, so we knew we had to show something in this film. I knew that everyone would have an interpretation of the witch or the thing that’s out in the woods and I didn’t want to ruin that. So we tried to design a sort of Lovecraft-style thing that would hopefully hold up under scrutiny even if you are freezing the frame whenever the film is released on video and stuff. Everyone these days is on Tumblr and you know they are making GIFs of movies and making these still-frame collections of films, so I knew someone would create a still frame thing of every shot of the witch in the film or whatever people think that is, so I wanted that to hold up. Did you expect to be able to keep the film secret all the way up until the Comic-Con presentation? I was completely blown away that we kept it a surprise. Simon and I were signed on to this thing since February 2013, so it’s been like three years that we have kept this thing under our hat. We haven’t even been able to say the words \"Blair Witch\" out loud in fear of someone picking up on it and we’re constantly looking over our shoulder at restaurants. The main thing we did to keep it secret was to never acknowledge it in any kind of way. We had it on lockdown, even at Lionsgate, about what movie we were making, but eventually some rumors leaked online. Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting somehow caught wind of it and of course since we have a relationship with Brad from the \"V/H/S\" films, it looked like we leaked it, but we didn’t. So he ended up putting this article out while we were filming, saying \"The Woods\" is \"Blair Witch\" and everyone should be excited, but the funny part is that the reaction was hilarious because everyone in the commenting section was like \"Shut the hell up, Brad.\" I think there were like 50 messages saying he was wrong and no one picked it up, and we also never acknowledged it. And by not acknowledging any of the rumors it ended up going away. Even now it seems that it’s an obvious choice to make this film but, say, a year ago, it would have seemed completely insane, because nobody was thinking this was going to happen anytime soon. So, long story short, the secret to keeping the secret was just not ever acknowledging that there was a even a secret.\n",

            "Paragraph: Several years ago I listened to an interview with Desmond Child, a massively successful songwriter you might not have heard of but whose music you've definitely heard. Desmond is gay and has been openly gay for a long time. He was describing working with Aerosmith on their hit \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady),\" and something really caught my attention (WARNING: this interview contains an offensive slur for transgender people): Desmond: ...Because of my success with Bon Jovi, John Kalodner -- the famous John Kalodner, legendary A&R man -- asked me if I would go up to Boston and meet Aerosmith. They had never written with an outside writer, and they were not happy to see me. They were going along with it to please John Kalodner, but they were not that happy about it. Steven (Tyler) was much more friendly, as he is, and was very generous, really, and showed me a song that they had started called \"Cruisin' for the Ladies.\" I listened to that lyric, and I said, \"You know what, that's a very boring title.\" And they looked at me like, \"How dare you?\" And then Steven volunteered, sheepishly, and said that when he first wrote the melody he was singing \"Dude Looks like a Lady.\" It was kind of a tongue twister that sounded more like scatting. He got the idea because they had gone to a bar and had seen a girl at the end of the bar with ginormous blonde rock hair, and the girl turned around and it ended up being Vince Neil from Motley Crue. So then they started making fun of him and started saying, \"That dude looks like a lady, dude looks like a lady, dude looks like a lady.\" So that's how that was born. That's the true story of how that was born. So I grabbed onto that and I said, \"No, that's the title of the song.\" And they looked at me like, \"Are you kidding me?\" And then Joe (Perry) stepped in and said, \"I don't want to insult the gay community.\" I said, \"Okay, I'm gay, and I'm not insulted. Let's write this song.\" So I talked them into the whole scenario of a guy that walks into a strip joint and falls in love with the stripper on stage, goes backstage and finds out it's a guy. But besides that, he's gonna go with it. He says, \"My funky lady, I like it, like it, like it like that.\" And so he doesn't run out of there, he stays. It's funny, because they used that song in Mrs. Doubtfire, and then it was like every four or five year old child in America was able to sing that song. It was like; do you realize this is about a tranny? (Laughing). If you think about how far back that was, it was a very daring song to sing, and everyone went with it. It's not like the polarized society we have now, because that was before gay people really started fighting for their rights and nobody cared about it and everyone thought that they could make fun of us. So they accepted the lyric, and not only that, went for it. (Laughs) I don't know if anyone has looked deep enough into the song, but it's a very accepting song, and it has a moral that says never judge a book by its cover, or who you're going to love by your lover. Songfacts: Have you ever talked to Vince Neil about this song? Desmond: Oh yeah, I told him the story. He had a good laugh. He knows that. He knows that he's the one that was paid homage to in \"Dude Looks Like a Lady.\" The interview took place in 2011. The song was recorded in 1987. So Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Kiss, etc., were all working with an openly gay songwriter in the mid '80s. It really stuck with me that the band was concerned about not offending their gay audience. Or that they were aware of their gay audience. Or that they had a gay audience. Now, Child uses the term \"tranny\" in the interview, and I remember hearing that and thinking, \"Man, did you have to go there?\" I wouldn't say it destroys the interview, but it definitely makes me think less of him, because the story was funny without the slur. It wasn't necessary to establish any part of the story or his credibility. It was gratuitous, and I feel that it's important to point that out in this context, because it actually proves the point about Fox News that taking potshots at transgender folks is mean and demeaning and certainly undermines one's credibility. Fast-forward to Fox News' recent decision to use Aerosmith's song to denigrate Pfc. Chelsea Manning. As with most attempts to do this, the media got the song completely wrong: The song is not mocking a man for looking like a lady; it's describing the sex appeal of a transgender woman. It's the same old story: They've similarly misused songs by Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Tim McGraw, Maroon 5 and so forth. They don't listen to the lyrics. They don't think. They fall for a good hook, but instead of getting drawn into the music, their minds stop there. The members of Aerosmith were not out and avowed allies of the LGBTQ community in the 1980s. They were a rock group with a song co-written by an openly gay man and didn't want to offend anyone. In his 2011 memoir Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler described a sexual encounter he'd had with a man, writing, \"Gay sex just doesn't do it for me. I tried it one time when I was younger, but I just didn't dig it.\" That's pretty straightforward. In the same book he went on to write that he preferred his female groupies to be freshly showered after a show. Sigh. Well, that's another post. \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\" was not some great homage to the LGBTQ community, but it was something. It was risky, and the back story is interesting, and it proves (to me, at least) that conservative pundits at Fox News and other outlets underestimate the art of most modern musicians and misunderstand their values. That's something. Sadly, Aerosmith can't stop Fox News from abusing their song, but they can speak out, like Adam Levine did, and I hope that they do. Aerosmith isn't perfect, but Fox News got this whole song wrong. Just consider the lyrics: Never judge a book by its cover, Or who you gonna love by your lover. Sayin' \"love\" put me wise to her love in disguise: She had the body of a Venus; Lord, imagine my surprise! That, that dude looks like a lady! That, that dude looks like a lady! That, that dude looks like a lady! That, that dude looks like a lady! Baby, let me follow you down. (Let me take a peek, dear.) Baby, let me follow you down. (Do me, do me, do me all night.) Baby, let me follow you down. (Turn the other cheek, dear.) Baby, let me follow you down. (Do me, do me, do me, do me!) Ooh, what a funky lady! Ooh, she like it, like it, like it like that! Ooh, he was a lady! Two lessons to be learned: 1) Listen to the entire song and decide for yourself what it means (don't let Fox News decide for you!); and 2) we need more artists to \"reclaim\" their music by speaking out when it's abused, even when they don't have legal standing to stop it from being abused. It still matters that they distance themselves from any misunderstandings. As a caveat, perhaps Fox News and the tea party should stick with the musical repertoires of Ted Nugent, Kid Rock and Meat Loaf. Why not give some love to those who stand by you, right?\n",

            "Topic: The real reason people write so much about Mad Men: you keep clicking\n",
            "Paragraph: One of the most consistent criticisms of Mad Men from those who aren't Mad Men fans is that — sniffs derisively — it's only beloved by the coastal media elite, because it's about rich white people who live glamorous lives and work in advertising. That strain of criticism became all the more pronounced in the buildup to the AMC drama's series finale, with Vulture launching the latest broadside against the show's popularity as author Michael Idov argued that it wasn't truly popular, just overhyped. (To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.) To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run. Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five. 1) Readers wanted to read about it In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content — far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle. Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing. 2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left When Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited. Mad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general Thus, there was a huge opening in the \"reading about TV on the internet\" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters. But Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come — and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them. 3) There just wasn't as much good TV on When Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day. But, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between — especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey's Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the \"serious TV\" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren't a ton of other options. Mad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development — and now they pretty much all do Contrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday — but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development — and now they pretty much all do. 4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done Though it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites — especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller. 5) Never underestimate passion As my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show. Early on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice The media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it. I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire. But the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us.\n",

            "Paragraph: Everything you need to know to put a ring on it. 1. Understand what EXACTLY it is that you’re looking for in a diamond. Remember the four C’s (carat, clarity, color, and cut). 2. Know what different size carats would look like on your finger. Carats refer to how much the diamond weighs. Looking for a ring with a more delicate feel? Consider a smaller diamond (like a .40 carat). 3. The’s a big difference between a 1 carat and a 2 carat diamond. If the difference between the two feels too great, you might want to consider something in between. 4. Get a handle on diamond and gemstone cuts. Maybe you’ve always pictured a radiant diamond, but have you thought about asscher? 5. If you’re considering a diamond, think about if you want it cut for *sparkle* or ~color~. Round brilliant and old European cuts both have either 57 or 58 facets, but the placement of those facets gives each cut a unique look, according to jewelry brand Erstwhile. While vintage diamonds were cut for color, modern round brilliant diamonds are cut for sparkle. 6. Here’s a closer look at the difference between the two: A brilliant diamond or gemstone is cut to have numerous facets on the top and bottom of the stone, which makes it reflect and refract a lot of light. A great way to think of a brilliant diamond: \"If you were to draw a diamond on a piece of paper, it has that pointy bottom,\" Rachel Thames, buyer and manager of Brooklyn-based jewelry store Catbird, told BuzzFeed. 7. If you want a big stone (without the $$$), look at rose cuts. You know how we said that brilliant cut diamonds have that pointy bottom? Well, a rose cut has a flat bottom, which means that the stone can have a large appearance while still weighing considerably less. \"Prices tend to go down on a rose cut stone since you’re getting less carat weight,\" jewelry designer Anna Sheffield told BuzzFeed. 8. See how rose cuts compare to brilliant and old European cuts: Rose cuts are slightly transparent, which can lead to a really delicate look. \"Rose cuts catch the light beautifully, but in a more pretty and subtle way,\" Thames said. 9. If you want something a little more *unique*, check out salt and pepper — also known as grey or included — diamonds. \"In the diamond industry, they’re not considered very practical so they tend to be a little less expensive,\" Sheffield said. But they’re shimmery, textural, naturally occurring, and magical AF. 10. If you want the grey diamond look for less, go for rutilated quartz. The rutilated quartz stone (pictured above) has black turmaline crystals inside of it, which gives it that mock grey diamond feel. Since quartz is a semi-precious stone, it will cost considerably less than a diamond. Black diamonds also tend to be less expensive than white diamonds as they are *imperfect*. 11. If you were hoping for a pink diamond, take a look at morganite. \"Pink diamonds are extremely expensive because they’re really rare, so morganite is a great way to get that clear pink look,\" Sheffield said. Morganite is a member of the beryl family (which includes emeralds), and it tends to be very *sparkly*. To play up the color, try setting it in a rose gold band. 12. If you’re not into diamonds, check out diamond alternatives. \"You want to be careful with pearl and opal engagement rings,\" Thames said. \"They’re not built to wear everyday, so if you’re out hiking you may want to take it off and wear a gold band that day.\" 13. Know how to pick a damn perfect gemstone. \"For precious stones — like emeralds, sapphires, and rubies — there’s a grading system where the more clarity and saturation it has, the nicer it is,\" Sheffield said. Learn about the gemstone grading system here. 14. If you want an impressive AF-looking ring without the high price tag, get a halo. A halo is a cluster of tiny diamonds encircling the center stone. \"What you save in the center stone you can make up in for in other ways like having a halo,\" Sheffield said. Exhibit A: the roughly 1 carat stone above (with a halo) that looks just as big as the much pricier 2 carat stone. Also, if you have a rose cut stone that isn’t as shiny, a halo is a great way to add some extra shimmer. 15. Compare different types of gold to get the perfect color. \"The number before the ‘k’ refers to the actual percentage of gold in the band,\" Thames said. \"The higher the karat, the more yellow intensity, the softer the metal is.\" If you’re going for a higher karat gold, consider a thicker band. 16.

In fact, even the director of the film franchise wants the cobalt blue, shape-shifting character to have her own movie. However, getting all that body paint done isn’t exactly a party, and medical experts are actually concerned with the body paint’s health effects. Why? Because it’s jam-packed with chemicals. \"The fact is any body paint can cause an allergic reaction if an actor’s immune system has become ‘sensitive’ to a particular ingredient,\" Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi, assistant clinical professor of department of dermatology at the George Washington University Medical Center and founder of Capital Laser and Skin Care, told Hollywood Reporter. \"The longer the exposure, the higher the risk of sensitization to the ingredients in the body paint. However, an allergy can develop even as soon as it’s applied.\" 20th Century Fox / giphy.com To give you an idea of just how involved J.Law’s body paint really is, she had to stand still for seven hours of application every single time they were shooting a scene.

            "Paragraph: The great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once famously stated, \"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.\" The sentiment of the statement is nice and one may draw inspiration from it, but it's not entirely accurate. Take for instance, air pollutants. They may not kill you, but they certainly are not making you stronger. According to Sustainable Baby Steps , the three most common toxins found within the air of your home are benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene. These toxins are usually emitted from products in the home that were manufactured in a factory. But fear not, there is a way to combat these chemicals. How so? Houseplants. For instance, according to a study done by NASA , Gerbera daisies were said to have removed high amounts of both benzene and trichloroethylene. The bamboo palm can remove formaldehyde. Pot mum not only removes benzene, but it can also improve air quality. Most of us know aloe vera is helpful in soothing sunburns, but did you know it can also help remove formaldehyde from the air? Sustainable Baby Steps says that baby rubber plants are known to remove toxins from the air. In addition, these plants also produce a high amount of oxygen. Likewise, the Chinese evergreen also emits a substantial amount of oxygen. It's known to remove harmful chemicals from the air as well. You ought to stick a peace lily in your bathroom because they're known to remove mold spores from the air. In addition to that, peace lilies remove benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene, which — as you should know by now — are the most common toxins found in the home. The Boston fern will not only look nice in your home, it will also \"act as a natural air humidifier,\" according to Sustainable Baby Steps. English ivy, another pretty addition to the home, is known to remove toxins that are found in cigarette smoke. It's been reported that the plant can also be beneficial for those with asthma. Last but not least, the ficus is great to have in order to purify the air around you.\n",

            "Paragraph: I couldn't wait to put the trick to the test, and to my complete disbelief, I woke up the next morning unable to even remember getting to the eighth second of the exhale because it knocked me out that fast. For the next four nights leading up to the big day, even as my stress increased, I was able to fall asleep the minute I tried the 4-7-8 trick. I also used it to relax in the moments leading up to the speech. When you feel stressed or anxious, adrenaline courses through your veins, your heart beats at a rapid rate, and your breathing becomes quick and shallow. So before I get into the specifics behind how the trick works, I wanted to explain in my own words what it feels like when you try it. To me, the effect of the breathing technique feels almost like a sedative drug, because in order to hold your breath for seven seconds and then to exhale for eight—when your breath is so shallow and short—your body is forced to slow your heart rate. It has no choice. Holding your breath and then slowly, deliberately exhaling for eight seconds causes a chain reaction. It feels like going from a mad-dash sprint to a finish line to a slow, leisurely, calming stroll through the park. When you first start, you'll be desperate to just take in another breath, or you'll want to speed up your counting, but if you stick to the numbers (or at least try to) and don't take any breaks (in other words, consecutively repeat the 4-7-8 without resuming regular breathing), you can literally feel your heart rate slow down, your mind get quieter, and your whole body physically relax. It washes over you like a calming, relaxing drug. I can never remember getting past the first set of 4-7-8. Do you know the feeling of being put under by anesthesia, where you are conscious, and the next thing you remember is waking up? That's what this is like for me: As soon as I start the practice, the next thing I know, I'm waking up in the morning and can't even remember beginning the 4-7-8 count the night before. Crazy. Now to the more technical details: People who are stressed or anxious are actually chronically under-breathing, because stressed people breathe shortly and shallowly, and often even unconsciously hold their breath. By extending your inhale to a count of four, you are forcing yourself to take in more oxygen, allowing the oxygen to affect your bloodstream by holding your breath for seven seconds, and then emitting carbon dioxide from your lungs by exhaling steadily for eight seconds. The technique will effectively slow your heart rate and increase oxygen in your bloodstream, and may even make you feel slightly lightheaded, which contributes to the mild sedative-like effect. It will instantly relax your heart, mind, and overall central nervous system because you are controlling the breath versus continuing to breathe short, shallow gasps of air.\n",

            "Paragraph: When it comes to cooking, garlic is one of my favourite ingredients. And it’s such a versatile ingredient that it can be used in almost any savoury dish! Roasted with some proteins, stir-fried in some vegetables, blended into a creamy pasta sauce.... the list goes on and on. Personally, I absolutely love the flavour and aroma of garlic so when a recipe calls for two cloves of garlic, I’ll somehow justify to myself that I really should be putting in five or six. And the best part is that I don’t feel too guilty about it because garlic is healthy! Garlic can be used to help lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and prevent cancer, heart attacks, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. This superfood can also be used to help treat the common cold, the flu, bug bites, fungal infections, and traveller’s diarrhoea. Garlic is great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins, leading many people to consume it after chemotherapy. But while I love cooked garlic, garlic in its raw form is apparently how you’re going to get the best results. This is because heating garlic has been shown to reduce its anticancer properties and inactivate a key enzyme called alliinase. What you’ll want to do to maximise the health benefits of garlic is to crush it up raw, releasing the enzymes that will break down into good organosulfur compounds, and then eat it on an empty stomach. But raw garlic is incredibly pungent, so try this... Take 2-3 garlic cloves, chop up and crush them, and mix it with a tablespoon of honey (also healthy with anti-bacterial properties!). If you can consume it this way on a regular basis, it can go a long way in boosting your immune system!\n",

            "Topic: How to Beat Online Procrastination: Make It As Unenjoyable As Possible\n",
            "Paragraph: Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Thinkstock. This post originally appeared on Inside Higher Ed. The key to making online students focus on their coursework may be making procrastination as unenjoyable as possible, according to a study out of Cornell University. It’s a familiar problem to anyone with a deadline and a computer: The assignment is open on the screen, half-finished, but is quickly lost in a stack of Web browser tabs. Upon rediscovery (with an accompanying pang of guilt), the procrastinator resolves to buckle down and type out the last few paragraphs—right after clearing the notification that just popped up and checking just one more website. Richard W. Patterson, a Ph.D. student in policy analysis and management at Cornell, wanted to see if software could reduce procrastination and, as a result, improve students’ grades. \"People frequently fail to follow through on the plans they make: They fail to meet deadlines at work, finish assignments for school, go to the gym, and deposit money in their savings accounts,\" Patterson writes in the report, titled \"Can Behavioral Tools Improve Online Student Outcomes? Experimental Evidence From a Massive Open Online Course,\" published by the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute. In higher education, Patterson writes, that failure to follow through can be seen in the number of students who enroll in degree programs but never graduate. His study looked specifically at online education, where completion rates are lower than in face-to-face programs. MOOCs in particular have been sharply criticized for completion rates that sometimes register in the single digits. Patterson’s report, written last November but released this month, examines the effects of different types of anti-distraction software. His study looked at 657 students enrolled in a statistics MOOC offered by Stanford University. The students, all of whom agreed to download software that would track their activity online, were separated into three groups, plus a control group. Students in the group that tested a commitment tool set their own daily allotments for time they could spend on distracting websites such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and Facebook. If the students hit the cap during the course of a day, the software blocked them from the distracting sites, forcing students to give new reasons every time they wanted to unblock one. Students who used the commitment tool were 81 percent more likely to say the tool made procrastination less enjoyable. On average, students allotted 2.7 hours per day to spend on distracting websites and went over that limit four times during the nine-week MOOC. Even though the software sent them a daily email at 6:45 a.m. reminding them of that limit and asking if they wanted to reset it, the students only did so once on average. Students in the reminder group received notifications with links back to the course after every 30 minutes they spent on distracting websites. The notifications triggered an average of 48 times for each student in that group. Finally, students in the focus group were given the option to block access to distractions for 15, 30 ,or 60 minutes when they accessed the course. Students in that group activated that feature only 1.7 times on average during the MOOC, blocking distractions for 38 minutes. Only students testing the commitment tool showed statistically distinguishable performance improvements. Compared with those in the control group, the students spent 24 percent more time on coursework (or 5.5 hours), submitted 27 percent more homework assignments, and were 40 percent more likely to finish the MOOC. Their grades were also 0.29 standard deviations higher than those of students in the control group, which is \"roughly the same difference in course performance observed between students with Ph.D.s or M.D.s and students with bachelor’s degrees,\" according to the report. Patterson said he approached the study expecting the results from the first group to produce the most promising results, as that software in some ways included features tested in the other two groups. \"With the commitment device, you’d get an email asking if you would like to reset your limit—so it kind of acted like a reminder,\" Patterson said. \"It also had the incapacitating effect once you reached your limit that the focus study session included, but it also included this goal aspect of setting your own limit. I have a feeling that might be the most effective—adding something important on top.\" The results suggest a second reason for why the commitment tool was the most effective of those tested: Students in that group were 81 percent more likely than those in the control group to say the tool made procrastination less enjoyable. In other words, the software made wasting time a hassle, causing some students to go back to studying instead. Yet the results also present some limitations to anti-distraction software. Those most likely to benefit from software were those who, in a pre-course survey, said completing the MOOC was \"very\" or \"extremely\" important to them, leaving the question of how to help students who lack self-motivation largely unresolved, Patterson said. Patterson, who will this fall join the economics faculty at the United States Military Academy, said researching student behavior allowed him to face his own tendency to procrastinate.\n",

Look no further than Gabsee a new app that shows just how much fun AR can be. Make an avatar (think, 3D Bitmoji with fewer customization choices), choose a mood, and watch your avatar act out the mood right in front of you. Gabsee uses your phone's camera to overlay your avatar right onto your surroundings and you can record videos of your creation to share with friends outside of the app. Apple may have a new music partner. The tech giant is reportedly teaming up with Musical.ly, the popular music video app. Under the deal, which was first reported by Recode but hans't been officially announced, Apple Music will provide song snippets to the service (and promote its paid offering to the app's highly engaged younger users..) Okay, we all love emoji. But Samsung is putting everyone's favorite Unicode characters to good use with a new app called Wemogee that's meant to help people with speech disorders like aphasia, which affects people's ability to communicate with words. Designed with speech therapists and other professionals, Wemogee translates common words and phrases into emoji sequences that are easier to understand. The sender chooses the relevant emoji and, nce sent, the app translates the emoji into text for the receiver. Instagram crushed yet another milestone. The app now has 700 million monthly active users, up from 600 million just under four months ago. Samsung is working on an app to help combat distracted driving. In-Traffic Reply, which will launch next month, will automatically respond to your texts while you're in the car. Apple is reportedly working on a Venmo competitor, according to a new report in Recode. The service could be called Apple Cash, but it's not clear when it could launch. YouTube Kids, YouTube's kid-specific offering, is now available for smart TVs. \n",

            "Paragraph: Nowadays, many people are looking towards alternative medicine when treating illnesses. Commonly prescribed pills are not only packed with chemicals, but often come with serious side effects. If you don't like the idea of swallowing another pill and are looking to slowly expand your horizons, you should know that there are many alternative routes, including acupuncture. According to this Chinese form of alternative medicine, there is a specific point on the human ear that acts as a gateway to general wellness: the Shen Men, which translates to \"heavenly gate.\" Practiced in China for centuries, pressing this point on the external ear can help to relieve stress, anxiety, allergies, headaches, addiction, inflammation, depression, and pain. You can stimulate the Shen Men by pinching the point on your upper ear between your index finger and thumb. Moving your fingers in a circular motion, massage this point one to two times a day for about a minute. This treatment is incredibly simple and one that people can perform anywhere, at any time. The best part? No side effects!\n",

            "Topic: The One Strange Trick That Will Help You Live Longer: Have a Bunch of Money\n",
            "Paragraph: Meditating inside a beautiful stock-photo room filled with plants is just one health benefit not available to poor people. Photo via Getty Reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs—that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer? In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys—access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food—to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live. Here's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities—big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.—live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\" For the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live—they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\" The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\" The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco—rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012. Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\" But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy. \"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty. Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values.\n",

            "Paragraph: Security investigators linked thefts from banks in Asia, including the $81 million stolen from the central bank of Bangladesh in February, to a hacking group in North Korea. The research firm Symantec has been looking into the Bangladesh bank heist, and on Thursday it posted on its blog that a similar code used to steal Bangladesh’s millions was also used to hack a bank in the Philippines, as well as a failed attempt on a bank in Vietnam last year. The code, Symantec said, has also been linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures’s emails. Investigators say the malware the thieves used shared similarities to the code used by a hacking group known as Lazarus. The FBI has linked this group to the Sony hacks, and those hacks to North Korea. That group has also been tied to attacks as far back as 2009, which mainly focused on the U.S. and South Korea, but it is also believed to be responsible for hacks on countries all over the world, such as the $12 million stolen from an Ecuadoran bank last year. The way hackers broke into the banks was by infiltrating the industry’s global messaging system, SWIFT. The system is run by the world’s largest banks, is based in Brussels, and prides itself on security. The New York Times adds: North Korea’s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea’s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea’s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion. An expert quoted by the Times said: \"If you presume it’s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P. This is not small change for them.\" Since investigators learned how hackers stole Bangladesh’s money, banks that had kept similar heists quiet have come forward: Just last week, it was revealed in a lawsuit that the Banco del Austro in Ecuador was targeted, as well.\n",

            "Topic: A Body Part You Never Knew You Had Could Be Making You Miserable\n",
            "Paragraph: This mystery tissue could be what's making you feel stiff, creaky...and baffled. By Corrie Pikul You're Achy, You're Sore, and You Have No Idea Why It feels like muscle pain, but unlike a tight hamstring that makes you yelp when you stand up, your ache isn't triggered by a particular movement, and you can feel it in different places at various times. The culprit could be your fascia (pronounced \"fash-ya\"), says Mary Ann Wilmarth, DPT, chief of physical therapy at Harvard University Health Services. This sheet of tissue, made up of densely packed protein fibers, weaves throughout the entire body, and it binds and supports your muscles, bones and even your organs. While bodywork specialists have been passionate about fascia for decades, Wilmarth says it took new research on how fascia and muscles work together (some of it presented at the first international fascia research conference at Harvard in 2007) to get different health pros -- from orthopedists to MDs and pain experts to personal trainers -- to catch on. How Fascia Makes You Feel You have six times as many sensory neurons loaded in your fasciae as in any other tissue of your body except for your skin, explains Jill Miller, a fitness expert and longtime fascia evangelist (she's an experienced registered yoga teacher, has presented case studies at fascia research conferences and developed the Roll Model fascia therapy program). This internal webbing helps different muscle systems communicate with one another -- they're what make you want to get out of your office chair and stretch or roll your neck around. Ideally, your fascias should be supple enough to slide, glide, twist and bind like long, thin sheets of rubber. When they're not functioning properly, signals from the nerve endings are muffled or muted (so you don't feel comfortable in your own body) or they're interpreted by your brain as pain and discomfort. Find Your Inner Feline You know how your muscles feel cramped and stiff when you wake up in the morning? After a night's sleep (or another long period of inactivity, like a car trip or plane ride), the parts of your fascia that wrap around and through your muscle fibers, which are normally stretchy and flexible, can stick together like previously chewed Hubba Bubba. The fix: The best way to release the fascia is to slowly and luxuriously stretch out your arms and legs and roll slowly from side to side before getting out of bed. This will gently pull the muscles apart and separate the connecting tissue, Wilmarth says. To get at the fascia in your calves, ankles and arches, sit on the edge of the bed and flex and point your feet before putting the pressure of your weight on them. Roll It Out Like Bread Dough Fascia can be finicky: It gets stiff and sticky when you don't move around enough, but it can also get bound up and twisted when you move too much or do repetitive motion or injure yourself through activity, says James L. Thornton, the president of the National Athletic Trainers Association. The fix: Work out overused sore spots with a foam roller. You've probably seen people at the gym using these things, which look like pool noodles, to stretch their back, hamstrings and the notoriously tight IT band on the outside of the hips (this video from Jeff Richter, a certified strength and conditioning coach at St. Vincent Sports Performance in Indianapolis, provides a good foam-roller tutorial). Thornton says to go slowly, and when you get to a sore spot that feels like a bruise, pause for 15 to 20 seconds. The discomfort should melt away as the fascia softens and the muscles release. If you feel intense pain that doesn't dissipate, Thornton says to stop and consider making an appointment with a physical therapist. At home, you can give yourself a massage with tennis balls or Yoga Tune Up balls, which grip the skin to help loosen up individual layers of fascia. Also try a device called the Stick. It lets you really go deep into your calves, shins and hamstrings, but because it's more rigid than a foam roller, the Stick can feel much more intense (think deep-tissue massage versus regular rubdown). Stretch It Out You've heard that before exercising, it's a good idea to do some dynamic stretching that includes swinging your legs and arms to improve your range of motion. This not only benefits your muscles, says Thornton, but it's also a great way to loosen up your fascia. When your muscles stay tight, the fascia clings to them, and both can become rigid over time. The fix: Take a brisk walk or jog lightly in place, and do some sports-specific moves (for example, leg swings for runners, or shoulder rolls for swimmers). Or try the lazy woman's warm-up: Start your workout, and stay at a slow, easy, I could-do-this-for-hours pace for about 5 minutes. Don't Let the Tissues Get \"Crunchy\" If you've ever had a shoulder rub and heard something that sounded like crinkling plastic under your skin, that wasn't your imagination -- it was probably your parched, stiffened fascia, says Ruth Werner, a past president of the Massage Therapy Foundation, who spent decades teaching anatomy and physiology to other therapists. The collagen fibers that make up fascia need to stay supple to work properly, and to slide over and under muscles and other inner-body surfaces. The fix: One way to keep the fascia hydrated is obvious: drink lots of fluids, says Werner. Another easy (but easily forgettable) way is to make sure you stand up, stretch and flex regularly throughout the day to keep the fascia from locking up. Werner says some research has also shown that rubbing tight areas -- as when you get a massage -- can boost circulation and warm the fascia, changing the texture to make it even more pliable. Let the Pros Handle It Because fascia is so interconnected, snags -- or adhesions, as pros call them -- in one area can affect other other areas. \"Imagine putting on multiple layers of long-sleeve shirts, and then think about how tugging on one of them would cause all of the other shirts to pull and stretch as well,\" says Cynthia Ribeiro, the president of the American Massage Therapy Association and a massage therapist. She stresses that you can't have healthy muscles without well-cared-for fascia. The fix: There are different therapeutic methods to address keeping the fascia healthy, from intense, sometimes-excruciating Rolfing to gentle fascial unwinding to myofascial release, which usually involves loading the deeper tissues with force until they start to give. If you're chronically stiff and sore, or you have a muscle injury that just won't heal, consult a specialist to see what would be right for you. Massage therapists like Ribeiro and PTs like Wilmarth have seen clients for whom nothing seemed to work...until a type of fascial therapy helped melt away their pain and stiffness.\n",

            "Paragraph: Could advances in technology, genetics and artificial intelligence lead to a world in which economic inequality turns into biological inequality? asks the historian and writer Yuval Noah Harari. Inequality goes back at least 30,000 years. Hunter-gatherers were more equal than subsequent societies. They had very little property, and property is a pre-requisite for long-term inequality. But even they had hierarchies. In the 19th and 20th Centuries, however, something changed. Equality became a dominant value in human culture, almost all over the world. Why? It was partly down to the rise of new ideologies such as humanism, liberalism and socialism. But it was also about technological and economic change - which was connected to those new ideologies, of course. Suddenly the elite needed large numbers of healthy, educated people to serve as soldiers in the army and as workers in the factories. Governments didn't educate and vaccinate to be nice. They needed the masses to be useful. But now that's changing again. The best armies today require a small number of highly professional soldiers using very high-tech kit. Factories, too, are increasingly automated. This is one reason why we might - in the not-too-distant future - see the creation of the most unequal societies that have ever existed in human history. And there are other reasons to fear such a future. With rapid improvements in biotechnology and bioengineering, we may reach a point where, for the first time in history, economic inequality becomes biological inequality. Until now, humans had control of the world outside them. They could control the rivers, forests, animals and plants. But they had very little control of the world inside them. They had limited ability to manipulate and engineer their own bodies, brains and minds. They couldn't cheat death. That might not always be the case. There are two main ways to upgrade humans. Either you change something in their biological structure by changing their DNA. Or, the more radical way, you combine organic and inorganic parts - perhaps directly connecting brains and computers. The rich - through purchasing such biological enhancements - could become, literally, better than the rest; more intelligent, healthier and with far greater life-spans. At that point, it will make sense to cede power to this \"enhanced\" class. Think about it like this. In the past, the nobility tried to convince the masses that they were superior to everyone else and so should hold power. In the future I am describing, they really will be superior to the masses. And because they will be better than us, it will make sense to cede power and decision-making to them. We might also find that the rise of artificial intelligence - and not just automation - will mean that huge numbers of people, in all kinds of jobs, simply lose their economic usefulness. The two processes together - human enhancement and the rise of AI - may result in the separation of humankind into a very small class of super-humans and a massive underclass of \"useless\" people. Here's a concrete example. Think about the transportation market. You have thousands of lorry, taxi and bus drivers in the UK. Each of them commands a small share of the transportation market, and they gain political power because of that. They can unionise and if the government does something they don't like, they can go on strike and shut down the entire transportation system. Now fast-forward 30 years. All vehicles are self-driving. One corporation controls the algorithm that controls the entire transport market. All the economic power previously shared by thousands, and all their political power, is now in their hands of a single corporation. Once you lose your economic importance, the state loses at least some of the incentive to invest in your health, education and welfare. It's very dangerous to be redundant. Your future depends on the goodwill of some small elite. Maybe there is goodwill. But in a time of crisis - like climate catastrophe - it would be very easy to toss you overboard. Technology is not deterministic. We can still do something about all this. But I think we should be aware that what I'm describing is one possible future. If we don't like this possibility, we need to act before it's too late. There is one more possible step on the road to previously unimaginable inequality. In the short-term, authority might shift to a small elite that owns and controls the master algorithms and the data that feeds them. In the longer term, however, authority could shift completely from humans to the algorithms. Once AI is smarter than us, all humanity could be made redundant. What would happen after that? We have absolutely no idea. We literally can't imagine it. How could we? We are talking about an intelligence far greater than that which humanity currently possesses.\n",

            "Paragraph: Arthur Brooks, president of the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, is challenging Republicans to reconsider their aversion to welfare programs. During the \"Right To Rise: Education as America’s 21st Century Ticket to Social Mobility\" event, Brooks recalled recent visits to \"off the map\" areas neglected by politicians because they're home to voters who are either certain they'll vote for them or certain they won't. After speaking with people in the areas -- \"prostitutes, drug addicts, ex-felons, homeless people\" -- Brooks said they called for three things. \"Transformation, relief and opportunity, in that order,\" he said. The top conservative considered the partisan discourse surrounding support for those who need it, saying the far left calls for endless amounts of relief, while the far right calls for enterprise. \"One of the things, in my view, that we get wrong in the free enterprise movement is this war against the social safety net, which is just insane,\" Brooks said. Brooks' comments came weeks before an automatic decrease to food stamp benefits set for Nov. 1, in which the average family will see a $36 cut in their benefits. \"The government social safety net for the truly indigent is one of the greatest achievements of our society,\" said Brooks. \"And we somehow want to zero out food stamps or something, it’s nuts to want to be doing something like that. We have to declare peace on the safety net.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: During a Q&A on Twitter, J.K. Rowling made a surprising revelation about Rubeus Hagrid, one of the best-loved characters from the Harry Potter series. When a fan asked Rowling what form Hagrid's Patronus would take – a great question, considering Hagrid's unusual taste in pets – she replied : \"Hagrid couldn't produce a Patronus. It's a very difficult spell.\" In both the books and the films, the Patronus charm is one of the most powerful defense spells a witch or wizard can cast to ward off Dementors, the dark creatures that feed off human happiness. It's one of the most complex spells in the wizarding world, and in order to conjure a Patronus, a wizard needs to draw upon his most powerful happy memory. The Charm conjures a magical guardian in the shape of the animal with whom the witch or wizard shares the greatest affinity. Rowling's response may point to the fact that the spell is simply too difficult for Hagrid, who was expelled from Hogwarts as a teenager, to perform. But fans were also worried that the lovable half-giant, abandoned by his mother as a child, may just not have enough happy memories to produce a Patronus. Oh, Hagrid!\n",

Taylor Swift’s reign as pop music’s sweetheart may be coming to an end... and fast. Swift’s behavior in recent weeks has left some of her longtime fans questioning their devotion to the \"Shake it Off\" singer. On Wednesday, Swift’s most recent ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris slammed the starlet on Twitter and fueled rumors that she was out to take down Katy Perry. Perry then responded to Harris’ outburst with a retweet of a message she’d sent out in May 2015 that read, \"Time, the ultimate truth teller.\" The tweets begged the question: Is Swift actually a mean girl? And now, Swift fans are taking sides, and her critics are celebrating the rapid influx of negative attention the starlet is getting. Some die-hard Swift fans admit they are bothered by her recent behavior. But a fair amount of Swift’s supporters are steadily standing by her. Swift has made headlines in recent weeks for her whirlwind, PDA-filled relationship with Tom Hiddleston, which came just weeks after her breakup with Harris. Then, she threw and over-the-top celeb-filled Fourth of July bash, showing off her A-list group of friends. On Wednesday, news broke that Swift's team confirmed that she wrote one of Harris' hits, which didn't sit well with her ex, causing Harris to rant against her on Twitter. In the past, Swift has been celebrated as one of Hollywood's nicest celebs, with a loyal group of A-list friends singing her praises. She's also been known to visit ill fans and treat her supporters to special surprises, all while seemingly staying away from the darker drug-filled side of the Hollywood party scene, making her a role model to young fans.\n",

            "Paragraph: This weekend, I had the opportunity to see the play Pay Up here in Philadelphia by the inimitable Pig Iron Theatre Company. If you're looking for a review, you won't find it here, other than to say -- if you live in this city and if you can, try to get tickets. The piece deals with the intersection of art and commerce, of emotion and human psychology, and it is funny and moving in a way that I can't quite articulate just yet. Here's what I actually want to talk about. I went home and began to leaf through the playbill, a slim, stapled offering handed to me upon my exit. The quote that stopped me dead in my tracks was tucked into a tiny back corner of the program, buried under the lists of donors and sponsors and advertising. Printed at the very bottom of the page, here's what I read: I don't know if this blew your mind, but mine exploded across the kitchen. Bear with me on this, because I really need to reason this out. Let's say I'm in the grocery store, and I'm in the mood for jam. OK. I can deal with this. Cherry. Blueberry. Lemon. Raspberry. Mint. Orange. I can narrow this down pretty quickly. Mint jam is weird. Lemon is too tart. Blueberry and Raspberry are too seedy. Orange is always artificial-tasting. Cherry it is. Let's say I go to a bigger grocery store. Crap. I think I... I mean, I used to like cherry, but... there are so many other kinds out here. I didn't even know they made pomegranate-plum. What's a persimmon again? OK. With me so far? This makes sense. It shouldn't, but it does. Too many choices make me feel anxious. What if I choose incorrectly? Maybe I just don't want jam after all. Forget it. I'll just go home without it, or buy something else instead. After all, the perfect jam has to be out there somewhere. Why waste my time and money on all these other ones? Now. Let's say I'm a single lady in a small town. Say, not in the present day. Let's say, just for the sake of argument, I'm a single lady in a small town in some year before the invention of the automobile or the telephone. In order to leave my small town, I would have to travel by horseback. In order to hear news from other places in the world, I would either have to receive a letter, hear someone tell me a story, or go out and find the information myself. Let's say I'm a single lady in a small town and the ol' hormones kicked in and I'm really interested in having sex and, I guess, by association, getting married and making babies. Now, let's go visit that small, hometown grocery store. OK. OK. I can deal with this. Not the one with the crazy eyes. Not the one who smells bad. Probably the one who has a kind smile and seems to think I'm funny. Yeah. OK. Him it is. (For the sake of not being viewed as a total moron, I should state that this is an incredibly simplified way of viewing world history. If you were a woman living in the days before the automobile and the telephone, and you were fortunate enough not to have been born, say, a slave, or a street urchin, or in a time where your father or male relatives could sell you like property, you still simply didn't have a lot of options, and that sucks. Even if you did wind up lucking out with a really delicious kind of jam, like, say, pear, you still kinda had to hope that after years and years and years of eating pear jam for every meal, that you still liked the flavor as much as when you first opened the jar. You kinda just had to hope that pear jam wasn't the kind of saccharine-based life form who would beat you or deny you the right to vote or otherwise generally be an asshole.) OK. Let's say it's somewhat later in our collective history. Let's say we're a single gal in a somewhat larger town. Crap. There's just a lot of choices out there. What if I choose wrong? What if this isn't the one I'm supposed to be with? What if there's someone else out there who is the right flavor, and I made a hasty decision too soon because I thought I was supposed to be done with the grocery shopping by a certain time and place in my life? Ok. Now, let's say it's the year 2013. Let's say you live in a large metropolitan area. Let's say that the last year's census for the city of Philadelphia clocked in at 1,547,607 people. Some of these people are old, some are children, some are married. Approximately 43% of Americans are unmarried and over the age of 18. So, while we're doing some guesstimating here, because I can't find specific information on the number of unmarried folks in Philadelphia per se, let's say that there are approximately 665,471 unmarried people in this city. On average, there are slightly more women than men in this city, but let's make it easy on ourselves and divide that number in half. So, let's just say that there are 332,735.5 unmarried men in this city. (Let's round up to 332,736, because I hate to imagine that poor half-man out there alone in the city on this rainy night). Now, let's look at those 332,736 men. Some of them are probably old. Some of them are probably gay. Some of them probably wear Ed Hardy baseball caps. I can disregard those flavors of jam pretty easily. Still. Just looking at this picture gives me the nervous poops. And this is why online dating made me totally miserable. There were simply too many choices. I was so overwhelmed by the number of options, and yet so oddly disappointed that none of them appeared to say \"Hey! I'm your future husband!\" right there on the page. When there are that many options, it's all the more frustrating that the obvious choice is harder to find. I would scroll through a seemingly endless supply of men who purportedly lived in my very own city but whom I had never seen before, until the only option was to just eliminate people for purely superficial reasons. Works in a bank? Boring. Has a cat? Eh. Has a beard? I guess I like beards. Went to Burning Man? Oh, dear, probably not. All the while, I was equally aware of how many of those same men had to be flipping through a seemingly endless supply of single women, staring at my profile and thinking, \"Likes to read. They all say that. Mel Brooks movies? Whatever. Nice eyes, but a little pudgy around the middle.\" I went on one real date. He was nice enough, but I didn't feel the connection, and plus that online superficiality had utterly bled into the real-life encounter. I realized about five minutes into it that he was a totally nice and decent and well-educated person that I had written off upon first glance because he arrived at the bar wearing a pink paisley shirt and purple skinny jeans. I spent the rest of the evening unable to focus on a word he said, because my own inner monologue kept repeating over and over and over, Stop being such a superficial asshole. The night I deleted my account for good, I had gone out dancing with some friends at this big dance party on a boat. It turned into one of those epic evenings where tons of people I know turned up, all of whom work in my industry, all dancing together, just sweating it out on this hot summer night to Michael Jackson and Prince and Beyoncé. And I was having fun, until the very end of the night, where -- cue the world's smallest violin -- everybody else seemed to pair off and disappear together and I was left on South Street, hailing a cab alone. F*ck this, I thought, the Internet is full of all of these other choices! There are literally thousands and thousands of men out there, in the vast array of the universe, in this expansive and vibrant city. I am a smart, capable, attractive, single lady. There's no shame in this. I'm so sick of always going out and seeing the same people, only ever meeting people who work in the same field. I just want to meet someone completely different, someone who is nothing like the people I work with all day and socialize with all night. I turned on the computer and logged into OkCupid. There's this screen when you log in that shows you your \"Three Top-Rated New Matches!\" I sh*t you not, this is what popped up on the homepage: I knew all three. I had kissed ALL three. All three worked in my field. All three were my top-rated matches. All three had been at the boat dance party that night. I deleted the account, put on my pajamas, and ate a bag of popcorn while watching \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\" until the sun came up. Somewhere out there, I gotta believe there's a jam jar waiting around for me. I really have to think so. Why else would we have so many stories and fairytales and folklore and mystique about picking the right one off the shelf? At the same time: I'm easily overwhelmed. Thinking about the reality without using metaphor is more complicated, more lonely, more sad. I sometimes catch myself feeling a little jealous of my friends who married young, who stayed in their small-town grocery stores. They seem to have figured something out in a way that I can't, or won't. I read those statistics, the ones in those articles that always have headlines like COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN FREAK SHARKNADO FIRE THAN MARRY AFTER AGE 35, and they wear on my soul in a way that I'm not totally comfortable admitting. The worst part of all of this is, I mostly love my life as a single lady. I really don't have too many complaints. Unlike our theoretical single-gal example from earlier, the one with six options and a horse, I am afforded the benefits of freedom of speech and religion and the right to vote and wear pants and take birth control and get a job and serve in the military. I realize that this complaint might seem incredibly petty. Woe is me! I have too many choices! There are simply too many things to do in this vast and incredible world! I have a job that I love! I surround myself with other single friends who are creative, fun and supportive people! I have dated some extremely smart, talented men, and I'm so glad I didn't have to marry them, because they were totally wrong for me! I get to have the bed to myself every night and no one will care if I eat grilled cheese in it! Poor, poor, single, lonely me, unabashedly living a terrific life! And yet, sometimes, you sit back, and the bed seems kinda empty, and you really just want some f*cking jam. I don't really have a good answer for that. Except, I guess, to take a deep breath. To remember that grocery shopping is not a race. To stop looking at what everyone else has in their shopping cart. And to remember that even though it sucks and it scares me, I have to keep walking back into that store.\n",

            "Paragraph: No soup for you! Those four little words became one of the most famous lines across the nine seasons of \"Seinfeld.\" Larry Thomas is the actor who barked that phrase as the show’s infamous \"Soup Nazi,\" and as he tells \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\", Thomas is still associated with the character even decades after his television debut. \"Twenty years later, I am recognized more than I ever have been before,\" he says. Many fans, Thomas adds, say a similar thing to him when expressing their love of the Soup Nazi ― but as kind as the sentiment is, it’s got a faulty premise. \"More than any other things that are ever said to me is, ‘I loved all the episodes with the Soup Nazi,’\" Thomas says. \"And I go, ‘All one of them?’\" It’s true: The Soup Nazi bit was only six minutes of total airtime. Though the character had a brief cameo in the series finale, Thomas points out that the Soup Nazi wasn’t recurring in the way people often assume. \"There’s an urban myth that there was more than one [Soup Nazi episode],\" Thomas says. \"I go, ‘There’s just one!’\" Today, in addition to acting and writing, Thomas has become the official spokesman for The Original Soupman, the inspiration behind the Soup Nazi episode. \"This is actually the place that’s been here since 1984 that the episode of ‘Seinfeld’ was written about,\" Thomas says. As for his catchphrase, Thomas can’t help but say it ― finger point and all ― on occasion, to customers’ delight. Catch Thomas’ full update on \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\", airing Saturday, Sept. 10, at 10 p.m. ET on OWN. You can also watch the episode on demand with the Watch OWN app.\n",

            "Topic: Why Touch Is So Important In A Loving Marriage\n",
            "Paragraph: For starters, we all know that good sex can be fun, romantic, exciting, and something that makes most consenting adults feel warm and fuzzy all over. Over the years we have interviewed thousands of successfully married couples, and most report a reasonable degree of satisfaction with their sex life. But here is our most important research finding concerning this issue: no marriage was ever made successful because the couple had a great sex life! And more importantly, when we asked successfully married couples how important sex is to the success of their marriage — to rank on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest — the average rank was only 6! This finding has held true over the more than 30 years of our research. The results are hardly a resounding endorsement for the importance of sex in a successful marriage. You see, marriage is a multi-faceted and highly complex relationship, and in the best marriages, no one aspect stands out as the \"make or break\" part of it. The truth is, there are seven pervasive characteristics present in all successful marriages. And guess what: sex isn't one of them! Sex is only one part of the seven characteristics of a successful marriage. As we say so often in our many interviews and writings, all of the married couples, representing the best marriages we've interviewed, have shared with us the importance of touching in their relationship. One gentleman we interviewed told us that if he passed his wife in the house a hundred times a day, he touched her. To touch someone you love is to acknowledge their presence and to communicate your desire for them. That's why the most successfully married couples amongst us do it so often. We believe that the overemphasis of sex on television, in the media, and in books about marriage cause people to believe that if they don't have stupendous sex everyday, there is something wrong with their marriage. But marriages that fail do so for a variety of reasons, not for a single reason. Simply put, our research findings hold true that no marriage was ever saved, or made successful because the couple had a great sex life. We've reported many first-hand accounts from successfully married couples who tell us how important the human touch is to a loving marriage. They hug each other often, they kiss, they touch each other while talking, they sit cheek to cheek on the couch while having a conversation, they curl around each other when they sleep or just gaze at the stars, and yes, they have sex from time to time — when it's right for them. You see, people touch each other in many, many different ways, and no single form of touching wins the day. It's what we like to call \"the accumulation of touching\" that matters. Touch the one you love often and in whatever way your heart desires. It's that human connection that wins the day — and wins the marriage! The simple truth is, the best marriages engage in a lot of touching, and sex is only one form of touching. Creating a successful marriage is not always the easiest thing to do. And truthfully, we've learned in over 30 years of marriage research that there are proven, effective ways to ensure a happy and healthy marriage. In fact, as love and marriage experts, we took hundreds of tips from the thousands of happy couples we interviewed throughout the world and put them into our award-winning and bestselling book, \"Building a Love that Lasts.\" You can see how you stack up to the best marriages around the world.

            "Topic: ‘Follow your passion’ is wrong, here are 7 habits you need instead\n",
            "Paragraph: It’s common wisdom. Near gospel really, and not just among young people and founders. Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs’ 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness:   \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\"  In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\"  That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment.  Newport’s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong.  Here are seven habits you need instead.  Ryan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy: \"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\"  Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why?  Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first.  Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\"  Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized.  Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing: \"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\"  Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head.  The blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\"  And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots.  Sleep on it. Reach out. The sun will rise tomorrow. And be ruthless with your \"No’s.\"  Angela Duckworth, author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance: \"After you’ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year.\"  We all love shortcuts. The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely.   The classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they’d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\"  What accounted for this reversal of expectations?   Easy: while the quality group held back — laboring under perfectionism — the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that’s good news. If greatness came down to passion — or worse, talent — then it’d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another.  Liran Kotzer, CEO of Woo.io: \"Passion is indeed very important, but what most people don't know is what’s needed to achieve their true potential. Whether it’s to acquire new skills, get a promotion, or achieve what they want, it all starts with having a plan based on real data and real-world options.\"  The only word less sexy than practice is planning. And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be.  Optimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what’s next — the nitty-gritty actions that’ll get us there — optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \"real data and real-world options,\" we build castles in the sky. That’s one of the reasons platform like Woo, which lets you get feedback from companies and headhunters anonymously, are so valuable.  Where passion disconnects us from reality, planning — especially planning of the SMART goal and number-crunching variety — drives home the true state of affairs.   That true state rescues us from false expectations, show stoppers, and resentment. As a good friend of mine likes to say, \"The question when you’re trying to bring a dream into reality shouldn’t be, ‘What going to go right?’ It should be, ‘What’s going to go wrong?’\"  Jason Stone, founder of Millionaire Mentor Inc.: \"Passion can only take you so far. After that, if you don't have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won’t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\"  Humans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting.  \"The basic approach of positioning,\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us.  Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and — while it still leaves room for confidence — acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves.  Troy Osinoff, author of My Bad Parent: Do As I Say, Not as I Did: \"People that think they completely understand their world are the most susceptible to overlook new opportunities. Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\"  Passion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion.  Adopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed.  How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want.  Brian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur: \"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\"  Although it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \"pushing through.\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes.  Asked if the Patriot’s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \"greatest game ever,\" Tom Brady replied: \"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don’t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the ‘best games ever’ but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\"  Certainly Brandy persevered, and it’d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won’t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh.   Failure, however, isn’t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don’t give up, you will get better.\"  Understood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all? Yes.  Cal Newport’s prescription was skill: passion is the result of excellence, not it’s source.   Far from a magic bullet, passion can mislead us, blind us, and even turn us in on ourselves. Newport was right: \"‘Follow your passion’ might just be terrible advice.\" Thankfully, these seven habits put passion in its place so that the fire Jobs spoke of doesn’t burn out ... but endures.

            "Paragraph: With the government shutdown now over, citizens of this weary nation can turn their eyes toward the week's other big dust-up: Drake versus Future. According to Hot 107.9, the rappers have apparently buried their differences and will tour together. \"Papers are signed, time to get that money again,\" Hot 107.9 disc jockey Beestroh said while announcing the news. The backstory: On Monday, New York Post's Page Six reported that Drake had kicked Future off his North American tour after the 26-year-old rapper apparently dinged Drake's \"Nothing Was The Same\" album in an interview with Billboard. \"Drake made an album that is full of hits but it doesn't grab you,\" Future reportedly told the magazine. \"They're not possessive; they don't make you feel the way I do. I want to make you want to fall in love.\" Following the publication of that interview, Future said he was taken out of context. The quote, it should be noted, no longer appears in the original Billboard article. Future was reportedly set to sue the Toronto rapper for $1.5 million in damages. Drake's North American tour continues in Pittsburgh on Friday. UPDATE: Future released a statement on Thursday confirming that he will be touring with Drake. According to MissInfo, his statement read, \"I am set to continue as planned with Drake and Miguel on the 'Would You Like A Tour?' tour slated to begin on October 18th in Pittsburgh, PA. I’m looking forward to hitting the road this fall. Love4Life Honest.\" FALL MUSIC PREVIEW 2013\n",

            "Paragraph: Beyond the Rio 2016 Games, music is a ritual for Phelps: ‘I have walked out to race with my headphones on throughout my whole career’ Seconds before diving into the pool for his impressive leg of the 4x100m relay final on Sunday, Michael Phelps was still wearing his headphones. The music is something of a pre-race ritual for Phelps, in addition to cupping. \"I have walked out to race with my headphones on throughout my whole career and listen to music until the last possible moment,\" he told the Guardian in 2005, just after winning six gold medals in the Athens Olympics. \"It helps me to relax and get into my own little world.\" The routine seems to work pretty well. Phelps and his team won the relay, earning him his 19th gold medal – but it certainly received a lot of attention. Some worried the swimmer would accidentally jump in with his headphones on. Many coveted a warm-up playlist from the most decorated Olympian – sometimes with their own speculation. Kate Caratenuto (@khcara) Very curious as to what Michael Phelps is listening to in those headphones. Is it Bruce Springsteen? Queen? The Shrek soundtrack? Lmk Sara Benincasa (@SaraJBenincasa) What is #MichaelPhelps hype music? Tim Federle (@TimFederle) Every time I see Michael Phelps in those big Beats headphones I think: Which \"Les Miz\" recording is he listening to?? Phelps hasn’t revealed his playlist this year – though the New York Times wrote that it is a mix of Eminem, Young Jeezy and the country singer Eric Church. He told the Guardian back in 2005 that he likes Eminem, Dr Dre and Notorious BIG. He had even gone to a Snoop Dogg concert in that year and met the rapper the Game backstage. \"I didn’t get to meet Snoop. He doesn’t ‘meet’ people,\" Phelps said. Rolling Stone published a few of Phelps’ warm-up jams in 2012. His \"solid gold hits\" included I’m Me and Right Above It by Lil Wayne – \"That song made me want to finish strong and look forward to life after swimming\" – No Beef by Afrojack and Steve Aoki, Levels by Avicii and Go Getta by Young Jeezy. Phelps and the rest of the USA swimming team did their own take on James Corden’s popular carpool karaoke segment ahead of the games – though it’s unclear if they used his personal playlist. With Phelps at the wheel, he sang along to Chicken Fried by Zac Brown Band. Even a phone call from his mom couldn’t interrupt Phelps from jamming out. During the race in Rio, Phelps sported Beats headphones – a departure from his previous brand of choice, Sol Republic. After he wore Sol headphones at the 2012 Games, the brand came out with a line of Phelps-inspired headphones. In a video from Sol Republic, the swimmer said his first cassette was Green Day and he likes to listen to hip-hop in the morning and techno before workouts. With both sets of headphones, Phelps had to cover the logos with tape for the cameras. Phelps’ son was seen emulating dad at the race on Sunday.

            "Topic: Kentucky ranked worst state for animal safety for 10th consecutive year\n",
            "Paragraph: A comprehensive review of animal safety laws throughout the United States found that Kentucky has the weakest protections in the country — a dubious honor it’s held for a decade. The Animal Legal Defense Fund released its 11th annual report on animal protection rankings on Tuesday. Illinois topped the list of best protections for the ninth consecutive year, followed by Oregon, Maine , California and Rhode Island. Kentucky came in dead last for the 10th straight year. Other states with weak animal protection laws include Iowa (49th), Wyoming (48th), Utah (47th) and North Dakota (46th). Lora Dunn, the senior staff attorney of the Animal Legal Defense Fund’s Criminal Justice Program, said the organization looked at 15 distinct categories of animal protection laws in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. \"We would like to see Kentucky make some very important changes to make sure that animals are protected now and in the future from known offenders,\" Dunn said in an interview with Yahoo News. According to Dunn, Kentucky falls short in terms of its felony penalties for animal cruelty: There is no consequence for neglect, sexual assault or abandonment of an animal, for instance. \"We’d really like to see the punishment fit the crime in those situations,\" she told Yahoo News. \"Kentucky is the only state in the country that specifically prohibits veterinarians from reporting animal cruelty. The majority of states either allow or require by law that veterinarians who suspect animal cruelty to report it to law enforcement.\" Additionally, she said, Kentucky is the only state that doesn’t require that animals be forfeited from a convicted offender’s custody after he or she has been convicted. She said statistics show that someone who has harmed animals is more likely to hurt animals again in the future and to hurt humans as well. On the other end of the spectrum, Dunn said, Illinois remains on top because there are felony penalties covering virtually every kind of mistreatment, including abuse, neglect, fighting, sexual assault and abandonment. Across the country, the Animal Legal Defense Fund has largely seen positive changes regarding animal safety. Wisconsin was the most-improved state of the year, jumping 14 places in rank, from the bottom tier to number 30 overall. This was partly thanks to a new cost-of-care law. \"We’re seeing very encouraging trends regarding animal protection legislation. In particular, we’re seeing a trend regarding cost-of-care laws,\" she said. These mandate that [when] care-giving agencies that come to the rescue to help animals in need — that have been seized as part of a criminal investigation — the cost and burden of caring for those animals lies with the offender.\" In other words, comprehensive cost-of-care laws place the financial responsibility of caring for an animal squarely with the person who has harmed it. Dunn said there’s also been a promising trend regarding \"dogs in hot cars laws,\" which criminalize leaving an animal in a hot car and affirms the right of other people to save these animals in certain circumstances. The rescue provisions kick in \"after calling 911, after having a good faith belief that these animals are in danger and after taking other steps to notify the owner,\" she said. \"More than 20 states have passed laws that allow citizens to come to the rescue of these animals in really dangerous situations.\" The Animal Legal Defense Fund’s annual rankings are based on a review of each jurisdiction’s animal protection laws, which include more than 4,000 pages of statutes.\n",

You’ve got the biggest stars–including your boss–and you’re right on the cusp of permanently taking over hip-hop. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, you jump ship from the label that pays you. That’s the position Imagine you’re at the height of your career on the most popular and powerful label in the game. You’ve got the biggest stars–including your boss–and you’re right on the cusp of permanently taking over hip-hop. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, you jump ship from the label that pays you. That’s the position Snoop Dogg found himself in during the mid ’90s when he left Death Row for No Limit. After 20 years, Snoop’s finally ready to explain to the world why he bounced. In an interview with CRWN, the once and future Doggfather revealed that Suge Knight had an issue with him trying to break bread with The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy. Knight was doing a bid at the time so Snoop felt that maybe time behind bars would’ve provided the Death Row CEO some clarity. \"Just to share this with you and y’all, when he was locked up, it was a pivotal moment where I wanted to go see him and I couldn’t see him because they shut the visiting down,\" he told the audience. \"But I was able to get on the phone with him and I was like, ‘Cuz, why don’t you let me shake Biggie and Puffy’s hand on TV and end this so we can figure out a way to move forward?’\" After Tupac was killed and a few months before Biggie would see the same fate, Snoop wanted to squash everything. For his peacemaking troubles, Snoop was met with a stern response from Knight and his people. \"Fuck them bitch *ss n****s.\" Suge Knight, always the diplomat. From that point on, Snoop says things were different. Knight and his crew turned on Snoop because he wasn’t \"with the business.\" The writing was on the wall and shortly after he went to No Limit, did a sequel to From that point on, Snoop says things were different. Knight and his crew turned on Snoop because he wasn’t \"with the business.\" The writing was on the wall and shortly after he went to No Limit, did a sequel to \"Nuthin’ but a G Thang\" –for some reason–and went on to completely reinvent himself.

But, the fact that it all stemmed from him trying to make peace between two brothers he liked and respected is asinine. Meaning it’s typical Suge Knight.

Sadly, that never came to fruition but one has to wonder how that would’ve played out in their West Coast headquarters. \"Fuck them bitch *ss n****s.\" Oh. Right. That’s how. All of this leads me to believe there’s money to be printed with a Death Row biopic. So. Much. Money. It’s the best idea staring us all in the face, hiding in plain sight and my guess the only thing stopping it would be, of course, Suge Knight. It could almost be the spinoff to Straight Outta Compton , detailing the rise and fall of Dre’s other venture with a lot more time and attention–and accuracy– devoted to it than what we got in the third act of the 2015 hit movie.

            "Paragraph: EA Finally Reveals Why Star Wars: Battlefront Didn’t Have A Single Player Campaign Image: starwars.ea.com Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn’t have single player campaign while speaking during EA’s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game. The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy. Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn’t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic. He said, \"The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact.\" \"I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it’s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we’re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,\" he added. Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline ‘Missions’. He also detailed how EA is looking into the ‘depth and breadth’ before starting a new project. \"The depth and breadth is something that’s proving to be more and more important,\" he said. \"In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important.\" Soderlund added, \"We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one.\" On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds. Keeping in mind, Soderlund’s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.\n",

            "Paragraph: Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing \"terrible human and economic cost\", a major study has warned. Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop. Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption , increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock. The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK. Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA) It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use. The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050.   Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00  Fullscreen Playback Rate 1  Subtitles subtitles off  Captions captions settings captions settings captions off  Chapters Chapters  Mute 00:00  Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done  Close Share Video: Share via:  Facebook  Google+  Twitter  tumblr  Pinterest  LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code:  Restart Antibiotics crisis is global Lord O’Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.\" Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\" Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections.

            "Paragraph: Back in 2009, a lab full of chemists stumbled across a new pigment, more or less by sheer chance. After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists’ brushes. This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200°C (2,000°F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\" The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. \"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment. He added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. I realized immediately that something amazing had happened.\" So, what’s so special about this blue? This pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. Additionally, unlike Prussian blue or Cobalt blue pigments, it doesn’t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic – that's always a plus. Not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light. Subramanian told Artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties. The paint manufacturers Shepherd Color Company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of YInMn blue. He added: \"Our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable.\" [H/T: Mental Floss]\n",

            "Paragraph: A sign hangs above at the Amazon.com Inc. fulfillment center in Hemel Hempstead, U.K., on Wednesday, Nov. 25, 2015. Wal-Mart and Amazon’s toy pricing was almost equal on a three-week average leading into the holiday season, as both companies continue to provide the most competitive prices in the marketplace. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Despite being such an enormous company, and an important name in the music space for years now, Amazon.com has been fairly quiet on the streaming front. Now, it looks like that is about to change. According to a report published by Recode , the company is looking to dive headfirst into the highly competitive streaming music industry in its own way. Sources say that Amazon is looking to launch a new streaming service in the coming months that would come with the discounted price of only $5 (or potentially even $4), but as is the case whenever anything seems too cheap to be real, there is a catch. The streaming platform and all of the music offered on it would only be playable via Amazon’s Echo device, which the company has made a priority ever since it launched just over one year ago. Apparently, Amazon has yet to get all of the major labels to sign off on the product, which isn’t shocking, considering that those that own the rights to music aren’t too keen to give it away for even cheaper prices than they already are. While other big companies in the streaming music space have failed to be able to lower the cost of monthly subscriptions—including Apple, which reportedly wanted to offer its option to consumers for less than its rivals when it first launched—Amazon may be able to get the three majors on board with this plan, since unlike paid tiers on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, this new product wouldn’t allow users to store tracks and albums on their phones, essentially replacing downloads entirely. This new Echo-specific idea isn’t the only project that Amazon reportedly has in the works when it comes to streaming. It’s been known for some time that the company has been prepping a more traditional new product that would compete with the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, likely for a $10 a month subscription fee. Not much is known about what Amazon has been cooking up, but hopefully, the company brings something new to the table, as opposed to adding another option to an already crowded space.\n",

However, the game doesn’t allow you to change your team once you pick it after reaching level 5. There might be a few cheats but all of them would result in losing your current game’s progress and stats. Thankfully, there seems to be a workaround to this as several users and Redditors have reported about successfully contacting Niantic in order to change their team even after choosing one after they reached level 5. Be warned though, Niantic will only accept your request for changing team once and you can’t keep changing them as you like. This is to ensure you want to change the team as you picked the wrong team by mistake. Another thing to note is that they will only accept your request if you’re low level and have not spent a lot of time with your chosen team. To change team, all you have to do is click this link . After clicking the link you will be redirected to the official website of Niantic, where you’ll be given an option to change your team for another one of your choice via a support form. You’ll just need to provide some minimal details like e-mail id, nickname, OS version etc in this process. Make sure to describe why you want to change your team in the ‘additional request tab’ and if you’ve followed the above, you might just well be able to choose a new team even after initially picking a different one. This process is tedious but worth the effort if you feel you’ve joined the wrong team by mistake. This might take a bit of time since many people are submitting requests. Let us know if you were able to successfully change your team using this method.\n",

I would like to meet him.\" Obama, 58, a longtime Democrat, said his \"deep disappointment\" in his brother Barack’s administration has led him to recently switch allegiance to \"the party of Lincoln.\" Barack Obama is seen with his half-brother, Malik. Photo: AP \"She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,\" said Obama. He’s also annoyed that Clinton and President Obama killed Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy , whom he called one of his best friends. Malik Obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to Khadafy and others who were \"making this world a better place.\" \"I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn’t make things any better in Libya,\" he said. \"My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard.\" But what bothers him even more is the Democratic Party’s support of same-sex marriage. ‘I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart. Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.’ - Malik Obama \"I feel like a Republican now because they don’t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,\" he said. Obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage — so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12. When asked by The Post how many wives and children he has, Obama demurred. \"That’s personal,\" he said. Obama made headlines in 2011 when he married his third wife, who was still in her teens. Obama plans to trek back to the US to vote for Trump in November. Obama used to live in Maryland, where he worked for many years as an accountant and is registered to vote there, public records show. The president’s and Malik’s father, Barack Obama Sr., left Kenya in 1959 when Malik was a year old and his mother was pregnant with his sister Auma. Obama Sr. enrolled at the University of Hawaii, where he met and married the president’s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. Malik Obama didn’t meet his younger half-brother until 1985. President Obama, 54, has seven half-siblings from both sides of his family. Malik Obama, the eldest, is the director of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, a controversial Virginia charity named for his father. He says he started the charity in 2008 because he wanted to make a difference in the family’s hardscrabble village in Kenya. But the charity came under fire when The Post revealed in 2011 that it was an off-the-books operation that hadn’t registered with the state of Virginia or, as it claimed, had tax-exempt status from the IRS. Shortly after The Post report, the IRS gave its stamp of approval, leading to speculation that the president had intervened. Malik Obama seen announcing his intention to run for a Kenyan gubernatorial seat. Photo: Getty Images But Malik Obama bristles at the suggestion, saying he dug deep to pay for the electrical transformers and college scholarships that the foundation provided in Kogelo. According to its latest tax filing, the nonprofit has just $24,000 in its coffers. \"My brother didn’t help me at all,\" said Obama. \"He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn’t supported me at all.\" Lately, family ties seem to be frayed. Obama, who was best man at the president’s wedding, said he spoke to his brother a year ago and was miffed that he did nothing to help his own foray into politics when he ran for governor of the southwestern Kenyan county of Siaya in 2013. Malik Obama lost the race, and spent $20,000 of his own money on the unsuccessful campaign. \"I don’t think politics is my thing,\" he told The Post. \"Honestly, I’ll be happy when my brother is out of office, and I will finally be out of the limelight and be able to live like a human being.\" Until then, Obama wears his new GOP colors proudly; He even has a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. \"Mr. Trump is providing something new and something fresh,\" he said.\n",

Then, whisk one-half can of each concentrate with one-quarter cup of honey, a few shakes of hot sauce and salt to taste; bring to a simmer until reduced by half. Transfer the wings to a mixing bowl and toss with the glaze until coated. Serve warm.\n",

            "Topic: The Jet Engine: No Invention of the Past 85 Years Had a Greater Impact on the World\n",
            "Paragraph: 1958 Pan Am inaugurates daily Boeing 707 service across the Atlantic. Something about the human spirit compels us to go faster and farther. That’s why Howard Hughes spent 1935 risking his life flying experimental planes to break speed barriers and why he took even graver risks in 1938 to fly around the world in record time. Hughes had everything to lose—fame, fortune, beautiful girlfriends, some might say his mind—and yet he needed to know what his machines could do. In the decades that followed, crisscrossing the globe turned from a daredevil feat into a regular occurrence. The jet engine had made its way out of the labs and into daily life. These new engines were far more powerful than propellers and allowed airplanes to travel faster and farther and—crucially—to do so reliably. Hughes, Pan Am’s Juan Trippe, and others were quick to seize on the opportunity and built airline empires. The military began ordering fighter jets by the tens of thousands, and companies such as General Electric rushed to meet the demand. By the 1960s this one invention had shrunk the world. For the first time the entire surface of the planet was reachable—or at least viewable—and its wonders opened up. Food, art, leisure, commerce, and relationships were redefined. Life became richer and more hectic. Jet travel created true global citizens while also making it easier to conduct war and spread disease. And yet for all the changes the jet engine brought about, it’s remarkable how static the technology has become. Militaries have developed engines that can break the speed of sound, but the public has benefited little from such work. The Concorde came and went. Boeing spent more than $32 billion to build the 787, which is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than its predecessor but not much faster. GE is filling its engines with sensors and software in the hope of wringing another percentage point of performance here and there. Figures such as Hughes and Trippe have been replaced by low-cost airline execs like Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, who test the limits of what humans will tolerate rather than what humans can achieve. Some of this is physics, but surely some of it is complacency, too. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. The good news is that there are still people pushing boundaries. Some companies are looking at ways to revive Concorde-type jets and upgrade them with see-through cabins. Elon Musk, the SpaceX and Tesla Motors chief executive officer, wants to build an all-electric supersonic plane that can take off and land vertically. This would allow cities to locate their airports more centrally. Musk has shared his concept with Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and the trio has even talked about one-upping the idea to create passenger craft that could reach space, shaving hours off flight times. Here’s hoping there’s always a young Howard Hughes somewhere willing to give such madness a try.\n",

            "Paragraph: Cybersecurity expert Jonathan Petit claims that it’s possible to confuse a self-driving car with just $43 and a laser pointer, according to a report from Business Insider. \"Today’s self-driving cars rely on spinning sensors called lidar that can cost more than $10,000 each. But it took Jonathan Petit just $43 and a laser pointer to confuse and defeat them,\" proclaimed Business Insider’s Danielle Muoio. \"When Petit attacked the lidar, he became one of the first researchers to show how easy it is to hack self-driving cars’ sensors. He was able to trick a sensor into thinking objects were there when they weren’t, and vice versa.\" \"Anybody can go online and get access to this, buy it really quickly, and just assemble it, and there you go, you have a device that can spoof lidar,\" said Petit. \"So here, you can think that the potential consequence of an attack like this could be ‘I tried to crash you into a vehicle ahead of you because I’m telling you there is no object here. So I’m making [the sensors] blind, and now your system thinks it’s free.\" Business Insider also claimed that the exploit could be used to swerve the car by tricking its security systems, consequently throwing it off the road or moving it to a quiet place convenient for criminals. \"So now you’ve changed the path of the vehicle by doing this, that’s also an impact, which means that then the risk could be ‘I’m sending you to small street to stop you and rob you or steal the car,'\" Petit explained. \"I indeed have the unfortunate feeling that they look at security as an add-on, which is a problem. You should use this opportunity to have security by design and not doing it after thought.\" Earlier this month, Uber acknowledged that their current self-driving cars are a danger to bicycles just weeks after the California DMV demanded that the company stop testing their cars on the road without first seeking a permit. In March, a Google self-driving car collided with a bus, crumpling the car, however no passengers in either vehicle were injured.\n",

            "Paragraph: In a quiet forest in Lithuania, some of the most harrowing events of the 20th century took place. Now, 70 years later, high-tech imaging techniques have helped shine a light onto the dark – yet profoundly inspirational – story of what took place there. An international team of archaeologists has uncovered a 35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape a Nazi massacre site in Lithuania's Ponar forest, a site where 100,000 people had been killed. Researchers from Israel, Lithuania, Canada, and the US used electrical resistivity tomography to avoid disturbing the bodies in the mass graves, an imaging technique commonly used in mineral and oil exploration that shows up changes in electrical properties underground. Their imaging showed that a tunnel started in a pit, used to imprison the captives, and led to an open space in the forest. \"To find a little glimmer of hope within the dark hole of Ponar is very important as humans. The tunnel shows that even when the time was so black, there was yearning for life within that,\" Jon Seligman, an archaeologist with Israel’s antiquities authority who participated in the expedition, told Associated Press. Ponar forest, known today as Paneriai, is found 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the city center of Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital city. The Nazis invaded Lithuania in 1941, freeing them from the repressive Soviet regime that had occupied them just one year previous. While the invasion was initially welcomed, it quickly turned sour with the establishment of Jewish ghettos and mass executions. Ponar forest was chosen as an execution site because of its seclusion, its proximity to Vilnius, and its railway station. In total, around 100,000 people were slaughtered, including Russian prisoners of war, Polish intellectuals, communists, and over 70,000 Jewish people. That's 95 percent of Lithuania's Jewish population. However, Soviet troops began to advance on the area once again in 1943. In a desperate bid to cover the traces of their mass killings, the Nazis brought 80 Jewish and Soviet prisoners to Ponar forest from the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland. Under the watch of armed guards, with their legs shackled, the prisoners were forced to dig up the mass graves and burn the human remains. This group of people, known as the \"Burning Brigade\", were forced to sleep in one of the pits used for the killings. Over a period of three months, some of them secretly dug an underground tunnel from this pit using spoons and their bare hands. On April 15, 1944, the final night of Passover, 40 of the prisoners filed off their chains and fled down the tunnel. The majority were caught and subsequently killed by the Nazi guards. However, 11 managed to escape the forest and reach partisan forces, to whom they told their story. We only know about the vast majority of the horrors from Ponar forest thanks to these 11 people and their unimaginably courageous escape plan. \"As an Israeli whose family originated in Lithuania, I was reduced to tears on the discovery of the escape tunnel at Ponar,\" Seligman said in a statement. \"The exposure of the tunnel enables us to present, not only the horrors of the Holocaust, but also the yearning for life.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Carving out time for yourself during the day -- free from obligations to your work, partner or kids -- is one of life's great pleasures. And it may be even more important (and desirable) than sex. Out of 500 women polled by Celestial Seasonings, 76 percent would choose \"me time\" over sex, if they had to pick one or the other. And honestly, we can't say we're all that surprised. The survey also revealed how little time women actually have to themselves -- 42 percent of respondents reported having less than an hour of \"me time\" each day. More worryingly, 75 percent of women have told white lies, like saying they're sick or already have plans in order to work some \"me time\" into their day. Clearly, women are uncomfortable prioritizing themselves -- something we all have to get over. Whether it's vegging out in front of your favorite TV show, savoring a cup of coffee or meditating for 20 minutes, be sure to slot some alone time into your day -- and don't feel guilty about doing so. In an October 2011 blog post, Christina Norman asked: \"Why am I willing to give up my own sanity and balance to maintain everyone else's? Why does the risk of being perceived as selfish make it okay to deprive myself of what I need?\" She recommends that you put yourself \"back on the list,\" making your own well-being a top priority.

The 2009 world champion’s new two-year contract with McLaren includes an option to race in 2018, but that would probably only happen if Alonso decided to retire or go elsewhere.

            "Paragraph: A recent study published in the journal Cancer Causes and Control has revealed that Amish people have virtually no cancer within their population, and are considered the most healthy people in America. Researchers from Ohio State University originally launched a study on the Amish population to see whether rates of cancer would be higher due to their lack of conventional medical care. What they found, however, shocked them. The Amish were found to have much lower rates of cancer than the rest of the population, so researchers decided to look more closely at their lifestyle choices and diets to find out why. Most Amish people do not smoke or drink and they are typically not sexually promiscuous, leading researchers to believe that these lifestyle factors play an important role in the limited number of cancer cases. Other factors examined include the high amount of physical labor undertaken by the Amish. Most Amish people work in farming, construction, and other production jobs that require intense physical activity that keeps them healthy and in shape. While the rest of America sits in fluorescent-lit cubicles all day, the Amish work hard to produce crops, build furniture and structures, and produce useful goods, which researchers recognize contributes to their excellent health. Another important factor not specifically examined in the study is the fact that the Amish grow and raise all their own food. They employ time-tested, organic methods that provide them with healthy fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, and other untainted foods that most Americans never get. Rich in living enzymes, vitamins, and nutrients Amish food is grown and raised the way it should be, resulting in improved health. While some may ridicule their secluded lifestyle, the Amish commitment to simple, productive lives and clean, local food is benefiting their health in ways that the rest of America can only dream about. When compared to a life of sitting in office buildings all day, eating processed and genetically-modified junk food , and popping prescription medications, it becomes clear which lifestyle is truly deserving of contempt.\n",

            "Paragraph: About a quarter of the deaths from heart disease and stroke that occur yearly in the United States are preventable, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The deaths of more than 200,000 people ages 75 and younger from heart disease and stroke in 2010 could have been prevented through more effective public health measures, treatment or lifestyle changes such as improved diet and exercise, the report said. About 800,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease each year. The rate of preventable deaths was higher for men (83.7 preventable deaths per 100,000 people) than women (39.6 preventable deaths per 100,000 people). The highest rate was among black men (143.0 preventable deaths per 100,000 people). [6 Easy Ways to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables] More than half of the preventable deaths (56 percent) occurred in people younger than 65, the report said. Although the rate of preventable deaths from heart disease and stroke has declined over the last decade among people ages 65 to 74, the rate among those younger than 65 has remained unchanged, the report said. \"These findings are really striking because we're talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths that don't have to happen,\"CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a news conference. \"Many of the heart attacks and strokes that will kill people in the coming year could be prevented by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol, and stopping smoking.\" The place with highest rate of preventable deaths was the District of Columbia, with 99.6 per 100,000 people. States that also had high rates were Mississippi (95 per 100,000 people), Oklahoma (89 per 100,000 people), Tennessee (88.8 per 100,000 people) and Louisiana (87.8 per 100,000 people). The states with the lowest rates of preventable deaths were: Minnesota (36.3 per 100,000 people), Utah (36.9 per 100,000 people), Colorado (39.9 per 100,000 people), Connecticut (41.8 per 100,000 people) and New Hampshire (42.9 per 1000,000 people). In terms of heart attack and stroke deaths, \"Its unfortunate, but your longevity may be more likely to be influenced by your zip code than your genetic code,\" Frieden said. One reason for the slow decline in preventable deaths among younger age groups could be that these groups are less likely to receive screenings and early treatment for conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease and stroke. The increase in availability of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is expected to reduce the number of preventable heart attacks and strokes in younger people, Frieden said. To prevent more deaths from heart disease and stroke, health care systems can use electronic health records to identify patients who smoke or have high blood pressure and cholesterol so that doctors can follow their progress toward heart-healthy behaviors, the CDC said. Communities can promote tobacco-free areas and help ensure access to healthy foods, the CDC said. Individuals can increase their amount of daily exercise -- such as taking several brisk, 10-minute walks daily, five times a week -- and improve their diet by eating more fruits and vegetables, and fewer foods with high sodium and trans fat content.\n",

            "Paragraph: The Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition is available to purchase on Blu-Ray and Amazon Video, but when will it be available to rent? Comic book fans, even those who panned the theatrical release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice have been pining for the release of the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition. Now that it’s available to own on Blu-Ray and on Amazon Video, things have changed. As almost any critic will tell you, the version of the film shown in theaters was deeply flawed for a number of reasons. Chief among those reasons, though, was the fact that the entire film felt rushed and like there were necessary plot points that were essentially glazed over or skipped entirely. With the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition having 30 more minutes of footage and even a shiny R-rating, some of those major issues with the theatrical version have been fixed. Suffice it to say that the the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition is the far superior version of Zack Snyder’s film. However, one thing that readers have noticed is that the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition isn’t yet available to rent on Amazon Video. This obviously begs the simple question of when this better version of the movie will in fact be available to rent. The short answer is that we don’t know, but we do know that this isn’t uncommon with bigger releases. Amazon Video did the same thing with Star Wars: The Force Awakens and many others when they were released, but they eventually became available to rent on Amazon Video after a few weeks. Expect the same time frame for the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition as well would be the safest bet.\n",

The original story is below. It looks like Microsoft may have some kind of an announcement to make today. Xbox engineering lead Mike Ybarra posted a cryptic message on Twitter last night, signalling something for later today. Here is the tweet in question: It would appear that something Xbox-related will be revealed/detailed today. He posted the tweet at 10:21 PM, so 13.5 hours from then would be around 11-12 today. We'll keep our eyes on this and report back with new information when it becomes available. Ybarra is a partner director for the Xbox and Windows platforms. He heads up the development on updates for Xbox One and Windows 10 PC, though that doesn't necessarily mean that's what this tease pertains to. There are also rumors swirling around about Microsoft potentially announcing new hardware. Recently, Xbox boss Phil Spencer even said Microsoft would talk about things \"beyond\" Xbox One and Windows 10 relatively soon. Microsoft's E3 briefing in June is expected to bring even more news, on top of whatever ends up being shown today. What are you hoping to see? Let us know in the comments below.\n",

            "Paragraph: NEW YORK -- For more than two years, Lance Crowder was having severe abdominal pain and vomiting, and no local doctor could figure out why. Finally, an emergency room physician in Indianapolis had an idea. \"The first question he asked was if I was taking hot showers to find relief. When he asked me that question, I basically fell into tears because I knew he had an answer,\" Crowder said. The answer was cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS. It’s caused by heavy, long-term use of various forms of marijuana. For unclear reasons, the nausea and vomiting are relieved by hot showers or baths. \"They’ll often present to the emergency department three, four, five different times before we can sort this out,\" said Dr. Kennon Heard, an emergency room physician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. He co-authored a study showing that since 2009, when medical marijuana became widely available, emergency room visits diagnoses for CHS in two Colorado hospitals nearly doubled. In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana. \"It is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\" Heard said. \"Now we are seeing it quite frequently.\" Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don’t know about CHS, and partly because patients don’t want to admit to using a substance that’s illegal. California overwhelmingly passed a measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use Tuesday. Similar measures passed in three other states, but... CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use. That’s what happened with Crowder, who has been off all forms of marijuana for seven months. \"Now all kinds of ambition has come back. I desire so much more in life and, at 37 years old, it’s a little late to do it, but better now than never,\"he said. CHS has only been recognized for about the past decade, and nobody knows exactly how many people suffer from it. But as more states move towards the legalization of marijuana, emergency room physicians like Dr. Heard are eager to make sure both doctors and patients have CHS on their radar.\n",

            "Paragraph: When it comes to rethinking how charity works, philanthropist Peter Buffett believes millennials have a lot to give. \"Younger people have the appetite and idealism and energy for it like nobody else [to] imagine new structures,\" he told policymic.com. Buffett, a musician who's perhaps best known as Warren Buffett's son, says Gen-Yers might want to start with a cause that hits close to home. \"If I were 25 years old, I’d be first of all looking in my backyard,\" he explained to policymic. \"This is sort of a different version of 'be the change you want to see in the world.' If you really wanna do it, do it at home. Then do it at the community, the state level, and the national level. It'll grow out if it works.\" While Buffett, 55, grew up as the offspring of one of the world's richest men, he has forged his own identity in the nonprofit sector. According to the Financialist, he received $1 billion in Berkshire-Hathaway stock from his father in 2006 and used it to open the NoVo Foundation, an organization dedicated to empowering adolescent girls and ending violence against women of all ages. Buffett, who runs the foundation with his wife, Jennifer, told the Financialist that he was inspired by a speech about the importance of educating girls at the first Clinton Global Initiative in 2005. (The 2013 edition concludes Thursday in New York City). Now he wants to mobilize Gen-Yers to challenge what he sees as the status quo. Buffett stirred debate with a recent New York Times essay in which he criticized what he called \"conscience laundering,\" a term to describe when the wealthy ease their guilt of having obscene amounts of money by \"sprinkling a little around as an act of charity.\" \"There should be real risks taken,\" Buffett told policymic. \"We should be out there spending some mad money to try things that no one else will try, with the expectation that some things will fail,\" he said.\n",

But according to a new report by the design experts at Zillow Digs, paint color can impact the price a house sells for—and you might want to stay away from white paint. While it seems like white kitchens have been popping up everywhere from glossy magazines to our favorite blogs, this trend might not be as popular as you thought. Buyers who have busy lifestyles can be turned off by the idea of having to keep a bright white kitchen clean. The report, which looked at about 50,000 sold homes across the country, found that yellow kitchens, including cream and wheat yellow hues, sold for the highest amount—nearly $1,360 above expected values. Meanwhile, those with white kitchens sold for $1,400 less than their yellow counterparts. While this news is certainly surprising, we're loving the retro vibe yellow can bring to a kitchen.

            "Paragraph: In Colorado, where recreational marijuana cut its teeth in 2014, marijuana sales are already eclipsing an annualized $1 billion pace, and that's translating into a nine-figure payday for Colorado's Department of Revenue. In April, Colorado collected $13 million in cannabis taxes and fees. April's take puts the state on pace to collect $156 million in cannabis taxes and fees over the next 12 months, but Colorado's total haul from marijuana next fiscal year (which begins July 1) is likely to be a lot more than that. Why? Because marijuana sales continue to grow. In the current fiscal year, Colorado has collected $125 million in marijuana taxes and fees, up 55% from the same time last year. Colorado's success bodes well for other states considering recreational marijuana laws this fall. Voters in the Golden State will take up the issue of recreational marijuana in November; if the measure is OK'd, then taxes and fees generated by cannabis in California could dwarf Colorado's figures. California's state government reported in December that annual marijuana taxes and fees associated with recreational marijuana could total in the \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" and that they could potentially be as high as $1 billion. That tax revenue would come largely from a 15% sales tax on marijuana, but it would also come from marijuana cultivation taxes of $9.25 per ounce for dried marijuana flowers, and $2.75 per ounce for dried marijuana leaves. California could also see an uptick in state income tax revenue as black-market marijuana producers and sellers come out of the shadows. The state's ramp in marijuana tax revenue could be faster than Colorado's, too. California pioneered medical marijuana laws in the 1990s, so there are nearly 1,000 medical marijuana dispensaries already open for business. Applications for recreational marijuana licenses by medical marijuana dispensaries in California will get preference, so many of these shops could begin serving customers quickly. The state shouldn't have difficulty getting enough supply to meet demand, either. California's marijuana culture is well established and California is by far the biggest indoor and outdoor producer of marijuana in the country. California grows four times more marijuana every year than Tennessee, the second highest-producing state. Most of that marijuana is grown in a thinly populated area in the northern part of the state called the Emerald Triangle. The Emerald Triangle is thought to be the largest marijuana-producing area in both the U.S. and the world. Legalizing cannabis could also have a big and positive impact on California tourism. A Google search of Colorado marijuana tours yields 435,000 results, and in December, the Denver Post reported that Colorado's my420tours handles between 120 and 200 tourists per week. A survey conducted last year by Denver's Department of Tourism found that 22% of Colorado tourists said marijuana was \"extremely influential\" in planning their trips to visit the state. California's Napa Valley hosts more than 3 million wine lovers every year, and those visitors spend more than $1.6 billion annually in the region. Could tourism in the Emerald Triangle eclipse those figures? Only time will tell. But if it does, then marijuana's impact on California's coffers may extend far beyond the marijuana taxes and fees the state collects.

            "Topic: Parents of successful kids have these 12 things in common\n",
            "Paragraph: Good parents want their kids to stay out of trouble, do well in school, and go on to do awesome things as adults. And while there isn't a set recipe for raising successful children, psychology research has pointed to a handful of factors that predict success. Unsurprisingly, much of it comes down to the parents. Here's what parents of successful kids have in common: They make their kids do chores \"If kids aren't doing the dishes, it means someone else is doing that for them,\" Julie Lythcott-Haims, former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of \"How to Raise an Adult\" said during a TED Talks Live event.  \"And so they're absolved of not only the work, but of learning that work has to be done and that each one of us must contribute for the betterment of the whole,\" she said.  Lythcott-Haims believes kids raised on chores go on to become employees who collaborate well with their coworkers, are more empathetic because they know firsthand what struggling looks like, and are able to take on tasks independently.   She bases this on the Harvard Grant Study, the longest longitudinal study ever conducted. \"By making them do chores — taking out the garbage, doing their own laundry — they realize I have to do the work of life in order to be part of life,\" she tells Tech Insider. They teach their kids social skills Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing. \"This study shows that helping children develop social and emotional skills is one of the most important things we can do to prepare them for a healthy future,\" said Kristin Schubert, program director at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funded the research, in a release. \"From an early age, these skills can determine whether a child goes to college or prison, and whether they end up employed or addicted.\" They have high expectations Using data from a national survey of 6,600 children born in 2001, University of California at Los Angeles professor Neal Halfon and his colleagues discovered that the expectations parents hold for their kids have a huge effect on attainment.  \"Parents who saw college in their child's future seemed to manage their child toward that goal irrespective of their income and other assets,\" he said in a statement. The finding came out in standardized tests: 57% of the kids who did the worst were expected to attend college by their parents, while 96% of the kids who did the best were expected to go to college. That parents should keep their expectations high falls in line with another psych finding — the Pygmalion effect, which states \"that what one person expects of another can come to serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy\" — as well as what some teachers told Business Insider was most important for a child's success. They've attained higher educational levels A 2014 study lead by University of Michigan psychologist Sandra Tang found that mothers who finished high school or college were more likely to raise kids that did the same.  Pulling from a group of over 14,000 children who entered kindergarten in 1998 to 2007, the study found that children born to teen moms (18 years old or younger) were less likely to finish high school or go to college than their counterparts.  Aspiration is at least partially responsible. In a 2009 longitudinal study of 856 people in semirural New York, Bowling Green State University psychologist Eric Dubow found that \"parents' educational level when the child was 8 years old significantly predicted educational and occupational success for the child 40 years later.\" They teach their kids math early on A 2007 meta-analysis of 35,000 preschoolers across the US, Canada, and England found that developing math skills early can turn into a huge advantage. \"The paramount importance of early math skills — of beginning school with a knowledge of numbers, number order, and other rudimentary math concepts — is one of the puzzles coming out of the study,\" coauthor and Northwestern University researcher Greg Duncan said in a press release. \"Mastery of early math skills predicts not only future math achievement, it also predicts future reading achievement.\" They develop a relationship with their kids A 2014 study of 243 people born into poverty found that children who received \"sensitive caregiving\" in their first three years not only did better in academic tests in childhood, but had healthier relationships and greater academic attainment in their 30s.  As reported on PsyBlog, parents who are sensitive caregivers \"respond to their child's signals promptly and appropriately\" and \"provide a secure base\" for children to explore the world. \"This suggests that investments in early parent-child relationships may result in long-term returns that accumulate across individuals' lives,\"coauthor and University of Minnesota psychologist Lee Raby said in an interview. They're less stressed According to recent research cited by Brigid Schulte at The Washington Post, the number of hours that moms spend with kids between ages 3 and 11 does little to predict the child's behavior, well-being, or achievement.  What's more, the \"intensive mothering\" or \"helicopter parenting\" approach can backfire.  \"Mothers' stress, especially when mothers are stressed because of the juggling with work and trying to find time with kids, that may actually be affecting their kids poorly,\" study coauthor and Bowling Green State University sociologist Kei Nomaguchi told The Post. Emotional contagion — or the psychological phenomenon where people \"catch\" feelings from one another like they would a cold — helps explain why. Research shows that if your friend is happy, that brightness will infect you if she's sad, that gloominess will transfer as well. So if a parent is exhausted or frustrated, that emotional state could transfer to the kids.  The moms work outside the home According to research out of Harvard Business School, there are significant benefits for children growing up with mothers who work outside the home. The study found daughters of working mothers went to school longer, were more likely to have a job in a supervisory role, and earned more money — 23% more compared to their peers who were raised by stay-at-home mothers. The sons of working mothers also tended to pitch in more on household chores and childcare, the study found — they spent seven-and-a-half more hours a week on childcare and 25 more minutes on housework. \"Role modeling is a way of signaling what's appropriate in terms of how you behave, what you do, the activities you engage in, and what you believe,\" the study's lead author, Harvard Business School professor Kathleen L. McGinn, told Business Insider. \"There are very few things, that we know of, that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother,\" she told Working Knowledge. They have a higher socioeconomic status Tragically, one-fifth of American children grow up in poverty, a situation that severely limits their potential. It's getting more extreme. According to Stanford University researcher Sean Reardon, the achievement gap between high- and low-income families \"is roughly 30% to 40% larger among children born in 2001 than among those born 25 years earlier.\"  As \"Drive\" author Dan Pink has noted, the higher the income for the parents, the higher the SAT scores for the kids.  \"Absent comprehensive and expensive interventions, socioeconomic status is what drives much of educational attainment and performance,\"he wrote. They teach 'grit' In 2013, University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth won a MacArthur \"genius\" grant for her uncovering of a powerful, success-driving personality trait called grit.  Defined as a \"tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals,\" her research has correlated grit with educational attainment, grade-point average in Ivy League undergrads, retention in West Point cadets, and rank in the US National Spelling Bee.  It's about teaching kids to imagine — and commit — to a future they want to create.  They give their kids bias-proof names A host of research shows just how much your name can affect your lifetime success, from your hireability to your spending habits. Career-wise, people with names that are common and easy to pronounce, for example, have been found to have more success. They understand the importance of good nutrition and eating habits Successful people recognize that good eating habits can help you focus and be productive throughout the day. As Tech Insider previously reported, Dr. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a family and children's clinical psychologist and author of books like \"The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age,\" told Slate that developing food habits in kids that are both mentally and physically healthy requires involvement from parents. To help their kids develop a sense of body acceptance and a body-positive self-image, she says parents need to role model good attitudes about their own and others' bodies, healthy eating habits of their own, and a positive attitude about food.\n",

It also announced a brand new Quake game during the press conference. Despite all this, one thing that the fans missed during the press conference was the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6. Most of the fans expected the game to be announced during the event owing to the fact that Skyrim protagonist Dragonborn’s image was featured in Bethesda’s E3 promo images. However, even though the game was not announced during the event, Bethesda boss Todd Howard confirmed that the game is in works in his own special way. Speaking to Geoff Keighley during a \"Youtube Live at E3\" interview, Howard let the cat out of the bag: It’s good in these moments to tell our fans, ‘Yes, of course we are [making The Elder Scrolls 6]. It’s something we love.’ But it is–you know, I have to be careful what I say–it’s a very long way off.\" He added, \"I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, ‘That sounds like you don’t even have the technology–how long is that going to take?\" Howard also said they are working on two more projects which will be revealed before The Elder Scrolls 6, which means the latter won’t be coming anytime soon. Vice President of PR and Marketing at Bethesda, Pete Hines, tweeted that he jokes with Todd Howard The Elder Scrolls 6 will release on 22/22/22. He also added that \"our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out.\" I often kid Todd that release date for TES 6 will be 22/22/22. Our robot overlords will change our calendar system by the time it comes out. — Pete Hines (@DCDeacon) June 13, 2016 Although this is not a good news for the fans of the franchise, they’ll still have some other Elder Scrolls content to indulge in. Bethesda announced that there is going to be a big update in The Elder Scrolls Online and The Elder Scrolls: Legends will be releasing in PC and mobile. To add to this, an improved version of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim called Skyrim: Special Edition is also out now for everyone to enjoy and play.\n",

            "Paragraph: If your whisk is in the dishwasher or you can’t stand forking out money for a cooking utensil you’ll only pull out once a year, try these easy swaps with products you have on hand. You need: A whisk Sub in: Two forks. Whisks add in air when you’re blending ingredients such as eggs and whipping cream. If you don’t have a whisk handy, you can achieve the same effect by taping together two forks. Find forks with the same-sized handles and tines. Place one on top of the other so that their tines overlap. Create some space between the two eating implements by putting a small piece of folded paper towel between the upper parts of their handles—this will help aerate your mixture. Tape the handles and paper towel together, then whisk away. Tip: Avoid using this makeshift whisk on non-stick pans the forks can damage the lining. These tricks can help you make perfect eggs every time. You need: A meat mallet Sub in: A heavy saucepan. Meat mallets flatten foods like chicken breasts so that they cook evenly. The pressure also tenderizes meat. If you don’t own a mallet—how many people do?—use a sauté pan to pound meat to the desired thickness. Sandwich the meat first in plastic wrap to avoid splatters and to keep the meat clean. Tip: You can also flatten meat with a rolling pin. Looking for more kitchen tricks? Your salt shaker has many brilliant uses you’ve never thought of. You need: A steamer basket Sub in: Aluminum foil and a heat-proof plate. The purpose of these baskets is to place food over steam without letting water touch it. For a replacement, crumple some tin foil into three large balls (see a visual how-to at noshon.it). Place them in a triangle pattern at the bottom of a large pot. Top them with a heat-proof plate, like a pie plate, that’s smaller than the pot. Add water to just beneath the plate, then put flat items such as spinach, dumplings or salmon on top of the plate. Once the water comes to a simmer, cover the pot. Tip: For food with a lot of volume, like broccoli, use a colander instead of aluminum foil. You need: A jar opener Sub in: Rubber bands. You’re trying to cook dinner when you realize that the container of pasta sauce is stuck tight—and it had never occurred to you buy a jar opener. To get a better grip on a tight or slippery lid, wrap its edge with a rubber band (thicker ones seem to work better). Hold the jar with one hand and twist the lid with the other. Voila! The lid opens easily. Tip: You can improve your grip even more by putting an additional rubber band around the center of the jar and grasping the container there. You’ll wish you’d always known these 25 brilliant kitchen shortcuts. You need: A grater Sub in: A food processor. Grater nowhere to be found? To grate hard and semi-hard cheeses, spray non-stick cooking spray on the blades of a food processor. Dice the cheese into small pieces, add them to the processor, close the lid and pulse for two to three seconds or until you’re satisfied with the result. Tip: For hard vegetables, such as zucchini and carrots, peel and cut up the veggies, then use the grater blade on your food processor and pulse. You need: A rolling pin Sub in: A vodka or wine bottle. If you only bake pies once or twice a year, why fill up scarce kitchen space with a rolling pin when a vodka or wine bottle can just as easily do the trick? Cover the bottles with plastic cling wrap to prevent sticking, then use the bottles exactly as you would a roller. Tip: If you freeze a vodka bottle beforehand, the coolness of your \"rolling pin\" will help the fat in your pie crust dough stay solid, which in turn yields a flakier crust. Here’s what else you can do with leftover wine bottles. You need: A colander Sub in: An aluminum pie tin. If you have to strain pasta or vegetables but find yourself without a colander, poke holes in a disposable aluminum pie tin and place the food inside to strain. Tip: No pie tin? Simply add holes to a sheet of aluminum foil, securely wrap it over your pot and carefully strain the food. You need: A bottle opener Sub in: A large spoon. Want to quoff a beer or soda, but the bottle opener is MIA? Try this: Hold the bottle by its neck in one hand and a large spoon in your other one. Put the front tip of the spoon under the cap, then lift up the cap until it pops open, as Wikihow demonstrates. Tip: You can also use another bottle as an opener. Hold one bottle upside down and use its lid to wedge off the other bottle’s cap. If you’re not careful, however, you may remove the wrong cap and end up with a giant spill. You need: A sifter Sub in: A metal sieve. Sifting fluffs up flour and mixes dry ingredients together. For a good substitute, hold a metal strainer (fine-meshed ones are best) over a bowl with one hand. Put the ingredients in the strainer and use your other hand to gently tap the sides so that the ingredients slowly sift through the holes. Tip: You can also use a whisk to blend ingredients together but the flour won’t get as light as it would with a sifter or sieve.\n",

            "Paragraph: Good old tap water will go a long way toward washing pesticide residues off your fruit and vegetables, but \"getting it down to zero is not feasible, ever,\" said Dave Stone, a toxicologist who is the director of theNational Pesticide Information Center, a cooperative effort between Oregon State University and the Environmental Protection Agency. While washing can reduce pesticide residues on the surface, it cannot eliminate pesticides that are absorbed by the roots into the very tissue of the fruit or vegetable. Scrubbing with a vegetable brush helps, Dr. Stone said, but using a store-bought veggie wash might not: A 2000 study by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station found that rinsing lettuce, strawberries and tomatoes under tap water for 60 seconds worked just as well as using a commercial vegetable wash to significantly reduce pesticide residues. Using a veggie wash might even backfire, Dr. Stone said, because detergent residue could be added to fruits with porous outer layers. The best way to wash is to place the fruit or vegetable in a colander and run water over it, rather than just dunk it in a bowl. \"The force of the running water will drive off residues,\" Dr. Stone said. Peeling also helps get rid of pesticide residues in the skin. The Environmental Working Group’s so-called Dirty Dozen and the Consumer Reports Always Buy Organic list, both of which are based on data from the federal Department of Agriculture, which tests fruits and vegetables after they have been washed, include items deemed to have relatively higher pesticide loads. Both lists include strawberries, nectarines and American-grown apples. If you’re considering buying organic, you might put these items at the top of your list.\n",

            "Paragraph: In a world overrun by crazy restrictive diets, miserable juice plans, and weight loss pills, it's easy to forget about one simple concept: portion control. But new research shows that making this one change—paying more attention to how much you eat rather than what you eat—is the gold standard if you want to lose weight. In fact, scientists at Cambridge University in the UK have found that cutting back on serving size alone can help Americans eat an average of 527 fewer calories per day, resulting in a weight loss of about one pound per week.  Researchers crunched the numbers on more than 60 studies on food intake and found that increasing portion sizes have caused us all to eat more, regardless of our gender, hunger levels, how thin or fat we are, or our amount of self-reported willpower. In particular, they found that supersized portions can add more than 500 calories to each of our plates every day, which has only helped to make us fatter and fatter.  \"The message is that, however it happens, reducing the amounts of food that end up in front of us in the first place is key [to weight loss],\" says Gareth Hollands, PhD, senior research associate at Cambridge University School of Clinical Medicine and coauthor of the paper. But there's one big problem: The first and only step of portion control—eat less—is notoriously difficult to do. So how do you accomplish the feat? Here are the top meal-reshaping, fat-blasting tips from Lisa Young, PhD, author of The Portion Teller. 1. Forget about portions when you eat out, because restaurants are notorious for serving oversize meals. Resolve before you even walk into a restaurant to split an entrée, supplementing with a salad or veggie side dish. Avoid all-you-can-eat deals, and wait to have your cocktail until after your meal, since alcohol is proven to trigger overeating. 2. Downsize your plates and glasses to smaller tableware, which will go a long way in reducing how much food ends up on your plate.  3. Most of us are serving ourselves too much food without even realizing it. Learn what an appropriate portion size looks like by using this handy visual guide.  4. Fill half your plate with low-calorie, fiber-rich fruits and veggies that aren't dripping in butter or cream sauce (herbs and spices are your friends!), using one-quarter of your plate for a lean protein and the final quarter for a whole grain like brown rice. (Lose up to 15 pounds WITHOUT dieting with Eat Clean to Get Lean, our 21-day clean-eating meal plan.) 5. Plate your meal in the kitchen and keep serving dishes there so that you're forced to get up for seconds rather than simply reaching across the table.\n",

            "Paragraph: Fast-food chains have watched their sales growth drop off a cliff Executives advance plenty of reasons for the slowdown — or, in the case of some brands, the outright decline in sales. Some blame politics , others blame the oil crash , and so on. The real reason may be a bit simpler: It's getting cheaper for Americans to eat at home. The price of food at grocery stores has actually been on the decline since the end of 2015, based on the Consumer Price Index for food at home. In fact, in July (the most recent data available), the cost of food at home declined 1.55% from the same month a year ago. On the other hand, the cost of food away from home — what you pay at restaurants — is still on the rise. In July, prices for food away from home rose 2.79% from same month last year. According to David Palmer at RBC Capital Markets, this is also a good thing for fast-food restaurants , as ingredient prices have fallen for them, lowering costs and boosting profit margins. But the drop in food prices is also hurting sales. \"Food cost relief has been a boon to restaurant-level margins in 2016, with many fast food operators generating their best gross margins since 2012,\" Palmer wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \"That said, lower food costs have historically been a constraint to industry sales and food deflation should last through at least 2Q17.\" It appears that as long as grocery bills are shrinking, Americans are going to make their burgers instead of buying them\n",

            "Paragraph: There's no denying that Super Smash Bros 4 on the 3DS is a great game. The release date brought a fighter with many characters, lots of gameplay modes and frantic item-throwing fun. But nothing's perfect -- in the case of Smash Bros 4, the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue. Whether it be local multiplayer in Sm4sh or online, the game stutters early and often. The game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our Smash Bros 4 fights always take place in Lag City. We got a hint of this when we did our review for SSB43DS but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in Japan. Now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. Boy were we wrong. Now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with Louis CK . The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it. (Smash bros) Super Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer We began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable. During our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home wifi network, Smash Bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). We're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. Without the ability to hit the Home Button we were forced to turn it off. On to For Glory then. (Smash Bros) For Glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. Though similar to For Fun, the lag was consistent. If you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free. (Smash Bros) SSB4: Local Multiplayer Playing Smash with our Bros in person was a different story. For some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. I and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing Super Smash Bros 4. We played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. In a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. The same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon Smash session. 5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. Having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. Despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds. In a 2nd round of local Smash Bros 4 multiplayer \"testing\" (read: playing in the office, for science!) 2 players was much easier on the system. The most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd CPU player was thrown in the mix. Surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag. (Smash Bros) SSB4 Online Lag Fixes And Placebos Having this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like Super Smash Bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. Though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. The sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying. So guys, found out I had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. #smashbros pic.twitter.com/wd5lW2PQnS — Raymond Lancione (@raylancione) October 7, 2014 If anyone's having #SmashBros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. — It was me, Milu! (@miluette) October 6, 2014 \"Connectivity can depend heavily on location so I really don’t know what to say. At the very least, we’ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. During multi-player, you’re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it’s due to the connection speed. If you play when it’s laggy, then the person you’re playing with will experience the same lag, so it’s best to play when the connection is clear. During development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. It’s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. Free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either.\" (Wordpress) The Part Where I Complain About The 3DS Hardware Something tells me the new 3DS was made because the current one can't handle Super Smash Bros. This is the first time a Smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . The 3DS charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of Nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. Not to mention OG 3DS owners not getting access to the beloved C-stick. Nintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. But what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? Would the PS Vita have these lag issues? Could the Ice Climbers have part of Smash Bros for the iPhone ? (Not that you could ever seriously play Smash on a smartphone, but not the point). Though all in all, Smash players now that the 3DS version isn't the real experience. Having the game with us at all times is nice, but the real showdowns will take place on the Wii U -- in HD and with GameCube controllers in hand. If Nintendo can bring a smooth experience to the full edition of Super Smash Bros 4, fans may be likely to forgive the gaming company. Are you experiencing lag in your online battles in Smash Bros 4? Let us know your experiences below!\n",

            "Paragraph: Photo The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has played a central role in carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State in the Middle East. Credit Anne-Christine Poujoulat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images An aircraft carrier can be a very handy tool, especially when trouble flares up far from a friendly military base. Just ask the Pentagon, which has 10 big Nimitz-class supercarriers that it uses around the world to protect air and sea lanes and to mount airstrikes. There’s generally at least one of them stationed near the Middle East at all times. So, as other countries join in military action against extremists in the world’s hot spots, can’t they send their own carriers into action? Well, they could if they had any. But, aside from the 10 American giants, there’s currently only one big carrier in the whole world that can handle such a job — and it doesn’t belong to Britain, Russia or even China. Though it is nuclear-powered, the Charles de Gaulle isn’t quite a supercarrier — it’s shorter and much lighter, and doesn’t pack the same punch. But neither does it rate down among the small escort carriers and helicopter carriers that a number of navies employ. It is considered a medium-size fleet carrier, and these days, it has that category practically to itself. Russia has the Admiral Kuznetsov, but that ship has been plagued with mechanical problems and doesn’t leave port often. A partially completed sister carrier was sold to China, but it has yet to complete trials. India has an older Russian castoff that rarely sails, and Brazil’s 50-year-old French-built fleet carrier, the São Paulo, is being refitted. Britain, which got out of the fleet carrier game years ago for cost reasons, is getting back in: A newly built carrier, which is larger than the Charles de Gaulle, is expected to be commissioned next year. Another will follow several years after that.\n",

            "Paragraph: I have quite an imagination – yet I’d struggle to dream up an Alpine hotel any more wonderful than Les Airelles. It’s officially one of the best hotels in France, one of only 16 that’s been awarded a ‘palace’ rating by the Ministry of Tourism for 'enhancing the image of the country' - and my girlfriend and I are discovering that this is no meaningless accolade. Its location alone is the stuff of skiers’ fantasies, nestled among trees next to a tiny winding run - Jardin Alpin - in Courchevel 1850. By all accounts, it’s one of the most prestigious plots of land anywhere in Europe. This is the resort, after all, where billionaires and princes and princesses come to play in the snow - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge holidayed here last season – and Les Airelles is in one of the best spots. The building is a picturesque grand chalet inspired by Bavarian baroque architecture with 37 rooms and 14 suites. It’s the stuff of fairytales from the outside and inside. An ornate blushed-rose facade with prancing deer motifs and curved wooden balconies hides a lavish 19th-century Alpine-style interior. Done badly, and this kind of aesthetic can be sickly sweet and tacky. But the interior designers used at Les Airelles clearly know their art. The décor is intricate, elegant and classy, with beautiful antique furniture and lashings of warm wood. The downstairs bar contains epic sofas, the plumpest of cushions, scattered liberally – and a couple of massive open fires.  Grand, yet cosy. A combination that takes real skill to achieve. The old-fashioned Alpine theme – which has a whiff of the Austro-Hungarian about it - is carried right through to the staff uniforms - traditional French dresses for the ladies and cropped capri trousers with long socks, ankle boots and berets for the men. Our bedroom is one of the suites, with a living room area, impossibly comfy king-sized bed and a rain-shower that creates a sort of mini-monsoon.  Just tremendous. And the toiletries? All by Hermes and Cellcosmet. The squeal of delight from the girlfriend tells me they are top class. A tremendous option for a mountainside lunch at Courchevel 1850 is Le Chalet de Pierres - which is part of the group that owns Les Airelles, the LOV Hotel Collection. It's a huge cut above most ski resort restaurants and offers genuinely gourmet food.  I'm more impressed by the brace of flat-screens – one in the bedroom and one in the living room – that both come with Apple TV. And the view?  Pine trees and the resort's peaks. But also to a neighbouring palace-rated hotel. It's Courchevel, after all. It has three hotels with this accolade. The facilities at Les Airelles include a pool in the basement, along with a stunning spa, hammam, sauna, outdoor Jacuzzi and even a barber’s. It's worth dwelling on the pool for a moment, though, because it's simply stunning.  The tiling is an exquisite mosaic and the light from underwater spotlights dances off it in a most beguiling way. Ok, so a lot of hotels have nice pools. But the Rolex clock above this one is an extra reminder that you're in the classiest of establishments. The dining options, meanwhile, include a two-Michelin-starred restaurant (what else?) - Pierre Gagnaire. Here the cooking is sheer artistry. We give it a whirl and our taste buds are treated to sirloin steak of wagyu beef, presse of poultry and clams with cornes of d'abondance mushrooms. We're offered champagne as an aperitif – Pommery or Cristal. We go the way of the rappers here. Children are well-catered for, too, at Les Airelles. There’s a mini ice rink complete with cute model penguins they can hold on to and an amazing games room containing a mini climbable castle, Xbox Ones, PlayStations, cinema area and a thrilling Star Wars games pod. What makes the hotel so special, however, is the way the service just purrs. For instance, every member of staff, from the cleaners to the bell hops, offers a polite ‘bonjour monsieur/bonjour madam' to guests as they pass and napkins are replaced mid-way through breakfast if the one in use is looking a bit too ruffled (the fresh one is placed on the table by way of silver tongs). But perhaps it’s best summed up by the occasion when the ski boot-room attendant notices one morning that my girlfriend had arrived with just socks on her feet. When she returns after a day on the slopes, a pair of hotel slippers are waiting for her to wear for the journey back to the bedroom. It’s a hotel that doesn’t put a foot wrong (though, gasp, the taps in one of our bedroom sinks is mislabelled). The downside? Deep pockets are needed, with the cheapest room costing around 1,100 euros (£950/$1,100) a night. But if you can afford it, you’ll find yourself cocooned in the hotel of my dreams. And probably yours.  Rooms at Les Airelles, part of the LOV Hotel Collection, start from €1,100 per night on a half-board basis. For more information visit www.airelles.fr or phone +33 (0) 4 79 00 38 38. Train fares from London to Moutiers (a short drive from Courchevel) by Eurostar and TGV start at £111 standard class return.

            "Paragraph: (ANTIMEDIA) Wilmington, DE — As it turns out, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share something pertinent in common, after all — a tax haven cozily nested inside the United States. This brick-and-mortar, nondescript two-story building in Wilmington, Delaware would be awfully crowded if its registered occupants — 285,000 companies — actually resided there. What’s come to be known as the \"Delaware loophole\" — the unassuming building at 1209 North Orange Street — has become, as the Guardian described, \"famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax.\" We're revolutionizing the news industry, but we need your help! Click here to get started. Reportedly dozens of Fortune 500 companies — Coca-Cola, Walmart, American Airlines, and Apple, to name a few — use Delaware’s strict corporate secrecy laws and legal tax loopholes by registering the North Orange Street address for official business. \"Big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels, and worse — all have turned up at the Delaware address in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks,\" the New York Times’ Leslie Wayne described in 2012. \"It’s easy to set up shell companies here, no questions asked.\" While the legitimacy of taxes as a concept may be up to personal interpretation, what matters in Clinton’s use of the so-called Delaware loophole, in particular, is her constant harping on the need for corporations and elite individuals to pay their fair share. In other words, Clinton’s employment of North Orange Street amounts to a telling, Do As I Say, Not As I Do. And, as the Guardian notes, both of \"the leading candidates for president – Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump – have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why.\" As Rupert Neate explained for the Guardian, being registered in the tiny state allows \"companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of state.\" In fact, some have claimed — all revelations of Panamanian documents aside — the use of tax-friendly locations inside the U.S. makes it the biggest tax haven in the world, with Delaware, alone, costing other states some $9 billion in lost taxes over the past decade. Clinton has repeatedly touted the needs for tax transparency and to shut down foreign havens with similar loopholes. \"Some of you may have just heard about these disclosures about outrageous tax havens and loopholes and superrich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere,\" Clinton told the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO annual Constitutional Convention earlier this month. \"We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America.\" Oh, the irony. According to Neate, a Clinton spokesman explained, \"ZFS [Holdings, LLC] was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.\" Why, if what the spokesman claims to be true, would Clinton bother using an address in Delaware? Of the 515 companies Trump officially registered with the Federal Election Commission, \"We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware,\" the billionaire told the Guardian, \"meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks. I don’t feel guilty at all, OK?\" Delaware’s incredibly business-friendly structure that allows for such a crowded address is completely legal, though the ability to create shell corporations lends to shady dealings and is \"a magnet ... which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes,\" as a report by the Institute on Taxation and Foreign Policy has described. Still, Clinton’s constant moralizing on tax transparency — and her spokesperson’s claims she hasn’t benefited from the North Orange Street address — proves, yet again, her stances offer little in the way of a solid foundation.

            "Paragraph: There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student Brock Turner , following his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. A compelling, haunting description by the victim of her experience has been read millions of times online after being released by the district attorney – its power so at odds with the court’s apparent leniency. Around the world outraged headlines have referred to the \"Brock Turner rape case\". And that’s quite accurate – he was originally charged with rape of an intoxicated person and rape of an unconscious person. But those indictments were dropped at a preliminary hearing, reportedly after prosecutors received the results of DNA testing. As such, the case continued on the basis of ‘lesser’ charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person; penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object; and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. In essence, Californian state law defines rape as penetration by the penis. Since that did not occur Turner is a criminal, a sex offender – but he isn’t, according to the law, a rapist.   Play Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00  Fullscreen Playback Rate 1  Subtitles subtitles off  Captions captions settings captions settings captions off  Chapters Chapters  Mute 00:00  Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done  Close Share Video: Share via:  Facebook  Google+  Twitter  tumblr  Pinterest  LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code:  Restart ‘Heroic’ Swedish student who stopped Stanford rape describes what he saw It is notable that America’s Federal Bureau of Investigations defines rape differently, as \"penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim\". That reflects the trend in state laws, although there remains considerable variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness. California is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise ‘object penetration’ to a lesser degree than penile penetration. Even so, Turner’s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison. Even putting aside the precise definition of his conviction, it is no wonder that his six month sentence has received such criticism. Under English law, Turner wouldn’t be classified as a rapist either. As in California, the offence of rape is strictly confined to a man penetrating another person with his penis in the absence of consent. That is why a woman cannot be convicted of rape except in circumstances where she assists a man to commit the crime.  Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life    19 show all   Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life   1/19 Afghanistan Recommendation: I urge the Government of Afghanistan to adopt legislative reforms to ensure that sexual violence offences are not conflated with adultery or \"morality crimes\" and to establish infrastructure for the delivery of protection, health and le gal services to survivors.

I encourage the authorities to implement Law 1719 and continue to prosecute cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict to ensure that survivors receive justice and receive reparations. Conflict-related sexual violence should continue to be addressed in the Havana peace talks, as well as in the resulting accords and transitional justice mechanisms. Particular attention should be paid to groups that face additional barriers to justice such as ethnic minorities, women in rural areas, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and women abused within the ranks of armed groups. I encourage the Government to scale up its protection measures and share its good practices with other conflict-affected countries 4/19 Congo Recommendation: I urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ensure full implementation of the armed forces action plan against sexual violence, to systematically bring perpetrators to justice and to deliver reparations to victims, including payment of outstanding compensation awards. I call on donors and the United Nations system to support the Government in its efforts and to pay increased attention to neglected areas, including unregulated mining regions 5/19 Iraq Recommendation: I commend the Government of Iraq for its national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and urge its swift implementation, including by training its security forces to ensur e respect for women’s rights. Programmes to support the social reintegration of women and girls released from captivity by ISIL are urgently needed, as is community-based medical and psychological care. The capacity of the United Nations system should be enhanced through the deployment of Women’s Protection Advisers or equivalent specialists 6/19 Libya Recommendation: I urge the national authorities in Libya to implement Decree No. 119 and Resolution 904 of 2014 to ensure redress for all victims, including those affected by the current conflict, through the establishment of multisectoral services and the adoption of legislation to categorically prohibit sexual violence 7/19 Mali Recommendation: I urge the Government of Mali, with support from United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, to develop a comprehensive national strategy to combat sexual and gender-based violence and to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers so that services can reach remote areas. I further call on all parties to ensure that conflict-related sexual violence is addressed in the inter-Malian dialogue and that perpetrators of sexual violence do not benefit from amnesty or early release 8/19 Myanmar Recommendation: I urge the Government of Myanmar to continue with its reform agenda and, in the process, take practical and timely actions to protect and support survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and to ensure that security personnel accused of such crimes are prosecuted. Sexual violence should be an element in all ceasefire and peace negotiations, excluded from the scope of amnesty provisions and addressed in transitional justice processes. It is critical that women be able to participate consistently in and influence these processes 9/19 Somalia Recommendation: I reiterate my call to the Federal Government of Somalia to implement the commitments made under the joint communiqué of 7 May 2013 and its national action plan to combat sexual violence in conflict, including specific plans for the army and the police. I encourage the adoption of a sexual offences bill as a matter of priority 10/19 South Sudan Recommendation: I urge the parties to the conflict in South Sudan to adopt action plans to implement the commitments made under their respective communiqués. I call upon the Government of South Sudan to address the negative impact of customary law on women’s rights and to reflect international human rights standards in national law. I also encourage the African Union to make public and act upon the report of its Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan 11/19 Sudan (Darfur) Recommendation: I call upon the Government of the Sudan to grant the United Nations and its humanitarian partners unfettered access for monitoring and the provision of assistance to people in need in Darfur. Given that there has been grave concern over sexual violence in Darfur for more than a decade, I encourage the Government to engage with my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict to develop a framework of cooperation to address the issue comprehensively 12/19 Syria Recommendation: I acknowledge the Government’s invitation to my Special Representative to visit the Syrian Arab Republic and call upon the authorities, in the context of such a visit, to agree on specific measures to prevent sexual violence, including by members of the security forces. I condemn the use of sexual violence by ISIL and all other parties listed in the annex to the present report and call on them to cease such violations immediately and allow unfettered access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance 13/19 Yemen Recommendation: I urge the authorities in Yemen to undertake legislative reform as a basis for addressing impunity for sexual violence, ensuring the provision of services for survivors and aligning the minimum legal age of marriage with international standards. I further call on the authorities to engage with local community and faithbased leaders to address sexual and gender-based violence and discriminatory social norms 14/19 Bosnia and Herzegovina Recommendation: I urge the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to harmonize legislation and policies so that the rights of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence to reparations are consistently recognized and to allocate a specific budget for this purpose. I further call upon the authorities to protect and support survivors participating in judicial proceedings through, inter alia, referrals to free legal aid, psychosocial and health services, as well as economic empowerment programmes 15/19 Ivory Coast Recommendation: I urge the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to ensure the effective implementation of its national strategy to combat gender-based violence and the action plan for FRCI, and call on the international community to support these efforts. It is critical to accelerate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and strengthen law enforcement to ensure that ex-combatants who have been reintegrated into the transport sector do not pose a risk to women and girls who are reliant on those services. The Government and the international community must provide monitoring and awareness-raising to mitigate the possibility of a recurrence of sexual violence in the context of the presidential elections to be held in October 2015 16/19 Liberia Recommendation: I call on the Government of Liberia to continue its critical efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence including through the United Nations-Government of Liberia Joint Programme, and in the context of recovery from the Ebola virus epidemic 17/19 Nepal Recommendation: I encourage the Government to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence are recognized under the law as \"conflict victims\", which will enable them to access services, judicial remedies and reparations. I further call on all parties involved in the transitional justice process to ensure that the rights and needs o f survivors of sexual violence are addressed in institutional reforms and that these crimes are excluded from amnesties and statutes of limitations 18/19 Sri Lanka Recommendation: I call upon the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of sexual violence, including against national armed and security forces, and to provide multisectoral services for survivors, including reparations and economic empowerment programmes for women at risk, including war widows and female heads of household 19/19 Nigeria Recommendation: I encourage the Government to implement its national action plan on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) to ensure that women’s protection concerns are mainstreamed throughout its security operations. I also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas Whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course. It is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded. We have – for the most part – moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of ‘phallo-centric’ rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed. Brock Turner’s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined – and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing – out into the open. The tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman. Read the Stanford victim's full impact statement Your honor, If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly. You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today. On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself \"big mama\", because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college. The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence. Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me. I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said \"Rape Victim\" and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions. After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else. On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes. My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me. My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, \"I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?\" I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, \"What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?\" I said yes, and hung up to cry. I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real. I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer. One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me. This can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings. At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened. The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay. The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue. The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub. One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it. I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused. I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation. When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That’s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing. Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like: How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we’ll let Brock fill it in. I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now. And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember. So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so. He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear. Even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we \"met\", I’m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can’t do that, then no. Don’t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency. According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her. Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn’t [you] say, \"Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you.\" I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense. Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, \"At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.\" Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me? You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year. To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense. My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me. The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself. You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement. If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused. I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them. You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she. Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference. You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room. I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not. You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong. Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this. You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case. Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words. You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to \"speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.\" Speak out against campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less. Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide. I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct. Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life. Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was \"unconscious intoxicated woman\", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something. My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be. I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning. I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry. You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be. Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak. I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney’s closing statement began, \"My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.\" You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her. If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on. Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on. I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others. Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks. My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice. I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing. Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction. The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better. As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class. The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me. The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say. He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life. A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it? Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person. To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me. Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget. And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you.\n",

            "Topic: Why Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s fate could hang on a single word\n",
            "Paragraph: © REUTERS/Laura Segall Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announces newly launched program aimed at providing security around schools in Anthem, Arizona, January 9, 2013. PHOENIX — A single word — \"intentionally\" — could transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution. In finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona’s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges. Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow’s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio’s violations of his orders were intentional. In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio. \"The Defendants’ unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote. In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice. Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order \"out of spite\" and had arrested 500 people. He later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly. In Friday’s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count. \"The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,\" Snow wrote. \"In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.\" In hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself \"America’s toughest sheriff,\" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge. A lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow’s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn’t want to see Arpaio reelected. Arpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff’s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined. In his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos. Snow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives. Longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign. \"Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame,\" the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said in a statement Friday. The ACLU, which brought the original case against Arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff’s office. \"Strong remedies are needed to protect the community’s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct,\" said Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. \"Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.\" The ruling Friday was one of Arpaio’s most serious defeats, but it doesn’t bar him from holding office, and he had already announced his intention to run for a seventh term as sheriff in November.\n",

            "Paragraph: A teacher's Facebook post explaining her reasoning for writing letters to more than 100 students has gone viral after she revealed she was left in tears by a parent's heartbreaking revelation. Brittni Darras, a teacher in Colorado, USA, posted two pictures of a table filled with the letters addressed to her pupils. They are clearly all unique, with Brittni taking the time to write bespoke messages to each young person. Explaining what motivated her, she wrote: \"Two months ago was the first time I cried during parent/teacher conferences. \"A mom of a student who I have taught for two years showed up at my table and proceeded to explain to me the reason for her daughter’s extended absence. (Photo: Facebook) \"Her daughter - a friendly, intelligent, beautiful, driven, young woman - not only planned to commit suicide, but was in the act of doing so when the police broke in and stopped her. \"She had deleted her social media accounts and left goodbye letters; she was ready to leave the world.\" Brittni explains that she and the girl's mother both had tears streaming down their faces as they talked. To combat her helpless feeling, the teacher asked if she could write a letter to the student at the hospital, and was told that she would love that. \"My student got the letter; her mom said that her daughter cried, turned to her mom and said: 'How could somebody say such nice things about me? I didn't think anybody would miss me if I was gone.' (Photo: Getty) \"It made me realise that I was way too close to losing another student to suicide. I spent the next two months writing cards to every one of my students - over 100 of them - telling each one what is special and unique about them.\" Brittni goes on to say that she believes suicide is becoming more and more common because of the pressure we put on kids to be successful. to fit in or to be the best. She ends her note with a lesson for us all, saying: \"We need to remember that each human being is unique and that is what makes them special. \"Instead of trying to change it, we need to embrace it, because together, we can make a difference, and we can save lives! #suicideawareness.\" If you feel like you're struggling and need to talk to someone, Samaritans offer a free helpline around the clock, 365 days a year.

            "Paragraph:  Want to vacation like a celeb? Casa Elizabeth, the Palm Springs villa once owned by Elizabeth Taylor, is now available for rent by model-turned-mogul Kathy Ireland. (Photo courtesy of Kathy Ireland Weddings and Resorts) So when you're Oprah Winfrey and you're the richest female celebrity in America and you have a net worth of $2.8 billion (yes, BILLION), where do you go when you want to get away from it all? The famous talk show host's travel picks might surprise you. Today, Forbes released its first-ever ranking of the wealthiest American celebrities, giving a peek into the bank accounts of some of the richest people on the planet. Most interesting to us here at Women@Forbes are the women on the list: self-made celebs for whom money is no object and who travel in private planes, sail on sleek yachts, stay in expensive villas and own multimillion-dollar vacation homes. Because we are travel obsessed, we decided to take a look at how the other half   actually, the top 1% of the 1%   spends their vacation time. Women In The Forbes Top 20 Oprah Winfrey's horse farm in California. (Photo courtesy of Sage Auctions/Lands of America) Oprah Winfrey: net worth $2.8 billion The richest woman on the Forbes list has deemed 2017 the Year of Adventure in the January 2017 issue of O. For the cover story of the magazine, Oprah Winfrey even jetted off to one of the nation's most dramatic natural wonders: the Grand Canyon. And yet, she confesses in the magazine's pages that she's actually a homebody. It makes sense: Earlier this year Winfrey bought a $28.9 million equestrian ranch in California. On the 42-acre property is a 4,800-square-foot house with four fireplaces and a pool, plus plenty of horse stables and riding rings. This isn't Winfrey's only cushy crash pad: She also owns a $14 million mountaintop ski chalet in Telluride, Colorado with its own wine mine, as well as over-the-top properties in Santa Barbara, California, and Maui.  Madonna walks along a street in Havana. (Photo courtesy of YAMIL LAGE/AFP/Getty Images) Madonna: net worth $560 million The next woman on the list is the travel-obsessed Material Girl herself, Madonna. She has made most of her riches due to her concert tours (which have grossed a staggering $1.4 billion). For her birthday this August, Madonna jetted off to Cuba with her children and a group of close friends. They danced on tables at a bar in Havana, toured the city in vintage 1950s cars and stayed at the Hotel Saratoga. In the past year alone, the Queen of Pop has had a number of glamorous trips. She has also been spotted in the southern Italy town of Puglia for a friend's wedding; in the African countries of Kenya and Malawi with her adopted children; and in London, just to name a few. And that's not all: Madonna also owns a horse farm in the tony Hamptons enclave of Bridgehampton, a triple-wide townhouse in Manhattan and she reportedly bought a $20 million penthouse in Tel Aviv. It's no wonder one of Madonna's most famous songs is Holiday   she lives it. It's no wonder Barbra Streisand escapes to Malibu, with scenery like this. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock) Barbra Streisand: net worth $370 million Record sales have paid off for another singer   Barbra Streisand, who ranks number 19 on the Forbes list, with an impressive $370 million fortune. Her escape of choice: a clifftop oceanfront compound in the California beach town of Malibu, where Barbra has her own personal shopping arcade that includes stores where she can display her collections of antiques. The singer and her husband James Brolin also like to escape to places like the Spanish island of Mallorca and St. Tropez on the French Riviera.

Among her many business ventures, Ireland rents out a group of homes, so anyone can vacation just like the supermodel herself. One noteworthy property is Casa Elizabeth, the Palm Springs estate that used to belong to Elizabeth Taylor and has been dubbed The Jewel of the Desert. Ireland originally designed the four-bedroom five-bath property for Taylor. Other locations for Ireland's staggeringly beautiful vacation villas: Greece, Hawaii and Fiji.

Ireland is one of her favorite retreats, naturally: A number of her books are set there. Roberts has also helped turn her hometown of Boonsboro, Maryland   a rural village near Antietam   into a vacation destination in its own right. She owns two restaurants, a bookstore in a pre-Civil War building called Turn the Page, a gift shop and Inn BoonsBoro, a hotel with rooms named for literary couples like Jane and Rochester from Jane Eyre. The Montage Beverly Hills, where Judge Judy owns a condo. (Photo courtesy of Montage Beverly Hills) Judge Judy: net worth $330 million With a growing portfolio of luxurious vacation homes across the U.S., you could say TV's top judge (real name, Judith Sheimdlin) has another career: real-estate mogul. Her new $8.9 million mansion in Naples, Florida mansion is more like a resort, with multiple bedrooms, a lagoon and three waterfalls, no less. She also owns a nine-bedroom manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut; a five-bedroom condo at the luxe Montage Beverly Hills hotel; and an $8.5 million duplex penthouse in Manhattan. It's hard to imagine she has any free time with so many residences, but Judge Judy has also been known to strut her stuff in spots like the Exumas, a chain of islands in the Bahamas.

            "Paragraph: \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt will moderate the first presidential debate Monday. (Photo by Jose Luis Villegas/the Sacramento Bee via AP) Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News\" will moderate Monday's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Previous moderators have advised this year's questioners to be as invisible as possible, but scrutiny is inevitable. Before the lights go on, here are five things to know about Holt: Holt is a registered Republican Donald Trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators. He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode. \"They're hitting Matt Lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're — they're trying to game the system,\" Trump told Fox News last weekend. \"They want — and this, I think, is terrible — they want the hosts to go after Trump. And that's what they're doing by gaming the system.\" Conspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be. \"Lester is a Democrat,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly last week. \"It’s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It’s a very unfair system.\" These are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Time magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make. Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992 Holt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president. Holt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV's nightly newscast: \"Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.\" Dominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning. \"We are journalists first,\" Carter said. \"That's a huge distinction. We're not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.\" He's not really into the Twitter Holt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. He was fairly active while in Rio de Janeiro during NBC's coverage of the Olympics, sharing images like these: Scratching item off list of things I've never done before a newscast. Beach volleyball.

His relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to Trump's obsession. He moderated a Democratic primary debate Holt got to practice his moderating skills at a Democratic debate in January, though he split questioning duties that night with Andrea Mitchell. He was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked Clinton about the \"reset button\" with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state. \"Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009,\" Holt said. \"Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\" Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree Apparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. \"Meet the Press\" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University. (He told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) The late ABC anchor Peter Jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school. Holt left California State University-Sacramento after two years to work at a radio station in San Francisco. The Sacramento Bee told the story last year: Lester Holt Sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of California State University, Sacramento, to work at a San Francisco radio station. But he wasn’t as worried as his wife, June. \"She predicted poverty and failure,\" he said with a laugh. But the Rancho Cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that Lester Jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism. Things worked out okay. Since dropping out, Holt has received honorary doctorates from Cal State Sacramento and Pepperdine University.\n",

            "Paragraph: The George & Dragon was praised for its range of real ales and cider A small Yorkshire pub which was saved from closure by its local community after going bankrupt has been named the best in the UK. After the George & Dragon shut its doors in 2008, the village of Hudswell was left with no other facilities other than a village hall. But, by raising £220,000, the locals were able to buy the pub back and perform extensive renovations. Since opening its doors again in June 2010, the George & Dragon has expanded to offer far more than any traditional pub. It’s the home to the village library, a local shop, community allotments and provides free internet access for its patrons.  Now, The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has given the George & Dragon a top accolade by naming it national pub of the year. Beating more than 50,000 others to the title, CAMRA applauded the pub for it \"welcoming atmosphere\" and \"strong community\" ethos. It was also praised for its range of real ales and cider, along with the beer terrace, which offers panoramic views over the Swale Valley. Stu Miller, Landlord of the George & Dragon said: \"We are truly thrilled to have been recognised by CAMRA with this award.\" \"We're a small Yorkshire Dales pub, owned by the community and run by me and my family, I'm extremely proud of what our little pub has achieved.\" But if you can't make it to Yorkshire, be sure to check out the runners-up in the competition which are Salutation Inn in Ham, Gloucestershire, the Stanford Arms in Lowestoft, Norfolk and the Swan with Two Necks in Pendleton, Lancashire.\n",

            "Topic: How safe is your DNA?\n",
            "Paragraph: A new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our DNA CBS News correspondent Anne Marie Green writes about how she came across this story, and the Angie Dodge murder investigation, which she reported for \"48 Hours\" in \"The DNA of a Killer.\" I first learned about the 20-year-old murder of Angie Dodge in a roundabout way, after getting my DNA analyzed by one of those commercial DNA databases. When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation. After getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you’re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road. Then I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a \"familial DNA\" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State’s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase \"familial DNA\" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous \"Grim Sleeper,\" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest. A little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer’s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating. As I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie’s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent. After I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge’s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp’s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to \"48 Hours\" executive producer Susan Zirinsky. Chris Tapp, serving time for the murder of Idaho teen Angie Dodge, shows CBS News correspondent Anne-Marie Green what his life is like inside the... The day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie’s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp’s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?   Right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for. Despite what happened, Michael Usry’s father does not regret participating in a DNA study, but rest assured that his son never will.\n",

            "Paragraph: For many of us, childhood was a carefree time of little responsibility with plenty of opportunity for play and exploration. However, the situation isn’t quite the same for today’s kids, who often find themselves dealing with hours of homework each week, extensive testing in school and extra-curricular activities as well. Over half has shown signs of depression Research into children’s wellbeing suggests that today’s kids are more anxious than those of generations past. What’s more is that this has ramifications not only on their academic success and overall happiness, but also on their health. Dr. Stuart Slavin, a professor based at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine, believes that excessive emphasis on academic success has resulted in an unprecedented epidemic of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Dr. Slavin undertook a survey in which he asked 1400 students from Irvington High School, Silicon Valley, about their mental wellbeing. He administered two commonly-used tools for assessing mental health, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. He was shocked to discover that over half of the participants showed signs of moderate or severe depression, and over three-quarters struggled with anxiety. Furthermore, these figures may not even tell the full story because some of these students missed the opportunity to take the survey, in order to sit and write school exams. Teenagers feel as stressed as adults Traditionally, high-pressure academic environments and resulting mental health issues were thought to be the preserve of elite institutions attended by middle and upper-class students. However, it appears that young people of every socioeconomic background are impacted by the ever-increasing demands placed upon them. A study of over 1,000 teenagers carried out by the American Psychological Association showed that although they may officially have fewer responsibilities, teenagers feel as stressed as adults, especially during the school year. Continuous pressure to maintain high grades can also exert a negative impact on a child’s physical health. Medical science has long known of the connection between pressure, stress and various ailments in adults, but increasingly children and teens are also showing signs of illness caused by prolonged anxiety. Dr. Lawrence Rosen, a paediatrician based in New Jersey, has called attention to the increasing numbers of children he sees in his clinics with stress-related issues including stomach ulcers and migraines. These early life experiences are training children to accept high stress levels as inevitable and normal. The current generation of children are learning that the cost of success is illness, and they are likely to carry this unhealthy attitude with them as they move on to adulthood. What can concerned parents do? To avoid subjecting your child to undue stress, focus on affirming them for who they are rather than what you may wish for them to be. Each child has their own special mix of talents and abilities, so find out what your child is good at and praise them accordingly rather than dwelling on their weaknesses. Moreover, children should be given regular, unstructured free-time, in which they can relax and learn to entertain themselves. This teaches them that they do not need to concern themselves only with academic or professional success, and that they need not rely on others to schedule entertaining activities for them. Finally, children should also be taught that moral character and making a positive contribution to the wider world is just as important as academic success. Parents can model this behavior, and encourage their children to become well-rounded citizens. Get An Awesome Life I'm in! Love this article?\n",

            "Topic: Massachusetts Is The Best Place To Live If You're A Woman\n",
            "Paragraph: The Northeast ― especially Massachusetts ― is the healthiest place in the country for women and children to live, according to the \"America’s Health Rankings\" report published this month by United Health Foundation. The report compared all 50 states based on 60 health measures in four categories: health behavior of residents, policy, socio-structural factors and health care. The researchers looked specifically at women’s health. They analyzed factors including the rate of sexually transmitted diseases, obesity and smoking (the behavioral component); the number of publicly-funded women’s health services and rate of health insurance (policy); food insecurity, intimate partner violence and poverty (socio-structural) and cervical cancer screenings, dental care and vaccinations (health care). Infant health was compared on metrics like infant mortality, being breastfed, and receiving a home health visit as a baby. For children and teens, health measures included using drugs, graduating high school, having obesity and adverse childhood experiences. Unsurprisingly, poor states did poorly and rich states did well. But notably, the state that’s had universal health care the longest ― Massachusetts ― did the best. That’s important because it gives us a window into what the federal Obamacare program might be able to accomplish, and also gives us a roadmap for states such as Mississippi that are struggling. \"One of the key pieces of information the study provided was that a child’s home and neighborhood can really create an environment for unhealthy behaviors early in their childhood,\" Dr. Ana Fuentevilla, chief medical officer of UnitedHealth Community & State, told Vox. \"Chronic conditions in children are not always related to genetics, but [are] related to home and community environment.\" How women’s, children’s and infant health stacks up, state by state: America’s Health Rankings Health of Women and Children Report/ 2016 United Health Foundation What Massachusetts gets right A key part of Massachusetts’ success is low infant, neonatal and child mortality, coupled with a low prevalence of obesity among women. These metrics are part of a larger story about the way the state approaches health care. Because of the state’s relative prosperity and universal health care program, only 3.5 percent of Massachusetts residents are uninsured, compared to Texas, where 21 percent of residents are uninsured. Access to health insurance is key indicator of good health outcomes. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsured receive less preventative care and fewer recommended screenings than their insured counterparts. They’re also at higher risk for preventative hospitalizations and missed diagnoses of serious health conditions. And in addition to insurance, Massachusetts boasts a high rate of primary care physicians per capita, which makes preventative health care more accessible for residents. Of course, Massachusetts has some health challenges, too. The state has high rates of violent crime and excessive drinking among men and women, which over time can lead to health problems like high blood pressure and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And unfortunately, universal health care coverage has not yet solved the problem of people with less education getting worse health care and having worse health outcomes than their better-educated peers. It’s a tough problem, and tightly tied to a constellation of social, environmental factors that can’t be solved by access to care alone. Mississippi battles poverty and childhood mortality Mississippi’s last-place ranking is due, in part, to its poor record on mortality. The state ranks last in low birthweight and preterm birth, unintended pregnancy, and infant, neonatal and childhood mortality. Citizens also face socio-structural challenges, such as food insecurity and poverty, which can seriously damage health. According to a 2015 study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, kids in the most food-insecure households were 33 to 44 percent more likely to be overweight and 1.5 times more likely to be obese than those in food-secure homes. Obesity, of course, is linked to a host of negative consequences, including an increased risk for heart disease, cancer and anxiety, all of which drive down overall health and well-being. Racial disparities persist countrywide In addition to comparing health between states, the new report’s health snapshot compared health among racial groups and found key disparities. For instance, infant mortality is more than twice as high among blacks as it is among whites, one piece of the larger landscape of poorer health outcomes for black Americans compared to white Americans. Drug overdose deaths, on the other hand, disproportionally affect white Americans, with white women dying from drugs twice as often as black women and three times as often as Hispanic women.\n",

            "Paragraph: - After much debate, former President Ferdinand Marcos is now to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani despite the majority's objection of President Rodrigo Duterte's decision - Recently, US Army records revealed that Marcos' accounts during his time as a guerilla soldier are not only exaggerated but falsified as well - The former president was apparently arrested and jailed for illegally collecting money for a construction of an airfield in Baguio Another shocking revelation about President Ferdinand Marcos has been released as US Army records disclosed that some of his accounts as a guerilla soldier in World War II has been falsified. These records were formerly classified but since it has been transferred to the US National Archives, it is now available in the Philippines and also comes in a digital format. ABS-CBN News Channel, abbreviated as ANC, has released a brief special report on the matter, tapping Dr. Ricardo Jose to add more details to the released records. Jose, who also serves as the Director of UP Third World Studies Center, claimed that he has spoken to war veterans who knew of Marcos' secret but were afraid to speak up in public. He said that there were eye-witnesses during that time but they asked him not to release the information publicly since he interviewed them during the height of martial law. According to the records, Marcos claimed that his 'Ang Mga Maharlika' o Maharlika guerillas were composed of 8,000 soldiers. US Army examiners deemed this to be an exaggeration. UP Third World Studies Center Director Ricardo Jose (L) and the late president Ferdinand Marcos (R) (photo credit: newsfeed.ph) They also found several anomalies involving money - the former president was arrested and jailed for illegally collecting funds for a supposed airfield in Baguio in December 1944. The construction of the infrastructure was said to be for the rescue of General Manuel Roxas and his family. Marcos also requested to be compensated for his efforts, which consist of P100,000 as well as 500,000 in Japanese notes for the maintenance of his unit. \"Nag-file siya ng compensation for the US sa mga kagamitan niya na nawala sa digmaan which included among other things parang mga cattle sa Mindanao na naturn down ng US,\" Jose said. (He filed a compensation in the US for the equipment that was lost in the war, which included among other things, cattle in Mindanao. It was turned down by the US.) He added that the money Marcos requested cannot be easily approved since during that time even one cent had a value. The report also exposed that members of the Maharlika Unit were doing business with the Japanese by selling strategic sources. Prior to this recently-released information, other war-related news about Marcos was revealed during the 80s. (photo credit: philstar.com) Despite the anomalies presented by the report, Marcos has shown a different motive on his letter requesting recognition from the US. In his letter, he ended his address meant for his fellow guerillas that they should seek peace instead of glory. \"Return to your homes and leave behind the ways of war. Take up the ways of peace - the peace that you have won. And if your name must remain unknown, remember that your greatness lies in this anonymity,\" he wrote. The late president is about to buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani next month. (Photo from inquirer.net) He claimed that he was the most bemedalled Anti-Japanese guerilla soldier during World War II, but the records proved otherwise.

            "Paragraph: On Monday, police in Iowa shot dead an unarmed teenager after a family dispute, and his relatives are now demanding answers. According to The Associated Press, Tyler Comstock, 19, of Boone, was fatally shot the morning of Nov. 4 after a car chase with police ended on Iowa State University's central campus in Ames. Explaining how the teen found himself in a face-off with police, Comstock's family says that the events of that fateful morning had been triggered by an argument between the young man and his father. \"He just wanted a pack of cigarettes, and his dad wouldn’t buy him a pack of cigarettes and he freaked out,\" the teen's mother, Shari Comstock, told the Iowa State Daily. After the feud, Comstock reportedly got into his father's car and took off. That's when his dad, James Comstock, decided to call the police to report his vehicle stolen. \"He took off with my truck. I call the police, and they kill him,\" James Comstock told the Des Moines Register. It is believed that the truck belonged to the lawn care company for which the father and son both worked. After James Comstock's call, police were soon on the teenager's tail. Comstock, however, reportedly refused to stop his vehicle and rammed into an officer's car. Police then pursued him to Iowa State University's campus in Ames. Eventually surrounded by cops, Comstock finally came to a stop on the school's Central Campus, but the young man reportedly ignored orders to turn his engine off. It was then that a police officer named Adam McPherson is said to have fired six shots into the truck. The teen, believed to have been unarmed, died from two gunshot wounds, per the AP. Comstock's family is flabbergasted as to how a minor family dispute turned into an unspeakable tragedy. \"So he didn’t shut the damn truck off, so let’s fire six rounds at him? We’re confused, and we don’t understand,\" Comstock’s step-grandfather, Gary Shepley, told the Register. According to dispatch audio obtained by the news outlet, an unidentified police staffer suggested on two different occasions during the chase that officers back off their pursuit of Comstock. (Listen to the dispatch at the Des Moines Register.) \"I don’t understand [why this happened] when I blatantly heard them say, ‘Hey, we know who this is. It’s a kid, back off.’ I don’t get it,\" Comstock's mom told the Iowa State Daily after listening to the audio tape of the dispatch. Police say Comstock may have put lives in danger when he drove through the university and that student pedestrians had to dodge his truck \"to avoid being run over,\" per the AP. However, his mother questioned the officers' actions and how they may have affected the situation. \"Why the hell would they chase him into campus with all the people?\" she told the State Daily. \"Tyler would never hurt anybody, ever. He was just a scared child. He’s pretty rational when he calms down.\"\n",

The music legend has produced and released many Billboard chart-toppers and Grammy Award winners over the years, but admits that even he doesn't always get it right. When Gordy appeared on \"Oprah's Master Class,\" he opened up about a Temptations album he didn't want to release -- an album that won Motown its first Grammy. The reason behind Gordy's reluctance? Responsibility. \"A song is a very powerful thing in somebody's mind, especially young people,\" Gordy explains. \"I taught my [Motown staff], 'What a child hears, he believes; what he believes, he does.'... We stayed away from songs that were attacking anybody because a lot of people will follow our songs and song ideas.\" This meant that Gordy would argue against a song or album that didn't align with his vision for Motown. He may have been the founder of the company, but was so dedicated to its democratic structure, he would allow himself to be outvoted by his Motown colleagues. This is exactly what happened with the Temptations' psychedelic album \"Cloud Nine.\" \"I said that was a drug record and I didn't want to put it out,\" Gordy says simply. \"[My staff] outvoted me. I was very, very upset.\" Motown released \"Cloud Nine,\" despite Gordy's disapproval, and the album's title track won the Grammy for Best Rhythm & Blues Group Performance, Vocal or Instrumental in 1969. \"It happened, it won and so that was great. But, still. I still think it's a drug record,\" Gordy says with a laugh.\n",

But both women know what it's like to be on top of their game, and they both know what it's like to attract attention for their outlandish styling -- in fact, as their friendship's grown, Gaga has started dressing more and more like a Versace girl, trying out a version of Elizabeth Hurley's safety pin dress and donning Versace archival pieces for her videos. And now, of course, she's doing her best Donatella in Versace's new ads. What better way for two women to celebrate a friendship than with a high fashion campaign?\n",

            "Paragraph: (SPOT.ph) For those of us who don’t work there, attending a conference or a meeting at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Ortigas requires an appointment in the system, a photo ID taken on the spot, and a bout with two X-ray machines. But the bank’s real treasures aren’t in some vault, they’re in plain sight—the ADB canteen offers scrumptious meals from several Asian cuisines at affordable prices, as well as a bakery that serves up all kinds of breads, pies, and pastries. While the bibimbap, tempura bento, and walnut pie might all be worth breaking and entering for, the real crown jewels of the ADB canteen are the chocolate crinkles baked in-house daily. You hear about them—the cookies in that really strict building. They've become a legend on their own, and out of reach. And just like clockwork, a queue forms every day at mid-afternoon for these hockey pucks from heaven. Time your appointment just right and fall in line for the chocolate crinkles (P14/piece). While you’re at it, pick up some brewed coffee at just P11 (bring your own tumbler or shell out P10 for a paper cup!) and take your double handful of happiness out to a bench in the courtyard. For the price, these crinkles are huge—each one is three inches in diameter and half an inch thick, with considerable heft to it. Pull a crinkle apart—it’s very dense, and very moist. I love that it’s really more like a half-baked, dollar pancake-shaped brownie than your typical small, dry, boring convenience store crinkle. The surface, lightly dusted with confectioner’s sugar, just barely holds the structure together, and provides a subtle, cookie-like textural contrast to the chewy interiors. Pop it in your mouth and you’ll find that the dark, bittersweet chocolate is as rich and rewarding as it looks. There’s no doubt that the bakers don’t scrimp on the good stuff. In fact, these crinkles are so decadent, I have trouble finishing more than one at a time. They’re the best I’ve had in Manila because unlike others, they’re well-balanced—the sweetness is just right and isn’t overwhelming, thanks to the good chocolate worked skillfully by the bakers, and the delicate touch taken with the confectioner’s sugar.

            "Topic: Can You Really Drink Too Much Water? Here’s the Truth About How Much You Should Consume\n",
            "Paragraph: he importance of hydration is hardly breaking news. We're told throughout science classes that the body is made up of more than two-thirds of water. It helps with our bodily functions, such as our kidneys and digestive system. . There's no single formula for how much water someone should drink — it depends on their weight, activity level and environment. Typically, someone should drink about four to six cups of water a day to aid the hydration that comes with eating foods that have fluid in them, according to the Harvard Health Letter Ultimately, the best method to optimal hydration is to listen to our intuitive thirst levels. Over-hydration, while possible, is rare. \"More people by far and away are dehydrated, [rather] than having a problem with over-hydration,\" Assistant Professor of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine Sharon Bergquist told \"More people by far and away are dehydrated, [rather] than having a problem with over-hydration,\" Assistant Professor of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine Sharon Bergquist told WebMD When it does happen, though, over-hydration can cause water intoxication, bodily swelling and dangerously low sodium levels. Basically, the kidneys are unable to filter out fluids at the rate of intake. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, confusion and fatigue. Endurance athletes are especially prone to over-consuming water, according to a 2015 study . If you participate in physical activity that results in excessive sweating, the suggested amount of additional water intake is 1.5 to 2.5 glasses, but you should never be drinking more than one liter of fluid per hour. It's impossible to accurately track your hydration levels, but one way is by checking the color of your urine. Dark urine means you're not drinking enough while urinating out clear water (and at a frequent rate) means you may be drinking too much. \"There's a fine line,\" Chris McStay, an emergency medicine doctor, told WebMD. \"It's important to listen to your body. If you're pushing fluids beyond the point it's comfortable, it's a sign it's time to stop drinking.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Say the words \"fast food\" to many Americans, and they’ll immediately turn up their noses, picturing grease-slicked tables, sullen cashiers and calorie-laden menu options. But one fast food chain stands apart from the others in terms of customer satisfaction: Chick-fil-A. The chicken restaurant gets the highest customer satisfaction score of any fast-food chain that American Customer Satisfaction Index has measured over its 21-year history, according to a survey of more than 4,700 Americans released Tuesday from the ACSI. The fast-food chain scores an 87 out of 100 in terms of customer satisfaction, making it not only the highest-scoring fast-food chain this year, but also the highest scoring company out of the more than 300 large companies that ACSI measures. And in a Harris Poll of 97,120 U.S. consumers, Chick-fil-A ranked as the top chicken restaurant in America. \"They do one thing and they do it well — chicken,\" says David VanAmburg, managing director of the ACSI, about why the restaurant is so popular with its customers. Or as Wall Street Journal food writer Charles Passy puts it, \"The Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich — grilled or fried — is one of those Great American Things.\" ​‘Finding Dory’ breaks box office record in U.S. and Canada (1:13) ​What a catch: \"Finding Dory\" has netted $136.2 million at the box office in its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, a record for an animated film. Despite these high scores, Chick-fil-A has angered many consumers with its anti-gay politics (in 2012, the president of the company said he was against gay marriage), and some customers still refuse to go to the restaurant because of this. (MarketWatch’s Moneyologist weighed in on whether you can go to Chick-fil-A if you don’t agree with its politics.) In response to complaints about its president’s beliefs, the company said the Chick-fil-A brand represents many dimensions of humanity via its 80,000 employees. \"But what they all have in common is a heart for service and passion for making great food,\" a spokeswoman said. Others knock the menu and say many options aren’t the healthiest (the Spicy Chicken Deluxe sandwich clocks in at 570 calories and 27 grams of fat — which puts it roughly on par with the McDonald’s MCD, -0.26% Quarter Pounder with Cheese in terms of fat and calories). The Chick-fil-A spokeswoman said the company is \"ever-mindful of creating a healthy balance of ‘choice’\" for customers, and provided a link to meals it offers that are less than 500 calories. But despite these criticisms, the chicken chain is flourishing: In 2015, its sales hit $6 billion, marking 48 straight years of sales growth. Chick-fil-A’s high score comes at a time when customer satisfaction with fast-food restaurants in general is rising (customer satisfaction with fast-food restaurants climbed two points from last year to 79 out of 100). VanAmburg says this is due, in part, to better quality ingredients (for example, many fast-food chains have vowed to use cage-free eggs) and consistently low prices.\n",

            "Paragraph: If you still have any energy left after waiting for an answer over the course of all these years, begin to !!!!!!!!!! \"I would say just judging by the street names and locations, it’s closer to Springfield, Oregon, where Matt Groening is from, than any other Springfield,\" said Jean. Jean began his answer by saying the team behind \"The Simpsons\" could never actually reveal that, but then continued with a hint that was more or less an admission. During a press conference call promoting the series’ new season that began last Sunday, a reporter from MyNewYorkEye bluntly asked executive producer Al Jean, \"Where is Springfield? Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\" So by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy. The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family’s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location. Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn’t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well. In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here’s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection: OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn’t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it’s their Springfield.\" And they do. You’ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that’s right.\" This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\" Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it’s really an every town. It’s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of ‘The Simpsons’ were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\" Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town’s true whereabouts are geographically impossible. \"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you’re a true ‘Simpsons’ fan.\" For what it’s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky. In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the ‘real’ Springfield from ‘The Simpsons.’\" Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show’s city] is it’s universal. I grew up in Michigan, and I can totally relate to it. Anybody, wherever you’re from, has a Springfield near them.\" The people of Oregon are just especially close.

            "Paragraph: For some unpleasant things in life, it seems to be a point of pride to declare that you have it the very worst. People one-up their friends on who had the most embarrassing drunken weekend, argue that their mother-in-law horror story is the most outrageous, or insist that their city has with the worst traffic. It makes us remember that painful encounters and daily nuisances are shared experiences—making a competition out of it brings a bit of comfort. So if you are a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, congratulations: The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has awarded your city the dubious honor of having the worst allergies in the United States this spring. As we sneeze and sniffle our way through this year’s long spring allergy season—likely to last through June in most places in the country, according to the AAFA—it seems as fine a time as any for Louisvillians to enjoy your honor (as best you can). If you do not live in Louisville, don’t feel too defeated. The city’s position at the top of the list is tenuous, and it may very well be lost next year. The AAFA’s rankings, which are ordered by a formula taking into account pollen levels, allergy medication used, and number of allergists, change from year to year. East Coasters like to complain about allergies a lot, but their suffering is actually mild compared to that of folks in some inland parts of the United States. New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Washingtonians may believe that the country revolves around them, which has somehow convinced them that they must also be at the epicenter of massive swirls of pollen. But actually, if you live in Tennessee, Kansas, or Ohio, you have a much better shot at bragging rights next spring; cities in these states regularly make the top 10 worst places for spring allergies. This year Memphis, Tennessee, came in second, followed by Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Oklahoma City; and Jackson, Mississippi. Knoxville, Tennessee, occupied the top spot for three years in a row, from 2009 to 2011. On the whole, spring allergies are worse in the southern and eastern United States than the north and west, says James Sublett of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, because there are more deciduous trees simultaneously releasing pollen on those sides of the country. There are slightly more allergy-inducing species of trees in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and South (25) compared to the West and Midwest (23). Their golden flowery powder is permeating the air, floating into your nostrils, and causing your immune system to think you are under attack. (It’s even worse if you’re middle-aged.) Geographic features aid in making some places traps for pollen. Louisville, for example, is in a river valley, ensuring that the city will be enveloped each year by the fine particulates its lush surrounding flora release to breed. The Cumberland Mountains to the northwest and Smoky Mountains to the southeast guard Knoxville, preventing allergy-causing pollens from its local trees (elm, hazelnut, willow, walnut, and mulberry, among others) from escaping. But of course, spring is not the only time for allergies. Anyone in Texas knows that from December to February, collective misery ensues as people suffer from bouts of \"cedar fever.\" (Cedar inspires such hatred in Texas that a group called \"People Against Cedar\" denounces the trees as \"a plague.\") And in autumn, weeds and grasses throughout the country will bring new dustings of stuff to make your nose run.\n",

Different locations yield different Pokémon, and in order to catch ’em all, you’ll need to visit a lot of different locations. Or maybe not. One player has been able to capture all 145 of the currently available Pokémon, including all of the region exclusives from Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan – where you can find, respectively, Mr. Mime, Tauros, Kangaskhan, and Farfetch’d. How, you ask? It’s simple, but it’ll likely require a large amount of walking around, hatching eggs, and hoping for the best. One Trainer from California claims to have caught all 145 currently available Pokémon, including all region exclusives, by hatching eggs – 10km eggs, to be precise. Essentially, this gave him the ability to capture all the region exclusive Pokémon without the need to find them in another country. Speaking with Eurogamer, the player said the following: \"My name is John Smith and I caught all my Pokémon in California.\" He further elaborated, telling Eurogamer’s Tom Phillips that he’d done most of the searching in his hometown, Santa Rosa, and around San Francisco. Smith uploaded a video on his YouTube channel, running us through his impressive Pokédex, and all 145 of his catches. He really did catch ’em all – for now at least. When Legendaries eventually roll around, he’ll have 6 more to add to his collection. And \"John Smith\"? What an awesome name to have.\n",

            "Paragraph: When Melissa Banigan started suffering from a mystery illness, doctors simply told her to rest and eat better. Twenty years later she finally has a diagnosis Twenty years ago, I started experiencing what turned into a long list of seemingly unrelated health issues. Headaches, depression, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, joint pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, a lesion on my spine and a variety of uncomfortable gastrointestinal ailments. Over the past five years, things went from bad to worse as I also became lactose intolerant, developed mild vitiligo (a condition that leads to loss of skin pigmentation) and major vertigo, experienced a series of low-grade fevers and started to have some memory loss that I referred to as brain fogs. Doctors told me that as an overworked 40-year-old single mother, I might just need to figure out ways to get more sleep and relax. Some of what was happening, they said, might be attributed to the normal processes of ageing. What was happening, however, didn’t feel normal. Always a voracious reader and a writer by profession, I could no longer focus on work, read even a page of a book or grip a pen long enough to write a shopping list. I often felt too exhausted to keep plans with friends. When I did pull myself off my couch to see them, I couldn’t concentrate on conversations, so I stayed at home and let my friendships fade. I had been a runner, a swimmer and a hiker, but just walking up a flight of stairs made me lose my breath so completely that I succumbed to inactivity. I did everything the doctors asked me to do. I changed my diet and sleep schedule, went to a physical therapist and saw specialists in neurology and rheumatology and even a mental-health therapist. I then also turned to massage therapists, herbalists and an acupuncturist. Despite all of this, my symptoms worsened. The pins and needles sensations of the peripheral neuropathy in my arms and legs became so uncomfortable that it was difficult to sleep, and feelings of dread and severe joint pain roused me with a jolt most mornings at 3 or 4 o’clock. I tried to maintain a normal work schedule, but it was cut short when I went into an intensive care unit after a common cold turned into pneumonia and I developed sepsis. My brain fogs, which previously had amounted to forgetting a few words or leaving my keys in odd places, worsened. I forgot my Social Security number, important deadlines and, once, even the date of my daughter's birth. One afternoon, I stood in a room and had no idea where I was. Confused and panicked, my world feeling black, I finally realised that I was in the kitchen of my apartment in Brooklyn. The myriad of symptoms I had been dealing with for 20 years was no longer manageable. Feeling sound in neither mind nor body, I was terrified. The next day, I went to a neurologist (the third over the past many years), mostly concerned with my memory loss. Early-onset Alzheimer’s felt like the elephant in the room, but I was assured that I was too young. After giving me a short memory test – during which I couldn’t remember even the name of the mayor of New York – he scheduled a second appointment to conduct a longer cognition battery. As usual, one of his nurses drew blood during the first appointment. I thought nothing of it until I received a phone call the next morning: \"You have a B12 deficiency,\" I was told. A vitamin found naturally only in animal-sourced foods such as red meat and dairy products, B12 has a key role in the functioning of the brain and nervous system and is necessary for making healthy red blood cells. I had been taking the vitamin daily for more than a year as an oral supplement while I explored a vegan diet, so I was more than a little surprised to find out that I had a deficiency. \"It’s treatable,\" my doctor continued, easing some of my concern. The only catch? My deficiency might be caused by an autoimmune disease called pernicious anaemia. A chronic disease, pernicious anaemia occurs when the immune system attacks the parietal cells in the gastric glands and the lining of the stomach. These cells secrete a protein called intrinsic factor, which bonds with B12 before being absorbed through the gut. Without intrinsic factor, the body absorbs very little B12, which in my case had led to a deficiency despite the oral supplements I had been taking. Symptoms of the disease vary, but I had many of them, and it was worrisome to learn that without treatment, final stages can lead to congestive heart failure, degeneration of the spinal column, neurological complications such as dementia and – until a medical therapy was discovered in 1926 – a long, slow death. In the early 1920s, biological researcher and physician George Whipple found through experiments with dogs that raw liver offset the effects of anaemia. A few years later, George Richards Minot and William Parry Murphy discovered that their human patients’ anaemic symptoms were alleviated after eating half a pound of raw or lightly cooked calf liver every day. Whipple, Minot and Murphy received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 for their groundbreaking discoveries. Because pernicious anaemia appears most often in people of Scandinavian or northern European descent, it may be a hereditary disease. I already knew of my family’s strong Irish roots, and a simple DNA test revealed a genetic connection to long-forgotten Scandinavian ancestors. The final piece of my familial puzzle fit into place after I described my symptoms to relatives. \"When I was a child,\" my aunt told me, \"your Nana took what she called ‘liver shots.’\" B12 had been synthesised as cyanocobalamin in 1948, meaning that by the time my tiny Irish American grandmother was my age, she was able to forgo what I imagine were unsavoury daily doses of undercooked liver and instead take injections prescribed by a doctor for pernicious anaemia. My first \"liver shot\" eased my symptoms to such a degree that I felt like a new person: For the first time in my adult life, the pain I had been living with washed away, and my brain fog lifted overnight. I wonder whether my grandmother had a similar experience. Despite how easy it is to treat B12 deficiencies, millions of people remain affected. In poorer countries, this is because they lack the vitamin in their diets. In the United States, close to 40 per cent of people may have deficiencies, although only 0.1 per cent of the general population and 1.9 per cent of people older than 60 have pernicious anaemia. In the UK, pernicious anaemia effects around half a million people. It took about 20 years for me to receive the diagnosis that led to my first B12 injection. Research shows that the disease can take 20 years or more to progress, with symptoms worsening slowly over time. I am still lactose intolerant and have symptoms such as vitiligo and the pins and needles of peripheral neuropathy. The injections stave off the worst of my brain fogs, vertigo and other symptoms. My symptoms return slowly about two weeks after an injection and quickly by the third week. My insurance covers only one injection of B12 a month, however, which means my health and mental state fluctuate greatly depending on the week. If I had diabetes, my insurer probably wouldn’t restrict my access to insulin. My condition shouldn’t be treated differently. I hope that over time, as more people learn about pernicious anaemia, there will be fewer limits on treatment. The Wales-based Pernicious Anaemia Society was founded by Martyn Hooper in 2005 to raise awareness of the disease. When he was diagnosed in 2002, Hooper said, \"there was no ‘plain English’ explanation of the disease available. I resorted to looking up the word ‘pernicious’ in the dictionary and discovered it meant ‘ruinous, destructive and fatal.’ It was obvious that nothing was available to newly diagnosed patients.\" The Pernicious Anaemia Society has more than 6,000 members, and I wish that there were such a group in the United States to raise awareness. I often feel frustrated with my insurer for not reimbursing me for all of the injections I need, and when I’m feeling my worst, I sometimes lament the loss of ruined romantic relationships or income from jobs I couldn’t complete because of my disease. I could have received a diagnosis much sooner. Yet a 20-year fog is lifting, and I’m hopeful that regular B12 injections will continue to make me feel better.\n",

            "Paragraph: Delhi has spent over Rs 2,000 crore on Yamuna clean-up in the last 22 years. This shocking revelation came during a hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday. The reality becomes starker when you consider recent and past data that show no improvement in water quality: total coliform, or mostly human and animal excreta, continues to be in lakhs, and even crores, when the standard is a maximum of 5,000 mpn/100 ml (most probably number/100 ml). Also, dissolved oxygen (DO), a must for many forms of life in the water, continues to be negligible, which reiterates that it's a dead river. DO levels in March months of 2002 and 2006 at Nizamuddin and Palla were 0; in 2016, these were 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. Total coliform levels went up to 16 crore in June last year. No Yamuna cleaning project has managed to bring a perceptible difference to water quality. Apart from Yamuna Action Plans on which the bulk of funds were spent, the National Green Tribunal, in its 2015 judgment, had ordered augmenting the functioning of sewage-treatment plants that are running under capacity and constructing 32 smaller STPs in a decentralised manner. \"According to DJB, there are 23 STP's planned and existing as of today in Delhi....the oxidation pond at Timarpur, which was commissioned in 1947, is proposed to be closed. There is an STP at Okhla, which was commissioned in 1937, and four STP's at Kondli are lying closed due to inadequate sewerage...the entire STP infrastructure, if made fully functional, can be utilised to support and aid implementation of the project,\" NGT had said. There is no implementation of this order so far. Delhi Jal Board claims that it has the capacity to treat 604 million gallons per day of sewage, of which it is treating about 75%. Brij Gopal, former JNU professor and a member of NGT's expert panel on the Yamuna, said: \"Nothing has moved. Sewage is not even reaching the STPs. If untreated sewage is flowing down the drain, what do you expect? Plus there is no flow in the river.\" Under phases I and II of the Yamuna Action Plan, launched in 1993, Rs 576.73 crore has already been spent. Under YAP-III, an additional Rs 1,600 crore has been allocated, which is yet to be used. \"Yamuna, like all of Delhi, has suffered due to multiplicity of agencies. Crores were definitely allocated but the money was used incoherently. DJB was doing something while the corporations were doing something else. We are hopeful now that the interceptor sewer system, when it is completed by next year, will finally clean the river,\" said a senior government official. Experts also say that policies to clean Yamuna have only been STP-oriented when the biggest issue is the fact that the river has no water or ecological flow. SC, in a 1998 order, had directed that 10 cumecs of water be released into the river through the year. Experts feel that 10 cumecs is inadequate, but as of now even that is not being released. Following NGT's 2015 judgment, about 10 cumecs is being released at Hatnikund, but that reduces significantly as it flows downstream. \"The only answer to this is to ensure more water is released. Sewage treatment alone cannot ensure unhindered flow\" said Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, who had moved NGT on Yamuna pollution. Meanwhile, both Centre and Delhi government have announced several cosmetic measures. For example, last year, Centre launched a trash skimmer to clean the water surface and announced a \"proper\" chhat ghat. In an effort to develop the river front, Delhi government started a Yamuna Aarti and developed a 'Nakshatra Vatika' along the river bed. Union water minister Uma Bharti had announced last year that Lakhwar Vyasi dam in Uttarakhand would release water in Yamuna during the lean season, which was contested by environmental experts because the project is unlikely to get environmental clearance.\n",

            "Topic: Why You Might Be Hearing That Donald Trump Donates Money To One Of The Worst Organizations On Earth\n",
            "Paragraph: Earlier today, sources reported to CNN that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is preparing to release her 2015 tax returns. Clinton’s decision is seen as a move to pressure her rival, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, to release his. But Trump has repeatedly refused to make his returns public, claiming that he’s being audited. But some believe that the real reason he won’t release them is because he’s hiding something. Could he be hiding thousands of dollars in donations to the much despised North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), a United States pedophile advocacy organization? The answer is most certainly ‘no’, but it’s something you might be hearing people say. Especially on Twitter: Where did this completely unfounded rumor start? From a \"very, very smart guy\" with \"the best words\" on Reddit. But why doesn’t Trump want to release his [tax returns]? Could it be because he donated a sizable amount of money to NAMBLA and he wants to cover it up? I’m not saying Trump donated money to NAMBLA, but people are saying that. It’s something I’ve heard, but I don’t believe Donald Trump donated several million dollars to NAMBLA over the last several years. Still, if he did that would be a great reason to not release his tax returns. But look, I’m not here to say whether or not Donald Trump donated millions to NAMBLA, I’m just here to let you know that every candidate has released his tax returns over the last 40 years, so there has to be a reason he doesn’t, and several very smart people are saying he contributed millions of dollars to NAMBLA. The Internet’s decision to fully embrace anything \"we’re hearing\" about Donald Trump is actually a backlash to the way the Republican candidate has made many baseless, slanderous accusations about his political opponents while keeping a safe personal distance by saying \"he’s heard\" them from other people. Although some may find it onerous to spread such rumors, Trump’s detractors feel it’s totally fair game to slander a man who has unapologetically spread terrible rumors in the same fashion. For example, here are just a few things that Trump at on epoint or another claimed to be \"hearing\": – President Obama is a Muslim – President Obama wasn't born in the United States – Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy – Ted Cruz was involved in a sex scandal – President Obama is setting up secret terrorist training camps inside the U.S. – The Iranians killed a scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton’s emails So until he releases his tax returns, you might be hearing from a lot of people, many highly educated people, about increasingly bizarre rumors concerning Mr. Trump.\n",

            "Paragraph: Whether or not you have siblings, it's likely that at some point or another you were told to share your toys. But one mum wants to rethink that message. Alanya Kolberg posted to Facebook last week about an interaction she and her son had with other children at the park. \"As soon as we walked in the park, Carson was approached by at least 6 boys, all at once demanding that he share his transformer, Minecraft figure, and truck,\" she wrote. \"He was visibly overwhelmed and clutched them to his chest as the boys reached for them. He looked at me. 'You can tell them no, Carson,' I said. 'Just say no. You don't have to say anything else.'\" When her son told the boys that they couldn't play with his toys, they ran to Kolberg to tell her that Carson wasn't sharing. \"I said, 'He doesn't have to share with you. He said no. If he wants to share, he will,'\" she wrote. Her words earned her dirty looks from other parents, according to Kolberg, likely for going against a commonly held lesson — that kids should always be told to share their things. \"Whose manners are lacking here,\" Kolberg wondered. \"The person reluctant to give his 3 toys away to 6 strangers, or the 6 strangers demanding to be given something that doesn't belong to them, even when the owner is obviously uncomfortable?\" People seem to resonate with her message, which has more than 200,000 shares as of writing. She goes on to claim that we should be teaching children how to function like adults, who would never ask a stranger to use something that doesn't belong to them. She uses a sandwich as an example (what stranger would ask another stranger for their sandwich?) but the same could be said of technology or other objects comparable to Carson's toys. But the big question here is: should we actually be treating children like adults? Learning to share can be an important lesson for kids, who will need to grow up knowing that it's sometimes okay to lend other people their stuff or to collaborate on projects. And it's easy to see why those boys were so excited that someone brought new toys to the playground. The playground is a place where kids go to play together, even kids who don't already know each other, and someone who brings new toys offers even more exciting things to play with. But still, Kolberg's post makes an important point about allowing yourself to say \"no.\" The issue here might not that Carson should never learn to share — he should and has — but that he needed to say \"no\" in the moment. Kolberg wrote in her post that she and Carson were meeting a friend and their daughter at the park that day. Carson brought his toys to share with the little girl — who we can see in the picture Kolberg attached with her post — so that they could play together. It's clear from the photo that Carson knows how to share, and is happy to, but that he simply didn't want to ruin his surprise by sharing with those boys first. He needed to say \"no\" to them so that he could play with his friend. So while Kolberg told Carson that day at the park that he doesn't have to share his things every time someone wants to share them, her post doesn't really seem to be about sharing at all. It's about learning to say \"no\" when it's important for your own well-being, which is a lesson more of us could use. \"While I do know some adults who clearly never learned how to share as children, I know far more who don't know how to say no to people, or how to set boundaries, or how to practice self-care,\" Kolberg wrote. \"Myself included.\"\n",

            "Topic: Keeping Legal Drinking Age At 21 Saves 900 Lives Yearly: Study\n",
            "Paragraph: Laws that maintain the legal drinking age at 21 save lives on the road, and protect young people from other hazards of drinking, according to a new review of studies. Researchers examined the evidence from studies conducted since 2006, and found that laws that make it illegal for people under age 21 to drink are linked to lower rates of drunk-driving deaths among young people. Researchers also found that current drinking restrictions have not resulted in more binge drinking among teens, as some have suggested. \"Recent research ...has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths,\" the researchers wrote in their study published today (Feb. 24) in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. \"The evidence is clear that there would be consequences if we lowered the legal drinking age,\" said study researcher William DeJong of Boston University School of Public Health. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health] U.S. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. The benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated. Advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision. They also argue that the current laws haven't led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption. However, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents. In fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Teen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the Federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21. During that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25. Looking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea. On the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption. In one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said they'd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states. Researchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced. Instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said. \"Clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law — and advertise that fact to students — student drinking declines,\" DeJong said. \"Some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them,\" DeJong said. \"But it really is the case that enforcement works.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Tyler Joseph of the band Twenty One Pilots performs in concert during the Radio 104.5 9th Birthday Show at BB&T Pavilion on Saturday, June 11, 2016, in Camden, N.J. (Photo by Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP) Twenty One Pilots are having one of the best years of any act in music, and this week, things got just a bit better. The alternative duo currently has on the Hot 100, which is a very rare feat. By managing to have two such massive hits at the same time, the up-and-coming pairing joins some of most beloved company in history. According to Billboard , only two other rock acts in history have managed to place a pair of singles in the top five on the Hot 100 in the same week: Elvis Presley, and The Beatles. Twenty One Pilots are having one of the best years of any act in music, and this week, things got just a bit better. The alternative duo currently has two singles in the top five Twenty One Pilots achieve this rare feat thanks to the success of both \"Heathens\" and \"Ride,\" which audiences have been loving for a while now. \"Heathens\" is up first, this week placing at No. 4. The song, which has quickly become the Twenty One Pilots achieve this rare feat thanks to the success of both \"Heathens\" and \"Ride,\" which audiences have been loving for a while now. \"Heathens\" is up first, this week placing at No. 4. The song, which has quickly become the biggest hit to be released off the chart-topping Suicide Squad soundtrack, is likely to stick around in the region for some time, considering the fact that it is continuing to grow on radio, and it soundtrack, is likely to stick around in the region for some time, considering the fact that it is continuing to grow on radio, and it won a VMA on Sunday night for Best Rock Video. Immediately behind that tune is \"Ride,\" which is taken from the band’s own Blurryface album, which hit the top spot early last year. Elvis was the first artist that primarily worked in the rock and roll genre to score simultaneous top five hits. The King sent his singles into the region back in 1959, when both \"I Need Your Love Tonight\" and \"(Now and Then There’s) A Fool Such as I\" managed to enter the region at the same time. Just a few years later, The Beatles were able to do the same, and the next few years would prove to be exceptionally successful for the Fab Four. The Beatles had at least two songs in the top five on 18 separate occasions in 1964, 1965, 1966, and again in 1969. In addition to making it to the same level as The Beatles and Elvis (at least in one regard), Twenty One Pilots have also become just the third duo in history to chart simultaneous top five smashes in one week, though with this piece of charting history, they aren’t in the company of fellow rock artists. Two hip-hop duos have also managed this specific feat, which makes Twenty One Pilots the first rockers to join the exclusive club. OutKast was the first group to do so back in 2003 and 2004 when their hits \"Hey Ya!\" and \"I Like The Way You Move (ft. Sleepy Brown)\" both spent an incredible 14 weeks together in the highest region on the Hot 100. Just three years ago, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis repeated the success with their hits \"Thrift Shop (ft. Wanz)\" and \"Can’t Hold Us (ft. Ray Dalton),\" though they didn’t last nearly as long as OutKast.\n",

            "Paragraph: Check the date, check it twice... Nope, okay. It’s definitely not April Fools’ Day. Instead, this is an idea plucked straight out of some weird fantastical future. BAE Systems, a UK-based defense company, has unveiled plans to \"grow\" drones for warfare in a chemical process. Details are few and far between, but in a statement, the company said this relies on a machine called the \"Chemputer\". This would involve making parts from the molecular level, rather than physically making parts like a regular 3D-printer, with shape-shifting chemicals. The statement goes on to add that this will be done via \"speeding up evolutionary processes\", whatever that means. But the company says this would enable aircraft to be built in weeks, rather than the years of construction it takes at the moment. In a somewhat futuristic video, BAE seems to envisage using large vats in which autonomous drones could be grown via this process. Other parts for large manned aircraft could apparently be produced in this manner. \"The world of military and civil aircraft is constantly evolving and it's been exciting to work with scientists and engineers outside BAE Systems and to consider how some unique British technologies could tackle the military threats of the future,\" said Professor Nick Colosimo, a BAE Systems Global Engineering Fellow, in the statement. It certainly sounds rather, uh, fantastic. But as Mashable points out, BAE has precedent for carrying out some of its bold ideas, such as the heads-up display (HUD) used by military pilots. Nonetheless, this latest idea certainly seems to be pushing into the realms of science fiction. But who knows, maybe drones of the future will indeed be grown in giant futuristic vats of goo. Just don’t come complaining to us when the robot uprising begins.\n",

            "Paragraph: Under Armour Inc., the maker of athletic clothing and gear, is acquiring the MyFitnessPal and Endomondo applications for a total of about $560 million in a bid to become the world’s biggest tracker of fitness information. The two apps will complement the company’s current software -- MapMyFitness and UA Record -- giving it a total of 120 million users, according to a statement Wednesday. The company also reported better-than-projected results for the fourth quarter. The move is part of Under Armour’s efforts to lock in customers with technology and services -- rather than just shoes and T-shirts. It bought MapMyFitness Inc. for $150 million in 2013, playing catch-up with competitors like Nike Inc., which was a pioneer in activity tracking. \"There is an overall halo effect,\" for the Under Armour brand, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank said in an interview. The applications also generate revenue with premium versions and advertising, he said. Under Armour shares gained 1 percent to $73.57 at the close in New York. The stock increased 41 percent during the past 12 months, outpacing the 16 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Deal Terms Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. MyFitnessPal, based in San Francisco, offers a program that helps monitor fitness goals. Under Armour agreed to pay $475 million for the business, which has more than 80 million registered users. Endomondo is a Copenhagen-based social network with its own mobile app devoted to fitness with 20 million members -- mostly outside the U.S. Under Armour completed its acquisition of that company last month for $85 million. Both apps, along with MapMyFitness, will automatically sync to UA Record, so users can track all their performances and data from one place. Plank said he envisions UA Record, which has a mobile application and was announced last month, as a daily health dashboard. Nike has a similar digital platform under the Nike+ brand. Over the years, it has ranged from mobile applications to watches that track a user’s runs to the Fuelband bracelet. Now Nike looks like it’s shifting away from hardware. After trying to build digital products on its own, Under Armour realized it would be easier to look for acquisitions, Plank said. These deals also helped the company acquire tech talent, he said. Under Armour has no plans to make its own wearable devices because it’s too difficult and costly, Plank said. The company has made three acquisitions in its history and they’ve all been to help it build an online following through digital tools. \"It’s incredibly difficult\" to keep trying to make a \"better mousetrap every six months,\" he said. HTC Partnership Under Armour announced a licensing deal with HTC Corp. last month in which HTC devices will exclusively use UA Record to track activity, Plank said. The first HTC device under this agreement is expected to be a smartwatch, a person familiar with the matter said last month. Plank founded Under Armour as an apparel company in the 1990s, making workout shirts from synthetic materials that soaked up sweat better than cotton. After the idea took off, Under Armour maintained growth by pushing into categories such as shoes and casual wear. The company, now the largest U.S. sporting-goods maker after Nike, also has expanded distribution overseas. Sales Growth That’s helped Under Armour double sales about every three years. The company expects the rate of growth to slow to 22 percent this year as it enters fewer international markets, its lowest rate since 2009. The slowdown is putting more pressure on the company to expand its customer base with products such as the mobile apps. In the fourth quarter, net income rose 37 percent to $87.7 million, or 40 cents a share, from $64.2 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. That topped the 39 cents that analysts had estimated on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 31 percent to $895.2 million, beating the $848.7 million estimated by analysts.\n",

This is the biggest out of the three DLC packs released so far and Bethesda has claimed that it’s their largest DLC pack landmass wise.

It is certainly the biggest when it comes to Fallout games, no other DLC released for any Fallout game comes close, but when compared to another Bethesda developed DLC for Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, it isn’t quite the biggest. Shivering Isles took almost 50% more time when compared to this DLC pack, with the final time coming to around 45 mins mark. To be fair, it’s still quite a large map and Bethesda’s really delivered a meaty DLC pack in the form of Far Harbor.

            "Paragraph: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The giant panda is a global icon that up until recently was considered to be endangered They're cute, they're cuddly and they've just been brought back from the brink of extinction. We're talking about the giant panda, a global icon that's just been taken off the endangered list, largely due to Chinese conservation efforts. But how exactly did they do it? It's all about the bamboo China has been trying for years to increase the population of the giant panda. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bamboo makes up for 99% of a panda's diet The bears, China's national icon, were once widespread throughout southern and eastern China but, due to expanding human populations and development, are now limited to areas that still contain bamboo forests. The success is due to Chinese efforts to recreate and repopulate bamboo forests. Bamboo makes up some 99% of their diet, without which they are likely to starve. Pandas must eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. There are now an estimated total of 2,060 pandas, of which 1,864 are adults - a number which has seen their status changed from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\", on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List. \"It's all about restoring the habitats,\" Craig Hilton-Taylor, Head of the IUCN Red List, told the BBC. \"Just by restoring the panda's habitat, that's given them back their space and made food available to them.\" A loss of habitats was what caused the number of pandas to drop to just over 1,200 in the 1980s, according to Mr Hilton-Taylor. \"You need to get the bamboo back and slowly the numbers will start to creep back,\" he said. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are now an estimated total of 2,060 pandas Ginette Hemley, senior vice-president for wildlife conservation at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) agreed. \"The Chinese have done a great job in investing in panda habitats, expanding and setting up new reserves,\" said Ms Hemley. \"They are a wonderful example of what can happen when a government is committed to conservation.\" Yet this success could be short-lived. Climate change is predicted to wipe out more than one-third of the panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years. Image copyright Wildlife Reserves Singapore Image caption Pandas must eat up to 38kg worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs \"With the change in climate, it's going to get too hot for the bamboo to grow,\" Mr Hilton-Taylor explained. \"Giant pandas are very dependent on bamboo for food and with a loss in bamboo, it's not looking very promising for them.\" So is captive breeding the answer? Many zoos and Chinese facilities have placed their bets on breeding giant pandas in captivity, sometimes using artificial insemination methods. Baby giant panda twins were on Sunday born in an Atlanta zoo - their mother had been artificially inseminated.

But why has the panda got everyone so obsessed? The Tibetan antelope is another animal that has also been delisted on the IUCN's red list, yet more focus has been placed on the panda, which has come to be seen as an icon for animal protection efforts.

            "Paragraph: Cabin crew often argue that the job is not as glamorous as it's made out to be, but you certainly wouldn't believe it to look at these flight attendants. Sharing their enviable lifestyles on social media under the hashtag #cabincrewlife staff from airlines such as Emirates and Norwegian Air have glossy Instagram profiles, jet set lifestyles and beach bodies to rival any self respecting celebrity.  And it's perhaps no surprise that many have sideline careers as models, bodybuilders and personal trainers.  Aeroflot hostess Victoria Tzuranova for instance uses her stopovers in locations such as Israel, Thailand and Bali to flaunt her figure on the beach in skimpy swimwear and show off her eye-watering flexibility with a spot of yoga.  When she's not serving drinks and snacks in the air, the fitness fanatic has a second job as a presenter on the Russian Music Box channel. Her Emirates compatriot Georgia Nielsen from Melbourne has built up an impressive 35,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her glamorous travel shots and sexy bikini snaps.  The hostess admits that while there are downsides to the job, she often jets off to another city just to have dinner to make the most of her days off.   'Put simply, just like every other job there are ups and downs - jetlag and sleep management are the biggest issues as you can imagine but over time you learn how to best manage this, everyone's body is different!' she told Instagram fans.  'It can be hard work but the opportunities and experiences you get out of it far outweigh any negative sides and I am very lucky that I don't seem to have too much issue balancing everything out.  'I try to make the most of days off by either going away for the night, or doing ridiculous things like flying to Monaco or Istanbul for dinner, which if I plan properly can cost less than going out for dinner in Dubai!  'Those sorts of experiences I just could never do living a normal 9-5 life in Australia, so I am extremely lucky. 'Everyone has different ways of being cabin crew though. I really enjoy it.' Georgia is by no means the only one enjoying a five star lifestyle while jetting around the world.  Norwegian Airlines' Rainam combines photos of her flashing her long legs in her uniform with plenty of summery shots in skimpy bikinis.  But it's not just female flight attendants turning their followers green with envy.  Their male colleagues are equally eager to show off their aspirational lives on social media.  Daniel Najarro Smith combines his career as a flight attendant for Monarch with a spot of modelling that gives him the chance to show off his toned physique. He may be the pilot rather than cabin crew, but Brazilian pilot Hudson Sá has also won a legion of female fans thanks to his handsome snaps from the cockpit.  And when he's not jetting around the world, he likes to pose in the tightest of swimming trunks as he enjoys breaks on the beach.  Colombian pilot Tavo, who has an impressive 21,000 follower on Instagram, also likes to flaunt his chiselled body when he's not busy in the cockpit.\n",

Emergency personnel eventually sent 7 people to the hospital from the abortion facility. Police later determined the dangerous substance was none other than baby food. Here’s more: Seven people were taken to the hospital for evaluation, one declined medical assistance, and 34 others who were in the building were evacuated, Sarasota police said in a statement shortly after 12 p.m. local time. There is no criminal investigation underway and staffers are expected to re-enter the building later today. Police were summoned around 10:30 a.m. local time when people in the building were experiencing shortness of breath, WFLA reported. In a statement, Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida confirmed no patients were on the site.

            "Paragraph: Wikipedia A new study has provided an updated theory about how the dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago. A paper published in the Scientific Reports journal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the Earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports The Independent. Researchers – from Japan’s Meteorological Research Institute and Tohuku Univeristy – now believe the asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, hitting massive oil deposits and sending a blanket of thick black smoke into the atmosphere, engulfing the planet. The amount of sunlight fell by a huge 85 per cent, causing the Earth to cool by as much as 16 degrees Celsius on land for about three years. Also, rainfall would have fallen by roughly 80 per cent causing extreme and devastating droughts. The researchers wrote: Small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer – dinosaurs did not. These different habitats would have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival. Wikimedia Experts had previously wondered why dinosaurs had died out while other reptiles – like the ancestors of crocodiles – had survived. The accepted theory was that the impact caused vapours of sulphuric acid in the sky, which reflected sunlight, leading to global darkness, near-freezing conditions and widespread acid rain. However, the team from Tohuku said: If this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct. It is thought that only 12 per cent of life on land lived through the aftermath of the asteroid impact, whereas 90 per cent of freshwater species managed to survive. Dark times. Literally.\n",

            "Paragraph: Most things aren't really the end of the world, but one-third of Americans who were surveyed believe that the Syria conflict is an indication that our days are numbered. A biblical passage which prophesies the destruction of Damascus and links it to the coming of Armageddon is leading many people to think that the current violence is an apocalyptic omen. A LifeWay Research poll asked 1,001 people if they agreed with the statement, \"I believe the battles in Syria are all part of the prophecies of the Book of Revelation,\" and 32 percent of them said yes. Twenty-six percent agreed with the assertion that \"U.S. military intervention in Syria might lead to the Battle of Armageddon that’s spoken about in the Book of Revelation.\" Gender played a role in responses, as women were more likely than men to draw a corollary between Biblical prophecy and the current situation in Syria. Location and income also skewed the results, with Southerners and members of households making less than $25,000 per year being much more likely to connect Syria with the end of days. In addition, one in five people polled agreed with the statement, \"I believe the world will end in my lifetime.\" The Rev. Mark Hitchcock of Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Okla., speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times \"want to know that God is in charge. They want to know that someone has his hands on the wheel,\" according to LifeWay. Though he believes the Bible does predict future events in the Middle East, the author of The End: A Complete Overview of Bible Prophecy and the End of Days said that he \"does not think the trouble in Syria was predicted in the Bible.\" Isaiah 17:1 is one of the passages most frequently referenced when relating Syria to the end of the world. It states: The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. (King James version) Ed Stetzer, president of LifeWay Research, was surprised by the results of the survey. He said that previous U.S. military actions like the war in Afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on Bosnia \"didn't get the same reaction.\" However, Syria's shared border with Israel, as well as the explicit Biblical mention of Damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses. Stetzer said that he could see why attaching Biblical significance to the Syria conflict would appeal to many Christians, because, \"For Christians, the end of the world doesn’t mean despair. The end is really a new beginning.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: We asked three experts for all the precautions you should take before mouth-to-butt contact happens. Q: I have a partner who is infinitely giving in the sack. He rocks my socks off. He's always so busy doing things to/for me that I get too distracted to do much for him. I would love to change this. One thing he's mentioned once or twice is that he'd like a rim job. In theory I would love to do this if it would give him as much pleasure as he has given me, but I have a few hesitations. Namely, if it is safe/healthy to do this without a barrier. We are monogamous and I'm on the Pill so we don't otherwise use condoms or dental dams for any bedroom activities. My googling turns up many different answers from sexperts and normal people, and I don't know how to separate the information wheat from the chaff. The more cautious sources indicate that one should use a dental dam (with some lube on the receiver's side of the dam). Many other sources act like this is an unnecessarily uptight precaution and having a basically clean body is good enough. I'm not able to discern if the idea of using a dental dam in this scenario is like the recommendation to use a dental dam for cunnilingus or a condom for fellatio, i.e., if it's what \"they\" should say to give you safer sex information, but in reality many monogamous couples who have been tested for STIs are unlikely to use these and they will (usually) be OK. In a nutshell, my question is this: Is it reasonably safe to perform unprotected analingus on someone (with whom you are monogamous) who is not experiencing intestinal distress and has showered that day? Or is there always a greater risk for some kind of illness from gastrointestinal bacteria and one should always use a barrier? Signed, Would Like to Please Hi, Would Like to Please! Thanks so much for your question. To help answer it, we checked in with a few experts from various fields, including: New York City sex therapist Dr. Stephen Snyder, proctologist Dr. David Rosenfeld, and Dr. Dennis Fortenberry, professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, who specializes in the research of health risk behaviors and STDs. Here's what they had to say: Actually, analingus (or rim jobs, rimming, oral anal, tossing salad... whichever term you’d prefer) is reasonably safe to perform without a barrier method — at least in your VERY specific circumstances. First of all, kudos for putting so much thought into this request. It's awesome that you're looking for ways to ~give back~ to your partner and that you want to make sure you're both being super safe. You guys are like the model for healthy experimenting in a consensual, monogamous relationship. Seriously, you rock. Anyways... Now, we're not saying that rim jobs are totally without risk, but if you're taking the right precautions you should be able to perform unprotected analingus on your partner and be confident that you're being as safe as possible, says Snyder. Here are the major things to keep in mind: STIs can definitely be transmitted via rim jobs, so make sure you’ve both been tested recently. Pretty much every STI can be passed along this way. \"Not necessarily because the anus or rectum is infected, but because it's part of the skin that connects the entire genital area, and some of those organisms may simply be moving around,\" says Fortenberry. Hypothetically, this could be one way to spread chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, herpes, syphilis, and even HIV. That said, it's also possible to spread these through unprotected oral sex and penetrative sex, which you said you've been doing. \"I'm not sure that the exposure that you would get from direct contact with the anus would be that much different than with oral sex or sex,\" Fortenberry says. Hepatitis A and B can also be transmitted this way, so be sure that you've both been vaccinated, says Snyder. If you haven't been — or you're not sure — you can also get tested and vaccinated as an adult. So as long as you've both recently been tested for STIs, you've both gotten your hepatitis vaccines, and you're both completely monogamous, you shouldn't have to worry about this stuff. OK, so there’s obviously bacteria down there — but it's maybe not as bad as you think. For most healthy people with normal bowel habits, the bacteria down there wouldn't be much of an issue, says Rosenfeld. Important: This is considering that neither of you have any strains of harmful illness-causing bacteria or parasites. More on that later! Basically there's bacteria everywhere — in your anus, in your genitals, in your mouth — and getting this run-of-the-mill bacteria in your mouth wouldn't typically do much damage, Rosenfeld says. In fact, bacteria from the anus could actually do more damage in your vagina than in your mouth, since it can lead to a UTI there. (That's why you should never go from anal penetration to vaginal penetration without changing the condom or washing up.) Interestingly, it's less likely for men to get UTIs this way, but still, it's a good idea to perform oral sex on his penis before you move to his anus (rather than the other way around), says Rosenfeld. BUT if there’s any chance your partner might be sick or experiencing any gastrointestinal distress, skip it. If your partner could have any bacteria that can potentially spread an infection through the fecal oral route (like salmonella, E. coli, C. difficile, etc.) or any parasites (maybe from a recent trip abroad), that can make rim jobs VERY risky. While most people would know if they had a bug like this (because they would feel either a little or A LOT sick), some might just think their stomach was being weird. So if there's any chance your partner might have something like this, don't perform it without a safe barrier method like a dental dam or a condom cut in half. Also, you probably want to talk about his poop habits before you go down there without a barrier. Even just irregular bowel movements could pose a risk for rimming, like if their stool hasn't been totally solid, they're going more or less frequently, or they've had some anal itching lately. These could all be signs that they're not having normal bowel movements, which could mean extra bacteria left hanging around the anus, says Rosenfeld. The goal would be smooth, solid stool that doesn't leave anything behind when you wipe, he explains. That's a sign it's essentially pretty clean back there and you would just need to do some normal washing to make sure there's no lingering germs. (If that's not the case, he'll probably want to check with his doctor about what he can do to become more regular.) Obviously, this means you and your partner should have a conversation about his poops if you want to do this without a barrier method. Hey, it's better than going in there blind, right? He should be really, really clean down there. Like, really clean. Washing with a detachable shower head would be best, but just water and a gentle washcloth should do the trick, says Rosenfeld. Body washes can actually be very irritating on the anus, but if it doesn't cause him any irritation and you both prefer it, you can use a gentle soap. As far as knowing how clean is clean enough, that might be a judgment call. Again, make sure to take everything we've said into consideration here: his STI status, his health, his bathroom habits, etc. Then, if it passes a visual test and a sniff test, you should be in the clear, says Snyder. But no matter what, only do what you’re comfortable with. Obviously there's nothing wrong with using a barrier method while rimming if that makes you more comfortable. Just like using a condom during sex, knowing you have that extra protection can sometimes make you feel more liberated and less inhibited. So if that's the case, you can place a dental dam or a cut-in-half condom on your partner's anus (with some lube on the side that touches him). You can also ease your way into butt play by first blowing warm air on the area or using your fingers and some lube, suggests Snyder. There are tons of nerve endings around there, so just go slow and ask your partner to tell you what feels good. And if you both want to try it without a barrier, make sure to have a conversation about it first, because we talked about a lot of precautions that you'll want to keep in mind. The important thing to remember is that it's reasonably safe under the specific circumstances we discussed above, but it's not entirely without risk. Also, you still want to make sure there's a high degree of trust and communication between you and your partner. \"No sex act is 100% risk-free,\" says Snyder. \"So make sure it's in the context of a trusting relationship where you can rely on the other's honesty.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: We’ve all heard that we shouldn’t do it: inviting your dog into your bed. People believe it’s dirty, and it’s just not good for you. People have been saying it for years. But, what if we told you that maybe that isn’t entirely true. There are actual health benefits to letting your four-legged best friend spend the night, and it isn’t just you who’s better for all that cuddle time. It’s better for your dog, too! And who doesn’t want to do everything they can to make sure their little one is as happy as possible? So to all you dog lovers who love snuggling up with their warm, fluffy buddy at the end of the day, keep doing what you’re doing. Chances are, you’ll sleep better at night and we all know that better sleep leads to a better day. It really is a win-win situation for everyone involved!  #1: They Give You Comfort Whether it’s their warm body or rhythmic breathing, there’s just something so comforting about a dog. They make your bed feel even cozier! #2: They Fight Insomnia Their presence promotes calm, stress relief, and a feeling of safety. So, basically, they take away all of the things that keep you up at night! #3: Snuggling With Them Relieves Stress And Anxiety As therapy dogs have shown, a pooch’s presence is a great stress reliever. Their positive outlook seems to be contagious, and their attentive nature can be very reassuring. #4: They Provide Warmth Their warm bodies and tendency to curl up as close to their humans as possible work as a little radiator in the bed. While this can be tough in the summer, who doesn’t love a little bit of natural warmth on a chilly night? #5: They Help Fight Depression One thing that dogs offer without question is unconditional love. For someone battling depression, this type of connection can feel hard to come by. To receive it, with no questions asked, can work wonders during a particularly tough time. #6: They Make You Feel Safe Knowing that there is another presence watching over you when you’re at your most vulnerable is such a comforting feeling. Their super hearing and tendency to bark at strangers are all factors in this. #7: It's Good For Your Dog, Too There’s nothing in the world that your dog loves more than you, so allowing them to spend that extra snuggle time will make their day. They receive comfort from you in the same way that you do from them, so this sleep arrangement is good for everyone!\n",

            "Paragraph: This touching story gives a whole new meaning to \"’till death do us part.\" After 63 years of loving marriage, Henry and Jeanette De Lange passed away just minutes after each other at ages 86 and 87, respectively. Jeanette had been battling Alzheimer’s for several years and was admitted to a local nursing home in 2011. Her elderly husband, who struggled with prostate cancer for months years before his death, visited her often multiple times a day in the nursing home. But it wasn’t until July 31st, 2016 that the De Lange family was told their parents’ health was declining rapidly and that they should get to the hospital as soon as possible. About 7-8 weeks before, the VA told Korean War vet Henry that there was nothing more they could do to treat the rapidly growing prostate cancer. At that point, Henry requested to be put in the local nursing home. Thanks to the kindness of the staff, Henry and Jeanette were placed in the same room and happily reunited. The De Lange family told KSFY news that their parents’ last weeks were significantly sweeter because they were able to be together day in and day out. On the July afternoon their parents would pass, two of the five De Lange kids were present. Originally the nurses said it was their father who would go first. \"[The doctor] said your dad’s pulse is worse. I wonder if he’ll go first,\" Lee explained to KSFY. \"About five minutes later, the aid said I think your mom will go very soon. It was 5:05 p.m. at that point.\" As she was passing, the two brothers present read aloud a favorite Psalm, Psalm 103, which they didn’t even finish before their mother peacefully passed. Son Keith went up to their resting father and told him that his wife had \"gone to heaven\" and that if he wanted to stop fighting and go with her, it was okay. \"It’s one of those things you don’t pray for, because that just seems mean,\" Lee said. \"But you couldn’t ask for anything more beautiful.\" Both sons reported that their dad opened his eyes for the first time in hours, looked intently over at his loving wife, and laid back down. 20 minutes later, Henry De Lange passed away, just minutes after Jeanette. About 25 minutes later, Lee happened to turn around and look at the clock on the nursing home wall – it said 5:30. Thinking that was strange, Lee checked his watch; it was actually five to six. The clock had frozen at the exact time his father had passed away, 25 minutes previously. This is something that the De Lange family just has not been able to explain – and, truly, it is an extraordinary ending to an already tear-jerking story. The De Lange’s firmly believe that this bizarre circumstance was a sign from God, letting the grieving children know that this was the right time for their beloved parents to both pass. What an amazing story. This is an inspiring testament to the power of true love. What do you think about this beautifully sad story? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.\n",

Four years later, something rather incredible happened, and it doesn’t happen very often. Erica was pregnant again... with twins. That’s right — for a second time in less than five years, a second set of twins was on the horizon! And this time, they didn’t want to know the sex of the twins until the day of the delivery. In November 2014, Weston and Erica headed off to the hospital for induced labor. Doctors had to break Erica’s water because she was full-term at 38 weeks and a few days. Like a proud husband and father, Weston decided to document the big day. He filmed everything from the drive to the hospital and up until the magical moment the babies were delivered. The couple was surprisingly cool, calm and collected the whole way through. En route to the hospital, Erica looks at her husband and jokingly asks, \"Are you ready to have five kids?\" It’s too late to turn back now! As it turned out, Weston was more than prepared. He popped open the trunk to reveal a slew of electronics to capture the memories, like computers, an iPad, and a camera fitted with a GoPro. The result is a heartwarming and personal video that takes viewers along on this crazy ride. Weston says, \"The labor was insanely quick at only three hours from water breakage to newborns.\" My favorite moment is when the nurses break into a chorus of cheers after revealing the twins’ genders to Erica. Absolutely beautiful. Please enjoy this sweet video, and SHARE it with your friends on Facebook! Note: This birth video is not graphic at all, so anyone can watch. .\n",

            "Paragraph: With Battlefield 1 producing groundbreaking features and currently living up to its hype, there is still one thing that each Battlefield game has been lacking: female soldiers in multiplayer. And it doesn’t look like EA’s next installment will entertain that idea, either. With popular shooters such as Call of Duty and Overwatch including female characters in their multiplayer formats, it’s become quite the norm to play as a woman with guns blazing. However, the Battlefield franchise has never provided this feature, and Battlefield 1 will be no different. (Note that this is regards to online multiplayer only, because there is a playable female character in the story mode.) What’s really entertaining is the reason behind this decision. Originally, females were going to be integrated as playable multiplayer characters, but then the idea was scrapped due to boys not finding it believable. Former DICE coder, Amanda Coget, took to Twitter in order to discuss how the conversation went down. Even though female soldiers in WWI was not a common thing, it happened. And even though Battlefield is more realistic with its play style in comparison to other shooters, it’s still a video game. There is a ton of room for interpretation when it comes to developing battles and fighting because despite how realistic a game is, it’s still pretty fictional. (I mean come on, respawning multiple times in a match is realistic, but playing as a female soldier isn’t?) I’ve never classified myself as a feminist by any means, but this is ridiculous. It’s not upsetting that Battlefield 1 won’t have female soldiers (in multiplayer), but it’s highly offensive that they are catering to boys that wouldn’t find the idea believable. The concept is understandable, but the reasoning is not. This isn’t the first time the game attempted to accommodate to the less informed consumer. EA originally ditched the idea of a World War I setting because they were concerned that kids didn’t know that it actually happened. UPDATE 6/15/16: I just want to clear the air regarding the reasoning behind this article. It is not to start a debate about social equality, women’s rights, or anything of that nature. I don’t care if I have to play a game as a man, woman, alien, worm, or even a piece of chewed up bubble gum; I just like to play video games, regardless of the characters available. This article was written to simply state that it appeared that Battlefield 1 initially wanted to include women in their multiplayer for the first time, but ditched the idea later in order to appease their supposed target audience, which happens to be younger boys.\n",

            "Topic: Minnesota Wants To Legalize Medical Marijuana, But Police Agencies Are In The Way\n",
            "Paragraph: Minnesota will consider passing legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana, but police agencies are standing in the way. A bill in the state House of Representatives would legalize the possession and use of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for people suffering from a range of medical conditions including cancer, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder or any other medical condition approved by the state Commissioner of Health. Patients would first need to obtain an ID card by getting written certification from a doctor, says measure HF 1818, which was introduced by Rep. Carly Melin (D-Hibbing) last spring. There's evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill. A similar effort was approved by the Minnesota House and Senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-Governor Tim Pawlenty (R). This time around, Governor Mark Dayton (D) says he'd sign the bill -- but not without the support of Minnesota law enforcement agencies. So far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill. Their opposition, according to a report in local paper St. Cloud Times, is based on fears that marijuana's medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drug's availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions. The head of one police agency put it another way: He openly admitted that he was worried legalizing weed for medical purposes might make it harder for police to get federal drug war dollars. Minnesota receives millions in anti-drug money from the White House every year, and asset seizures from drug raids have become an integral part of state police budgets, Politics In Minnesota reported earlier this month. As a result, Melin has said she may draft a compromise bill to legalize marijuana extracts in pill or liquid form. While such a law would be much more restrictive in terms of which patients could receive cannabis for treatment, some law enforcement agencies have said they might be open to such a measure. \"Obviously any compromise ... [is] disheartening for patients,\" Melin told the La Crosse Tribune. \"But we’re facing reality around here, which is if we can get anything done there’s going to have to be compromise.\" Minnesota voters, on the other hand, have shown they overwhelmingly support legalizing medical marijuana in all its forms. A St. Cloud State University poll from last year found 76 percent support for the issue. HF 1818 has been referred to the Health and Human Services Policy Committee and is scheduled to have a hearing Wednesday evening. Melin said her compromise bill could be ready as soon as next week.\n",

            "Paragraph: A Democratic presidential candidate has not won a majority of votes in Nebraska for more than 50 years. But on Thursday, Hillary Clinton’s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state. The advertising buy is focused on Nebraska’s second congressional district, and includes two ads about Clinton’s advocacy for children. It is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there’s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district. The second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska. The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district’s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average—and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters. The electoral college’s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon—or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama—are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. They predictably vote Democratic or Republican. But in Nebraska and Maine—the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district—there is more room for the parties to maneuver. They can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright. It’s an electoral strategy that Donald Trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. This week he campaigned in Maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a Democrat. He held a rally in Bangor in the state’s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural. Clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you’d expect: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevda, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina. In those states, as well as in her Nebraska ad buy, Clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the 1990s. These are the two ads that will be playing in Nebraska.\n",

            "Paragraph: Urgent action is needed to control the use of antibiotics before they cease to work, leaving a number of major conditions untreatable and causing \"terrible human and economic cost\", a major study has warned. Resistance to antibiotics is growing at such an alarming rate that they risk losing effectiveness entirely meaning medical procedures such as caesarean sections, joint replacements and chemotherapy could soon become too dangerous to perform. Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report’s authors warn. Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called ‘superbugs’ such as MRSA develop. Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further. In the UK, 45 per cent of all antibiotics are given to livestock. Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe 4 show all Antibiotic-resistant infections spread through Europe 1/4 K. pneumoniaeis one of the toughest super-infections Alamy 2/4 Amoxicillin, the commonest antibiotic prescribed by GPs 3/4 Antibiotic resistance cycle 4/4 Antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe The report is the result of a two year long review of the use of antibiotics undertaken by economist and former Goldman Sachs Asset Managemet chairman Lord Jim O’Neill. The review was commissioned by the Government amid growing concerns about the use of the medicines in the UK. Lord O'Neill said tackling antimicrobial resistance is 'absolutely essential' (PA) It calls for urgent action to halt the growing use of antibiotics: \"to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world would otherwise face.\" Among his recommendations, Lord O’Neill calls for a public awareness campaign on the harms of antibiotic use, for restrictions to be placed on the use of some critical antibiotics and a tax on the drugs to be introduced for livestock use. The report estimates that without action now, the cost of the antibiotic failure will be $100 trillion between before 2050. Antibiotics crisis is global Lord O’Neill said of the findings: \"My review not only makes it clear how big a threat antimicrobial resistance is to the world, with a potential 10 million people dying each year by 2050, but also now sets out a workable blueprint for bold, global action to tackle this challenge. The actions I’m setting out today are ambitious in their scope- but this is a problem which it is well within our grasp to solve if we take action now... to avoid the terrible human and economic costs of resistance that the world will otherwise face.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed the report’s recommendations, saying: \"Lord O’Neill’s review provides a stark warning that unless we take global action, antimicrobial resistance will become a greater threat to mankind than cancer currently is. It is not just a threat to health but also to the world economy. Apart from the moral case for action, the economic cost of failing to act is too great to contemplate.\" Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, who previously warned that the UK is facing an \"apocalyptic scenario\" over antimicrobial drug use also welcomed the report, describing the recommendations as \"challenging.\" Antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, stopping infections. They transformed medicine when they were first used early last century and have contributed to the near eradication of a number of serious conditions including tuberculosis and syphilis. An estimated 40 million antibiotics are prescribed in the UK every year, of which the health regulator Nice claims 10 million are unnecessary prescriptions.\n",

            "Paragraph: The adoption of wind and solar for electricity generation around the world is happening at a growing pace, and the likelihood is that it will displace hydrocarbons in fifteen to twenty years (decades sooner than Big Coal, Big Oil and Big Gas expect). Here are some stories illustrating that stepped-up pace. Germany’s wind power output is up by a third in the first five months of 2015 over the same period the previous year. In part, some offshore projects that had been delayed have started coming on line, adding 3 gigawatts of capacity. In part, Germany’s government plans to reduce incentives for wind and has already done so for solar, on the theory that these are now mature industries. The planned changes caused owners of planned wind turbine plants to rush to finish them so as to benefit from the more generous current policies. In 2015, it is expected that for the first time, Germany will generate more electricity via renewables like wind and solar than by its aging set of 8 nuclear reactors. The cost of electricity in Germany is historically low this year as a result of the wind and solar installations in the country, and is half what it is in Britain. China added 5 gigawatts of new solar capacity in the first three months of 2015! That is nearly equivalent to all the solar installations ever built in Spain. China is going for 17 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2015. That will make it about tied with Germany, currently the leading solar power in the world, with 33 gigawatts of installed coapacity. The state of Maharashtra in India has announced a plan to nearly double its power generation from renewables over the next five years, with plans to have 7.5 gigawatts of solar energy and 5 gigawatts of wind by 2020. At the moment, 9% of the state’s energy comes from renewables,and this plan would bring the total to 15%. The plan is revenue-neutral, in part because of expected help from the Indian federal government. Maharashtra lies on the country’s west coast and includes the mega-city of Mumbai (Bombay), its capital. The state has a population of 114 million, making it more populous than the Philippines and nearly as populous as Mexico. That is, if it were an independent country, it would be no. 12 by population. The state’s annual gross domestic product is $233 billion, putting it in the same neighborhood as Iraq, Chile and the Philippines. Wind power in Brazil doubled in the past year, and solar is up 62%. Brazil is looking to add 6 new gigawatts of electricity generation capacity in 2015. The United Arab Emirates plans to add 100 megawatts of new solar PV capacity soon. By 2017 the largest solar plant in the Middle East will open, with a capacity of 200 megawatts. By 2021, the UAE plans to get 24% of its electricity from renewables. The UAE is a country of about 9 million, though only about 2 million of those are citizens. It has a GDP of about $400 billion annually, mainly income earned from petroleum exports. But Dubai has emerged as a finance hub and the country is diversifying away from oil. Unlike American CEO’s, the Gulf sheikhs are usually not in any doubt about climate change or the likelihood that the globe will have to give up burning hydrocarbons. The UAE is attempting to position itself as a major player in green energy markets via its Masdar corporation. Why is all this happening? Because solar power and wind power are competitive with hydrocarbons even if we don’t figure in externalities. Their real price is rapidly falling. Externalities are things like pollution, which economists often do not figure into their formulas for profitability. If we considered externalities, then coal, gas and oil are worthless because they are so destructive. Burning them is like setting off multiple atomic bombs in the atmosphere. But even if you left a little thing like that out of your equations, solar and wind can now compete with other forms of energy in the global marketplace. For instance, Dubai let a bid for a new solar PV plant that will generate electricity for only 6 cents a kilowatt hour. It would have cost the UAE more than that to build a natural gas plant. We are only at the beginning of a huge electricity price drop.\n",

            "Topic: How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?\n",
            "Paragraph: An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds Editor’s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century. The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care. But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology. But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday. Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain. What is ALS—and is there more than one form of it? ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.—is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both. It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons. There is also primary lateral sclerosis—PLS—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder. The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles. Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia. One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true. What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease? One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time. Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier. Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type? Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say. He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur. How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS? I would say probably less than a few percent. How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS? It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease. Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference? I don't believe that adds to longevity. ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments? Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet. What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease? It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens.\n",

            "Topic: Where does America’s e-waste end up? GPS tracker tells all\n",
            "Paragraph: High above the Pacific Ocean in a plane headed for Hong Kong, most of the passengers are fast asleep. But not Jim Puckett. His eyes are fixed on the glowing screen of his laptop. Little orange markers dot a satellite image. He squints at the pixelated terrain trying to make out telltale signs. He’s searching for America’s electronic waste. \"People have the right to know where their stuff goes,\" he says. Dead electronics make up the world’s fastest-growing source of waste. The United States produces more e-waste than any country in the world. Electronics contain toxic materials like lead and mercury, which can harm the environment and people. Americans send about 50,000 dump trucks worth of electronics to recyclers each year. But a two-year investigation by the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based e-waste watchdog group, concluded that sometimes businesses are exporting electronics rather than recycling them. Puckett’s organization partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to put 200 geolocating tracking devices inside old computers, TVs and printers. They dropped them off nationwide at donation centers, recyclers and electronic take-back programs — enterprises that advertise themselves as \"green,\" \"sustainable,\" \"earth friendly\" and \"environmentally responsible.\" \"The trackers are like miniature cell phones,\" he said. \"The little devices went out and spoke to us, called home regularly, saying ‘this is where I am.’\" About a third of the tracked electronics went overseas — some as far as 12,000 miles. That includes six of the 14 tracker-equipped electronics that Puckett’s group dropped off to be recycled in Washington and Oregon. The tracked electronics ended up in Mexico, Taiwan, China, Pakistan, Thailand, Dominican Republic, Canada and Kenya. Most often, they traveled across the Pacific to rural Hong Kong. It’s the same route Puckett is taking now. Undercover In The New Territories The next morning Puckett follows the little orange markers to a region of Hong Kong called the New Territories, a long-time agricultural area along the border with mainland China that’s shifted toward industry in recent decades. He teams up with a Chinese journalist and translator, Dongxia Su, and a local driver, who will help navigate the region. They follow a set of GPS coordinates for one of the tracked electronics. Paved streets become rutted dirt roads. They pass a steady stream of trucks carrying shipping containers from the port. As they approach their first destination — \"One-hundred feet away. Eighty feet. Seventy-seven feet,\" Puckett says — they hear sounds of power drills and shattering glass. It’s coming from the other side of a high metal wall made from old shipping containers. \"It should be in this yard here,\" Puckett says, pointing toward the fence. \"Forty feet away.\" Su pounds on the front gate, and the drilling stops. A worker shouts from beyond the fence and Su tells him the group is shopping for used electronics. She says they want to fill a shipping container with printers to refurbish and sell in Pakistan. The door opens. Inside, workers are dismantling LCD TVs. The ground at their feet is littered with broken white tubes. These fluorescent lamps were made to light up flat-screens. When they break they release invisible mercury vapor. Even a minuscule amount of mercury can be a neurotoxin. The workers aren’t wearing protective face masks. One worker says he isn’t aware of the risks. \"He had no idea,\" Su says, after speaking with him in Mandarin. The New Territories used to serve only as a pass-through for smuggled e-waste, Puckett said, where workers would unload shipping containers and put electronics on smaller trucks bound for mainland China. But a crackdown by the Chinese government on whole electronic imports, part of a border control operation called \"Green Fence,\" has prevented many electronics from moving across the border. \"Now they’re doing the processing here,\" he said. Puckett has been investigating the afterlife of consumer electronics for nearly two decades. Over the years, his team staked out U.S. recycling operations and followed shipping containers overseas to uncover the environmental and human health consequences of the global e-waste trade. Many U.S. consumers got their first glimpse of what happens to their discarded electronics in Puckett’s 2001 film \"Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia.\" It captured the crude recycling methods taking place in Guiyu, a cluster of villages in southeastern China that has since become known as the world’s biggest graveyard for America’s electronic junk. In the video, villagers desoldered circuit boards over coal-fired grills, burned plastic casings off wires to extract copper, and mined gold by soaking computer chips in black pools of hydrochloric acid. Researchers later found the region had some of the highest levels of cancer-causing dioxins in the world due to its e-waste industry.1 Puckett’s documentary came out more than a decade after nearly every developed nation on the globe had ratified the Basel Convention, an international treaty to stop developed countries from dumping hazardous waste on poorer nations. Now, more than a quarter-century after that treaty was written, and more than 15 years since he exposed Guiyu, Puckett said little has changed. The United States is the only industrialized country in the world that hasn’t ratified the treaty. Its hazardous waste is still getting exported to countries with fewer health and environmental safety laws, according to Puckett’s latest investigation. \"It’s still a dirty little secret,\" Puckett said. \"It’s still a story that needs to be told.\" Over the years Puckett’s attempts to quantify and draw attention to exported electronic waste has drawn criticism from U.S. recyclers who say the problem has been exaggerated. \"The vast majority of electronics collected for recycling in the U.S. are recycled in the U.S.,\" said Eric Harris of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a Washington, D.C.-based recycling trade association. \"We would really challenge the notion that there’s a mass exodus of equipment that’s leaving in an unprocessed manner.\" Estimates of U.S. e-waste exports vary widely. The United Nations says that between 10 and 40 percent of U.S. e-waste gets exported for dismantling. While the International Trade Commission — through a survey of recyclers — said in 2013 that a mere 0.13 percent of all used electronics collected in the U.S. went abroad for dismantling. Puckett turned to GPS tracking technology as a new tool to determine just how big the e-waste export problem really might be. He partnered with Carlo Ratti of the Senseable City Lab at MIT to deploy the strategy. \"Tracking is really the first step in order to design a better system,\" Ratti said. \"One of the surprising things we discovered is how far waste travels. You see this kind of global e-waste flow that actually almost covered the whole planet.\" Unlicensed And Unregulated Puckett’s GPS receiver leads the way to another set of high fences. A sign out front proclaims that it’s farmland. But a look over the fence reveals a lot the size of a football field piled 15 feet high with printers. Workers are breaking them. Their clothes are dusted black with toner ink, a probable carcinogen known to cause respiratory problems. Su talks to the workers and finds out many are migrants from mainland China, who are residing in Hong Kong without the official documents required for them to legally be there, she says. \"There is no protection of this labor force,\" Puckett says. \"There are no occupational laws that are going to protect them.\" That doesn’t surprise Jackson Lau, director of the Hong Kong Recycle Materials and Reproduction Business General Association. \"The majority of these workshops tend to operate in a shady manner,\" unlicensed and poorly regulated, said Lau, a licensed, second-generation paper and plastics recycler in the region. Electronics are often labeled as raw plastics to get through customs, Lau said, but they’re actually whole devices that the junkyard workers dismantle. They sell the most valuable components to buyers in mainland China, while workers indiscriminately dump the worthless leftovers. He said a lack of oversight by Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department is not only harming workers in the facilities but also the neighboring communities and environment. Several fires have broken out at junkyards in the past year, including two incidents in March that emitted plumes of toxic black smoke, according to local news reports. Burning e-waste is known to generate dioxins, a family of cancer-causing chemicals that endure for long periods of time in the environment and human body. More than a month after the fires, rusty metals and ashen plastics still emit chemical odors and blanket the soil along a nearby river. Cheung Kwai Choi, a farmer who has lived in the region for a half-century, said the e-waste junkyards and fires have multiplied in recent years. \"When I was young, I used to drink water directly from the river,\" he said through an interpreter. \"Now I do not even dare drink water from the well.\" He recently began advocating for stronger regulations on junkyards. \"I really hope that our land has not been contaminated,\" Cheung said. \"And that our village will not be plagued by cancer, like the ones discovered in mainland China.\" Hong Kong bans the import of hazardous e-waste like cathode ray tubes and flat-screens from the United States and other developed nations, according to Environmental Protection Department spokesperson Heidi Liu.2 \"On the whole, Hong Kong has been effective in combating hazardous waste shipments,\" Liu said, citing 21 instances in the past three years in which cargo loads of e-waste were sent back to the U.S. Even The Most Reputable Recyclers Export At two junkyards, Puckett finds labels from a library, a hospital and other organizations in Washington and Oregon. \"It’s getting close to home,\" he says. Then he finds a clue as to how these materials ended up here. Many boxes bear the logo for Total Reclaim, one of the largest electronics recyclers in the Pacific Northwest with contracts to handle e-waste from the City of Seattle,King County, the University of Washington and the State of Washington.3 It is also one of the larger recyclers operating in Oregon. Total Reclaim scored these big regional recycling contracts in part because it was certified by e-Stewards, a responsible-recycling certification program created by Puckett’s Basel Action Network. Puckett started e-Stewards in 2010 to create a set of ethical and environmentally-friendly industry standards and prevent the export of toxic materials in lieu of federal laws. Total Reclaim was a founding member. Electronics recyclers with e-Stewards certification can export the raw plastics and metals that come from dismantling electronics. But they adopt a strict no-export policy with regard to whole electronics with hazardous materials still inside. Recyclers can also exported used electronics as long as they’ve been tested and proven to be still functioning. Last May Puckett’s team dropped two non-working LCD TVs, with tracking devices placed inside, at separate recyclers in Oregon. From there, the tracked electronics traveled to Total Reclaim’s warehouse in south Seattle. Then they went to the Port of Seattle, across the Pacific Ocean to the Port of Hong Kong and ultimately to two junkyards in the New Territories. Workers at those junkyards said they import and dismantle LCDs from the United States. Total Reclaim wasn’t the only leading domestic e-waste recycler that collected non-working electronics with tracking devices inside that went overseas, the Basel Action Network concluded through its investigation. In 2004 Dell created a take-back program called Dell Reconnect. That made it the first major computer manufacturer to ban the export of non-working electronics to developing countries. The computer maker partners with the nonprofit thrift store chain Goodwill Industries, which collects any brand of old computer for free to be refurbished or recycled. The investigation focused on Dell’s program after whistleblowers drew Puckett’s attention. BAN dropped off 28 tracked electronics at participating Goodwill locations and determined that six of the tracking devices went abroad — to Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China and Thailand. Puckett followed those tracking devices overseas to junkyards in Hong Kong and Taiwan that import and dismantle whole electronics.4 Beth Johnson, head of Dell’s producer responsibility programs, said the company conducts regular audits of Goodwill and vets downstream recycling partners. \"If there’s something that did not follow the system we would certainly want to know about it and certainly take corrective action,\" Johnson said. Goodwill’s public relations official declined requests for an interview and instead issued a statement Friday after Puckett briefed officials about the findings of his group’s investigation. \"Goodwill Industries International is committed to understanding new insights into the e-cycling space from the final report,\" the statement said, and \"encourages Goodwill organizations participating in the Dell Reconnect program to evaluate the continuation of their contracts with Dell\" and to take steps to ensure that electronics are responsibly recycled. In all, BAN’s investigation found that 65 tracked devices went through U.S. recyclers and ended up overseas. The results showed that some of those exported electronics had been dropped off at green-certified recyclers. BAN plans to conduct further investigations before reporting more about these recyclers. \"I’m getting disillusioned by certification programs,\" Puckett said. \"It is clear that these certifications need to be better enforced and we intend to do just that.\" On Thursday, the Basel Action Network announced that Total Reclaim was suspended from the e-Stewards program for two years. In a phone interview, co-owner Craig Lorch acknowledged that some of Total Reclaim’s LCD flatscreen monitors have been shipped to Hong Kong, despite the company’s no-export policy. \"Our stuff was over there,\" Lorch said. \"We take responsibility for that and the mistakes we’ve made.\" Both the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Washington Department of Ecology have launched investigations into whether Total Reclaim violated their state hazardous waste laws. Oregon regulators have also asked the state Department of Justice to open an investigation into whether Total Reclaim violated consumer protection laws. Lorch said economic realities forced the company to renege on pledges to recycle all the waste that they collect. In recent years, LCD monitors have become a larger portion of the waste stream, but the flat-screens are expensive and time-consuming to dismantle. \"We’re struggling for survival,\" he said. Bear Market For Commodities Prices for many commodities found in e-waste, a major source of revenue for electronics recyclers, have plunged in the past year. In January, copper fetched half its 2011 price, hitting the lowest level in seven years. Plastics prices have bottomed out, recyclers say. At the height of the market, Total Reclaim sold steel for $300 a ton. The price recently fell to $60 a ton, Lorch said. Harris, from the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said those falling commodity prices have put many companies in trouble. \"The last several years have been some of the most difficult times that the recycling industry has seen in decades,\" he said. In a bear market for commodities, exporting waste is more profitable than processing it domestically. Recyclers simply fill a shipping container with whole electronics and an e-waste broker arranges for pick up. Printers, which hold little value, and LCD TVs, which are expensive to recycle because of the tedious dismantling work associated with mercury, make good candidates for export. \"This e-waste recycling business is like the wild, wild west,\" said Wendy Neu, a 30-year veteran of the recycling and scrap metal industry. \"People are getting paid to recycle these materials through government programs and then are exporting to China and Africa.\" Neu is the CEO of Hugo Neu, a New York-based e-waste recycler and e-Steward, that just months ago decided to shift its business model away from recycling. Now it only refurbishes electronics for resale. Neu, a board member of BAN, said they couldn’t compete with recyclers that spent pennies on the pound to export, while Neu’s company hired workers and paid for the latest advanced recycling technology. \"The industry is not going to survive as is under the current system,\" Neu said. Patchwork Of Laws The United States has no federal laws banning the export of e-waste.5 Bills have repeatedly failed to gain traction in Congress going back to the 1990s. The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries has opposed versions of those bills, arguing that these types of laws on exports would harm the recycling sector and are unnecessary because the industry is well-regulated by existing federal and state laws.6 The country is home to a patchwork of state laws. In half of states, landfilling electronics is legal. Some states, including Washington and Oregon, have paired landfill bans with laws that incentivize local recycling. The two Northwest states use \"producer responsibility\" laws similar to those in the European Union. Electronics manufacturers pay a fee to the state on electronics sold locally. The money helps subsidize approved recyclers like Total Reclaim, which recoup money through the program based on the amount of electronics the company collects. The laws aim to prevent dumping locally and abroad, assuring the public that obsolete electronics won’t get sent to third-world countries. \"States are supposed to do audits that should preclude that behavior,\" Harris said. But according to BAN’s tracking data, even audited companies were found to be exporting, including some in Oregon, Washington, California, Michigan and New Jersey. In addition, states don’t have jurisdiction to ban exports. \"There’s definitely not enough perp walks being done,\" said John Shegerian, chief executive of Electronics Recycling International, the largest e-waste recycling firm in the country. \"We need to step up enforcement to match the certification programs we have.\" Until that happens, Puckett said he assumes the problem will get worse. About 20,000 new electronic devices will be released to U.S. consumers this year. More than 1.4 billion smartphones will be sold globally, five times the amount sold five years ago. Like LCDs, CRT monitors and printers, some of those electronics may present new economic challenges for recyclers. \"Until we solve this, we’ve got to keep going,\" Puckett said. It’s been almost 20 years since Puckett started this fight. He said he hopes it doesn’t take another 20 to end it. 1. A study by the Hong Kong Baptist University found surface soils in Guiyu had high levels of cancer-causing dioxins.

            "Topic: Sextacles: How Snapchat's new Spectacles are being used in the sack\n",
            "Paragraph: When Snap CEO Evan Spiegel described Spectacles—his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses—in a September Wall Street Journal story, he called them a \"toy.\" There's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one Spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: Spectacles as a sex toy. Of course, behind closed doors, it's already happened. \"It was the first thing I thought as we were waiting in line,\" said media entrepreneur Rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in Venice Beach with the guy she's seeing. (Names of users have been changed by Mashable at their request for privacy.) SEE ALSO: People are already hacking their Snapchat Spectacles Rachel's not alone. Financial analyst Richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. He saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of Spectacles from the shop in New York. \"It seemed easy, and better than a phone,\" he told Mashable. \"I liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\" Snap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages—the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have—made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. And with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun. To wit, take our friend Richard's feedback: \"The circular video part\"—which is how Spectacles films footage, where users watching Spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone—\"was really cool.\" \"By turning my phone,\" he continued, \"I get a whole new vantage point.\" Of his own amateur sex footage, he means. And maybe, one day, someone else's. The idea was an obvious one for some Snapchat users, Rachel and Richard included. Right after the initial Spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. The idea was practically floated by Snap themselves in the marketing for Spectacles—photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless. you have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com/klm9kZM7B2 — Damon Beres ✨ (@dlberes) September 24, 2016 How will sex tapes change after Spectacles? — Alex Micu (@axelk) September 27, 2016 Snapchat Spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because A) the camera is at your eye level B) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com/QosgVH3j9e — Gary He (@garyhe) September 24, 2016 But you know what they say—there's truth in every joke. And this one's time is coming. Given the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy. Yet—most of them have at least had the idea. \"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained. \"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\" Of course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed. Of the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex. \"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said. \"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\" The experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times. \"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said. It wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious. \"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn’t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said. Jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows—literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself. \"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"—the color of her Spectacles—\"was a bad choice,\" she said. \"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\" A series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend. While Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story. They don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories. Still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the Stories off of the app, deletes them from Snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder. \"I'm a little skeptical about how much Snapchat can see,\" she said. Richard and Jennifer saved their videos in \"My Eyes Only,\" a section of the app protected by a pin code, which Snapchat released back in July. As for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using Spectacles, but one could still—and isn't unlikely to—show up in the near future. Jesse Adams, co-founder and CEO of adult content app platform MiKandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of Spectacles. \"We haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there’s a new gadget, we’re very excited in terms of how to explore it,\" he said. His company embraced the first wearable camera, Google Glass, and used it to create an app called \"Tits and Glass\" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013. \"The question is what appeal will these Spectacles have, if any, to this industry. Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\" Snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex. The gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however. All sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for Snap and Snapchat. That's not too surprising given that Spectacles only upload videos directly to Snapchat. A pornography section of its community guidelines states, \"Snapchat prohibits accounts that use public Stories to distribute sexually explicit content.\" There's no control or limitation to what users do with Snapchat privately, of course. Cindy Gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called MakeLoveNotPorn, said she wished Snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case. She credited Snapchat's \"explosive growth\"—which now boasts 150 million daily active users—to sexting, and though Mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app. \"Spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context,\" Gallop said. \"I would love to see Snap be open and active about it. In fact, Spectacles owners have some recommendations. \"The glasses kept slipping off. I remember thinking at the time: I wish there was a strap,\" Richard said. Just as Snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, there's bound to be  accessories for Spectacles. \n",

            "Topic: This \"Star Wars\" Theory About Rey Is Insane\n",
            "Paragraph: More like Grandpa-lpatine. The conclusion of Star Wars: The Force Awakens left us all with one question: Who are Rey's parents? While many people believed the final shot was a clue to Rey being a Skywalker, there were just as many theories that she was a Kenobi, or someone totally unrelated to previous characters from the series. But a new theory has awakened: that Rey is in fact Emperor Palpatine's granddaughter. YouTuber Vincent Vendetta uploaded a video compiling the evidence to support this theory, and honestly it's pretty compelling. There's the matter of their fighting styles. Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move. This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust. Rey's first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine's fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental. This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey's parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now. That's because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark. In the film's script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\". During Rey's vision, Palpatine can be heard several times. Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine's scream, and further along, there's audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine's inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke's lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol' Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey? The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens. In the portrait form, Rey's strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense. But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they're one. Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey's British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep. Palpatine. There's even more compelling evidence when you take into account clues from the film's script, the accompanying novel, and other hints from the film.\n",

            "Paragraph: Many would be forgiven for thinking that the model in the 2017 Florale by Triumph campaign was a woman in her twenties. But the stunning fresh-faced model is in fact 55-year-old Japanese singer, Seiko Matsuda. The striking pop singer-songwriter, dubbed 'The Eternal Idol' is proof that beauty truly knows no bounds and has wowed thousands as the star of the Summer campaign. Scroll down for video   The video sees Seiko, who first made a name for herself in the music industry at 18, wearing a pale pink two piece and a gorgeous floral bra from the new range. She then flashes a grin at the camera before running across a bed of flowers and posing candidly in a chair.  The commercials were filmed with a special, high speed camera to capture her every moment and have earned her a new cult following among younger circles. According to the company, the Florale line is specifically designed for mature wearers and is all about 'complementing the unique beauty and confidence of women with an abundance of rich life experiences'. Seiko, a woman who has embraced her age and exudes confidence in her own body and skin, was a perfect fit.  The glamorous star also starred in the 2016 Florale by Triumph intimate apparel ads at the age of 54. According to various Japanese reports, many of the Japanese cosmetics and clothing companies have been targeting 'wealthy, middle-aged women in their 50s and 40s' as they 'remain active consumers, regardless of economic consumers'.  Seiko, one of the most recognisable faces in the country, was one of the most famed singers in the 80s and has held a number of records for the amount of singles on Japan's Oricon charts. She has also appeared in a number of TV shows and movies and has starred in commercials for the likes of Sony, Minolta and Diosa Hair Colour.  \n",

            "Paragraph: Global warming. Terrorism. Governments. Mental illness. Cancer. Losing our job. Our parents dying. If you're anything like me, you'll swing from total paralysis about the sheer number of potential or imagined dangers mounting against you, and violently rejecting panic as a concept, charging almost self-destructively towards a future. There's plenty to be scared of as a young person – but how do you quantify those fears? Which specific ones keep you up at night? In the VICELAND UK Census, we asked readers \"What are you most scared of?\". The answer that came out on top was: never finding love. You're more scared of never meeting the love of your life than being homeless, losing your job or finding yourself in the middle of a terrorist attack. It's even stronger for people who are single, a significant 42 percent say it is their biggest fear. Are we more romantic than we thought – or just lonelier than we'd like to admit? This fear of not finding love is, on some level, driven by isolation. It speaks volumes about self worth. Are we lonely? Every study from the past few years would suggest that we are. Loneliness was, until recently, thought to be a shadow following old people, but despite social media, we're the ones suffering from chronic disconnection. Britain was voted the loneliness capital of Europe, and it's not our ageing population we have to thank. In 2010, the Mental Health Foundation found loneliness is a greater concern among young people. The 18-to-34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s. According to a 2014 national survey, 48 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds said they often felt lonely compared to the overall average of 34 percent. Young Londoners were roughly twice as likely to be lonely than the national average. Perhaps this plays into our ultimate fear because we're a generation that has grown up living between two parents' houses. Our template for life-long love is fractured, so we understand the transitory nature of relationships more than ever. It's not surprising we're cautious about commitment, or at least enter into it with a somewhat defeatist attitude and limited expectations. Although we know that separation often means longer term happiness when relationships break down, there's no clear end goal for our love lives. Maybe that's exactly why we crave it so much. The nature of dating is changing. The cycle of relationships gets tired. In your 20s, every time a relationship dies, it takes a little more energy to ready yourself for the next one. Perhaps we've shot ourselves in the foot by having so many options, or the illusion of options, this feeling that there could be someone better or more a fulfilling relationship out there. Is the answer holding out for an idealised love while your fears of being single for too long are legitimised by the people around you settling down? In your 20s, when you can't get security from your job or housing situation, a real, loving relationship becomes a more idealised prospect. We don't like settling when it comes to anything, but our overall instability makes us crave it from somewhere. Another reason for our fear could be that we're finding it more difficult to maintain friendships. Being in love and in a relationship fills an undeniable void, even if you never thought you had it. Most people only feel fully \"known\" by the world when they're with another person; someone who sees the best and worst of you, witnesses you at every moment of any given day, takes you to hospital, knows with intimacy has to be the first person at your birthday or your gig or football match cheering you on. At my friend Jack Urwin's launch of his book, Man Up, he and a bloke from male suicide prevention charity CALM discussed that often the only person men will turn to in times of distress will be their partner. The reality is that many men lose mates throughout their 20s. Two and half million men over the age of 18 in Britain don't have a close friend they'd discuss a serious life problem with. Perhaps a big part of reshaping modern masculinity is the realisation that men crave intimacy just as much as women are stereotypically thought to. Despite all this, why should never finding love be our greatest worry? It's not something any of us would easily admit (I certainly wouldn't). Professor Ben Fincham, who has just finished writing a book on fun, told me the other day that after all his research, he's concluded that you have to be with another person or people to have fun. It just doesn't work if you're alone. To have fun – a temporal burst of life, joy, however you define it – allows you to feel pleasure, contentment, happiness, excited for a longer, less defined period of time after the fact. We're taught that interdependence is weak and individualism is to be celebrated – we don't want to be our mum or dad in our late 40s, divorced and lost, surrounded by the pieces of a half-baked identity. Yet when it comes down to hopes and fears, we're no different to our parents and their parents and anyone who came before us. We want to be our grandparents, linking arms for a walk to the shop and pissing each other off as way of conversation. We want something that will last. @hannahrosewens We launched a TV channel!

            "Topic: Why 2020 Olympic Bidders Should Be Hoping For Second Place\n",
            "Paragraph: This weekend seems certain to bring raucous celebration to the streets of Madrid, Tokyo or Istanbul, as the International Olympic Committee awards the 2020 summer games to one of those three cities, all currently vying to play host. For the two metropolises whose bids fall short, stunned disappointment will surely descend, as city leaders bemoan a lost economic opportunity. Yet this inevitable reaction fails to account for a little-understood reality of the Olympics as catalyst for urban development: In seeking to host the games, coming in second tends to work out better, say economists who have studied this phenomenon. The runner-up tends to invest in the same sort of infrastructure aimed at impressing the Olympic committee, such as roadway improvements and modern signage, which assist in spurring trade and commerce. But the No. 2 choice then gets spared the expense and hassle of actually hosting the games. The result is a surge of productive investment in the early stages, and an avoidance of the sort of white elephant construction projects that get built right before the games commence. \"There is no way that it’s in your national interest to host the games, but it may be in your interest to bid for the games,\" said Andrew Rose, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-wrote a 2009 paper on the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics. According to Rose’s research, countries that hosted the Olympics between 1950 and 2006 saw a 30 percent jump in international trade thanks to measures they took while they were trying to impress the IOC -- including political decisions like opening up trade or allowing freer exchange in the national currency. It might sound like a good argument for hosting, Rose said, were it not for the fact that bidding countries not selected saw an economic impact \"every bit as big as the effect of actually hosting the games.\" The positive outcome for the runner-up nations reflects the nature of the Olympic host bidding process, Rose said. In the multi-year campaign for Olympic glory, countries generally take productive steps to open and modernize their economies. \"You want to send a signal to the world and to your own populace that you’re opening up, that you’re an important part of the world, and hosting a mega-event is one way to do that,\" Rose said. \"Of course, it’s better if you don’t have to pay for it.\" Stephen Billings, a professor of urban economics at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, N.C., has similarly studied the economic gains seen from hosting the Olympics. His conclusion: Cities that get as far as the finalist stage are already winners. \"There’s no real difference between runner-up cities and the ones that are eventually selected,\" Billings said. He explained that, in nearly all cases, cities bidding to host the games spend the years before the final IOC decision building up their infrastructure, a dynamic that yields positive economic fruits. In fact, many economists have said that having the games rarely benefits the host nation at all. Once they actually win the bid, cities spend massive sums on stadiums and Olympic villages that often prove less useful in the future. The expensive projects tend to experience massive cost overruns as construction deadlines approach. And security costs running into the billions of dollars have made the possibility of running a profitable Olympics even less likely in a post-9/11 world. Of the three cities currently vying for the Olympics, Madrid has presented a self-described \"low-budget\" option, costing an estimated $5 billion. The city says it will rely heavily on existing infrastructure and will only need to build four stadiums for the event. Some 19 new Olympic Village apartment blocks will be reused as housing projects once the games have left town. Those projections haven’t stopped critics on the country’s political left from labeling the event, being sought at a time when Spain is facing Depression-level unemployment and a foreclosure crisis, as \"The Hunger Games.\" Istanbul has pulled out all stops, proposing a $19 billion budget for the Olympics. Tokyo’s proposal involves $8 billion in projected expenses. An April report by the IOC team scored various aspects of each city’s bid, giving an edge to Madrid and Tokyo, with preliminary scores of 8.08 and 8.02, respectively. Istanbul received a score of 6.98. \"Nearly all academic economists who aren’t connected to the IOC agree that the Olympics are extremely expensive events and that cities have almost no chance to make up those costs,\" said Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at Holy Cross University in Worcester, Mass., who has also studied the issue. There have been exceptions, Matheson noted, including profitable games in Los Angeles in 1984 and an Olympics in Barcelona in 1992, which helped transform the Spanish metropolis from an industrial second city into one of Europe’s most important tourist destinations. But those cases are highly unusual: Los Angeles presented a low-ball bid that was accepted by the Olympic Committee for lack of better options. Barcelona \"had the perfect combination for the event,\" Matheson said -- \"a hidden gem city that had a lot to offer tourists, but wasn’t well-known to the world.\" The people pushing for their cities to be Olympic hosts are not ignorant of these facts, Matheson said, but they may convince themselves their city is the next Barcelona. \"It’s almost like what they say about a second marriage: It’s the triumph of hope over experience,\" Matheson said. Andrew Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., takes a dimmer view. His extensive research on the topic has shown him that cities most likely to win Olympic host bids are the ones with opaque political institutions captured by special interests, he said. \"The city that wins is likely the one that has outbid everyone because they have a lot of construction companies and construction unions, and maybe lawyers, and maybe investment bankers who are looking to float the loans, all pushing hard for this,\" Zimbalist said. \"It’s a self-perpetuating Olympic juggernaut.\"\n",

            "Topic: You Won’t Believe This Stunning ‘Harry Potter’ Revelation About Professor McGonagall\n",
            "Paragraph: From reading J.K. Rowling‘s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga. Obversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort’s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from ‘lasting more than a year’. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn’t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall’s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there? As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort’s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle’s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right. Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor? Take note of Professor McGonagall’s wand. It’s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration. It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore’s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration. After all, the Dark Lord was probably, \"angry, vindictive, and jealous of McGonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as \"what was rightfully his\". He was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. Just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between Harry Potter and himself throughout the entire saga.\n",

            "Topic: Scientists Uncover Mystery Of Singing Fish\n",
            "Paragraph: Singing fish actually exist – and these are not the kind that people see in cartoons or children’s movies, too. The plainfin midshipman fish sound like a bunch of kazoos, and people on boats in the San Francisco Bay area have had to get used to a low humming sound at night that stops when daylight approaches. Porichthys notatus, as its scientific name is, has a specific reason for singing. The male fish use them to try to mate, while the females only grunt in response. The unusual sound has been likened to \"an orchestra full of mournful, rasping oboes,\" according to the San Francisco Gate in 2004. Researchers from Cornell University believe they have finally discovered what causes the strange melody: melatonin. Melatonin, a hormone naturally produced by plants and animals, is released at night, the Washington Post reports. In animals – like humans – that sleep a night, melatonin is believed to control the internal body clock, telling the rest of the body that it’s tie to sleep. Some have even found a treatment for insomnia in taking melatonin supplements before going to bed. But how melatonin functions in vertebrates that come alive at night has been unclear. Nocturnal animals do make melatonin when night comes, meaning it doesn’t put them to sleep. The new study suggests that melatonin may be more of a trigger to signal night-specific behaviors, including prompting midshipman fish to sing. \"Our results, together with those of others that also show melatonin’s actions on vastly different timescales, highlight the ability of hormones in general to regulate the output of neural networks in the brain to control distinct components of behavior,\" Andrew Bass, the lead author, says. He explains that with melatonin in particular, \"one hormone can exert similar or different effects in diurnal vs. nocturnal species depending on the timescale of action, from day-night rhythms to the duration of single calls.\" The researchers tested how melatonin works by keeping the fish in total darkness and in constant light. In the dark, the fish carried out their same routine, but in the light, there was no singing. The researchers then gave the fish in the light an artificial melatonin boost and they suddenly began singing, though at irregular times. The study was published in Current Biology.\n",

            "Paragraph: The country that tops per capita world consumption of Coca-Cola products is pondering a soda tax. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto proposed a tax on sugary beverages to rein in obesity as part of a larger reform effort unveiled Sunday. If the proposal were to become law, Mexicans would pay an extra peso -- about 7.6 cents -- per liter, according to McClatchy newspapers. The tax would net the Mexican government $900 million in revenue, the Wall Street Journal reports. The proposal to tax sugary drinks came as part of a broader reform package originally expected to address only tax policy. Instead, however, Peña Nieto pitched a wide-ranging expansion of the country’s social programs to be financed by cutting tax loopholes that benefit large companies. \"The tax reform is a social policy reform,\" Pena Nieto said in a speech announcing his plan, the Associated Press reports. Mexicans drink more Coca-Cola products per capita than people from any other country in the world, at average of 728 8-ounce drinks per year in 2011, compared to 403 per year for Americans, according to McClatchy. Coca-Cola de Mexico criticized the proposal to tax sugary drinks in a statement reported by Agence France Presse, saying \"a tax on beverages is ineffective to combat a problem as complex as obesity.\" A spokesperson for Coca-Cola's Mexico office told the Wall Street Journal last month that the company's drinks are \"healthy and can be integrated into a correct diet, combined with an active lifestyle.\" The news comes amid increased international attention to the issue of obesity in Mexico -- a problem that many scientists attribute at least in part to the growing prevalence of sodas and cheap snack foods. Obesity in the Latin American country has surpassed that in the United States, according to a report released by the U.N. in June. The report, based on figures from 2008, placed the Mexican adult obesity rate at 32.8 percent, overtaking the U.S. figure of 31.8 percent. Obesity specialist Kelly Brownell at Duke University told Reuters prior to Peña Nieto’s proposal that curbing soda consumption made sense as a policy option, given the scientific evidence. \"The strongest scientific link between any category of food and obesity is with sugared beverages,\" Brownell said, according to Reuters. \"If you’re going to address obesity, you need to begin somewhere, and why not begin where the science is strongest?\" A public interest group launched an anti-soda public health campaign this summer, featuring images of diabetic amputees. Some 15 percent of Mexicans over the age of 20 suffer from adult-onset diabetes, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n",

            "Paragraph: In Brief A bipartisan bill was passed by the U.S. Senate committee that oversees NASA space projects. The bill would allocate $19.5 billion in funds to NASA in 2017, but it has a critical mission for the space agency: send men to Mars. Funds Are On The Way It looks like Republican and Democratic senators alike are keen on safeguarding America’s space programs. With the potential chaos of a new president on the horizon, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation passed a bipartisan bill giving NASA $19.5 billion to continue working on a mission to Mars. It also includes support for the continuation of the program to send astronauts on private rockets to the International Space Station (ISS) from American soil no later than 2018. \"We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration – that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, \"We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration – that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, commented . \"The impact in terms of jobs lost, the impact in terms of money wasted has been significant.\" The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016 includes an overall authorization level of $19.508 billion for fiscal year 2017, but it still needs to be passed by the Senate as a whole, of course. The budget allotted is the same as what was approved by House appropriators and a bit more than the version released by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Obama administration, likewise, proposed $19 billion in funding for NASA. Credits: NASA Making it rain, NASA-style The Senate is not giving NASA money just for the sake of exploration. It is also a challenge, a mandate, actually. The bill requires that NASA make it an official goal to send crewed missions to Mars in the next 25 years. The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap NASA’s controversial plans to send men on asteroids and collect samples by 2021. It does, however, require the space agency to regularly send progress reports to Congress, justifying its $1.4 billion cost. \"Fifty-five years after President Kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon, the Senate is challenging NASA to put humans on Mars. The priorities that we’ve laid out for NASA in this bill mark the beginning of a new era of American spaceflight,\" said an optimistic Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, senior Democrat on the Commerce panel. The bipartisan support behind the new bill shows that space exploration is an issue that all parties can agree is vital to our growth as a nation and a species. Now we just have to wait to see if it passes the Senate.\n",

            "Paragraph: Dave Brat had two paid staffers who ran his campaign on a flip phone. That contrast is a microcosm of the difference in sophistication between Cantor’s campaign, and the insurgent challenge of Dave Brat, a relatively unknown economics professor from Randolph-Macon College. And it illustrates just how shocking it is that Brat was able to topple the majority leader after 13 years representing Virginia’s conservative Seventh District in Washington.  In interviews here with Brat and Cantor allies, and Brat himself, a sketch of the insurgent’s winning strategy emerges — and it runs completely counter to the conventional wisdom of this election cycle.  This year was branded as one where the establishment strikes back. In some places, it has — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) toppled his tea party challenger by running an aggressive campaign.  But people in Cantor and Brat’s camps say that the majority leader struck back too hard.  Cantor’s aides take pride in running a strong race against any candidate — Democrat or Republican. But the $2 million Cantor spent to brand Brat as a liberal professor may have had the reverse effect, people close to him and Brat say. It showed voters there was an alternative to Cantor -and that was exactly what many voters wanted.  \"The negative ads calling me a liberal professor at first they started off with kind of comic strips,\" Brat said in an interview here late Tuesday night. \"And everyone kind of liked them. Me and my boy watched them the first night and kind of died laughing. We thought they were funny.\"  \"They gave me $1 million in name ID and I think that got us going, I think. I’m not a political expert on that, but I think they kind of saw that was happening and they made those a little darker, and they were black and green and looked like a Star Wars thing by the time they got done with it – it made me look like a pretty serious guy.\"  In both Richmond and Washington, the political class is stunned by Cantor’s defeat. But in an April interview with POLITICO, and again Tuesday night, Brat maintained that he thought he had Cantor cornered. He just didn’t have the polling or political operation to prove it.  On Tuesday night, when the 11-point win was in the books, Brat conceded he was shocked. His supporters flooded the atrium of an office building here in the Richmond suburbs. But Brat sat removed from the action in an office with empty soda cans strewn across a table, chatting on his cellphone. A few volunteers, aides and supporters ate freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and crackers. Brat was sifting through 100 voice mails and 300 texts and emails, he said. Brat said he had not spoken to Cantor since the majority leader conceded in a ballroom at a Westin Hotel in Richmond.  National mood, he said, played a role in his victory.  \"I think it was just kind of a perfect combination of when I was walking door-to-door, you just go up to the door and talk to the average person and everybody is in agreement that the country’s on the wrong track, right?\" he said, before appearing on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program.  \"You just walk up to the door and say, ‘How are you doing?’ and everyone knows we’re on the wrong track. The problem with modern politics is everybody is doing sound bite stuff. In my stump speech, I give 20 minutes on why I think we’re off track. And I think people do really want to engage in a serious high-level discussion on how to get the country back on track because people care about their own country.\"  Indeed, Brat did talk about policy in his stump speech. He railed on Cantor for enabling President Barack Obama, said he supported \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants and blamed him for lax insider trading rules for lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill. Brat also got a bit lucky. At the same time he was emerging, Cantor and his political team were angering conservatives by trying to tighten their grip on the Virginia Republican Party. Cantor tried to boost Linwood Cobb, his close ally, for a local Republican Party chairmanship, and failed. It was a loss that most of his aides brushed aside, but caused real ire among tea partiers.  That widespread discontent became evident Tuesday evening. Cantor lost six of the 10 counties in his district, including Henrico County, his longtime political base.  \"I honestly thought there was a win when I ran way back in January or I wouldn’t have done it,\" Brat said. \"I wasn’t doing it to make a statement. I was doing it because I want to serve the people. I thought it, but that’s far different than doing it. So yeah, it’s an absolute shock to actually execute and follow through on it. It was up to the people right? I’m just one person.\"  He added: \"So what I did couldn’t have made this happen. I was completely dependent on the will of the people in the whole process. They went out knocking doors. We didn’t know if it was going to come to fruition or not. We had no evidence. We didn’t have the money to do fine-tuning polling.\"  The challenge for Brat now is to avoid missteps that frequently trip up political neophytes. He and his aides know it. They’re all exhausted, and now have to juggle media requests from all over the country. They have to get a new office, and begin to examine their race against Jack Trammell, the Democrat running for the seat. The district is solidly Republican, though: Mitt Romney won it by 15 points in 2012, and John McCain won it by 12 in 2009.  Meanwhile, Brat said he needs to recharge.  \"I’m going to relax for a little while and enjoy my family,\" Brat said. \"I haven’t gotten to hit a tennis ball with my kid and go swimming and stuff. I need a little break.\"  When Brat began to walk away from the interview, he quickly turned around and stopped. He said he had just spoken to Sean Hannity on the telephone, and said he wished the press would stop labeling his victory as the conservative right toppling the establishment.  \"I do want to add that the press – and I’ve heard there’s already some senior Democratic officials trying to spin this as a matter of right or left – and I just reject those categories. I’m running on free markets, constitutional principles. I don’t think free markets are either right or left. I don’t think the rule of law is either right or left. So through the duration of the last six months the press has been trying to pigeonhole me. Some people call me a liberal professor, other people call me a tea party candidate.\"  When asked if he is a tea partier, Brat said, \"I just say what I say — I’m running on the Republican principles, the creed. I’ve given stump speech after stump speech on those six principles that I believe in and I have huge grassroots and tea party support, and I owe those people the election. I owe Republicans, tea party, grassroots — they all came together and helped me win tonight. Utter thanks, but the press is trying to do this sound bite stuff and put you in a little hole, and peg you in one way or the other.  \"I do just want to emphasize I’m running on ideas and principles. It’s for real. And so the press ignored me last time when I said that. Everyone’s acting like it’s a mystery how I won. I think the American people actually like principles and ideals. That’s what I said for six months and no one paid any attention. And so now that I won, it’s a shocker, I think it’s for real, based on those themes: principles and ideas matter.\" \n",

            "Paragraph: The job market these days can be a tricky place, especially if you’re the one trying to find a job. But by arming yourself with specific traits, you can showcase your talents and impress hiring managers during the interview process. Let’s take a closer look at some of the traits that hiring managers look for. Contrary to popular belief, having a degree does matter. There has been a lot of chatter online stating that you don’t need a college degree in order to be successful. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Studies show that the unemployment rate for individuals who hold a bachelor’s degree is the lowest it has been since 2008. Additionally, by earning a degree, you’re showing hiring managers that you’re a dedicated, hard-working, educated achiever. Being able to effectively communicate is a necessity within any professional environment. When you possess the ability to communicate, you’re able to connect, correspond, inform and interact with your coworkers on a much higher level. Hiring mangers understand this and look for interpersonal skills when they’re interviewing candidates. If you feel that your communication skills could use some improvement, there are ways to quickly enhance them. Just remember to always remain professional when speaking during an interview. Having a thirst for knowledge is something that will benefit you throughout your entire life. In the workplace, a willingness to learn indicates that you’re flexible and teachable. These are traits that are extremely beneficial when it comes to setting yourself apart from the crowd. During an interview, it’s important to convey your ability to grasp new ideas. Showing that you have a willingness to learn proves that you’re trainable. This also shows your potential to be an asset to the company you are interviewing with. Regardless of your profession or industry, the ability to produce will dramatically impact your success in the workplace. Hiring managers realize this and will be looking for traits that point towards an efficient and productive candidate. One way to show that you have the ability to produce is to present successful projects you’ve been a part of in the past. By displaying your experience as a producer, you’re giving proof that you can carry out and achieve success within your professional career. If you look at any successful enterprise, you’ll see a successful team behind it. An effective team will almost always ensure success within any profession. That’s why it’s imperative to work well with others and try to always be a team player. Wherever you end up working, you’ll most likely be a part of some sort of team. Each team will be comprised of different types of individuals with different backgrounds, personalities, and levels of education. It’s imperative to understand that you’re a part of a diverse group of people trying to reach a shared goal. As you navigate through your professional career, try to showcase these traits to better position yourself within the job market.\n",

Abandoned, alone, and freezing in the winter snow, this baby had a low chance of survival if left alone. No one had checked on the box, assuming it was empty. It had been a few hours since the baby was left in the street. That’s when a long-haired tabby cat, named Masha, came across the abandoned baby. The cat knew the baby was in trouble, and decided to stay by the baby’s side to keep him warm. She began the meow to get the attention of people passing by. Being the communal cat, and familiar with local residents, one individual came close to observe Masha’s peculiar behavior. She thought Masha had been hurt, but upon closer inspection, she saw the abandoned baby. \"She is very placid and friendly, so when I heard her meowing, I thought that perhaps she had injured herself,\" stated Irina Lavrova. \"Normally she would have come and said hello to me... You can imagine my shock when I saw her lying in a box next to a baby.\" The baby was then rushed to a nearby hospital to see if he needed immediate medical attention. Turns out, Masha’s protection and warmth helped the baby stay healthy. \"The baby had only been outside for a few hours and thanks to Masha... he was not damaged by the experience,\" said a hospital employee. Locals have hailed Masha as a hero, and people on the block have been giving Masha her favorite treats ever since. Amazing!\n",

            "Topic: One of the fastest growing fields in science still makes a lot of people very uncomfortable\n",
            "Paragraph: Think of someone whose political ideology leads them to ignore and groundlessly reject science. Typically, this often describes those on the right of the political spectrum, where climate change, women’s reproductive health, and even evolution are routinely dismissed. But a massive and fast growing field in science—behavioral genetics—has a huge body of conclusive evidence that, at first reading, seems at odds with left-wing ideology. This week, Robert Plomin, professor of behavioral genetics at King’s College London, published a paper showing that a child’s educational success can be predicted by their genes. Genetic data from 20,000 DNA variants across several genes collectively account for 10% of the differences in children’s educational achievement age 16. At the most extreme ends of this genetic variation is an entire exam grade difference—from A to B grade for those with the highest polygenic score, to B to C grade for those with the lowest. The notion that success at school could be so influenced by genes is uncomfortable for those who uphold the view that anyone can do or achieve anything they put their mind to. But Plomin’s paper is far from the only publication showing such results. Meta-analysis of 61 twin studies shows that genetic variation accounts for 66% of educational achievement at primary school level. One set of identical twins raised apart shared many similarities—including flushing the toilet before using it, wearing rubber bands on their wrists, reading magazines from back to front, and dipping their toast in coffee. And, disquieting though that may be, twin studies have time and again highlighted other aspects of ourselves that seem to be shaped by genes. Nancy Segal, evolutionary psychologist and behavioral geneticist at California State University who has written And, disquieting though that may be, twin studies have time and again highlighted other aspects of ourselves that seem to be shaped by genes. Nancy Segal, evolutionary psychologist and behavioral geneticist at California State University who has written several books on twin studies , says the research suggests that about 50% of individual differences in personality are affected by genetic variation. Specific examples of twins who were separated at birth and raised apart show that even our personal quirks have a genetic basis. The two-decade long Minnesota Twin Study, which began in 1983, revealed many such cases—including that of identical twins Oskar and Jack. While Oskar grew up in Nazi Germany as a Catholic who took part in Nazi youth, and Jack grew up Jewish in the Caribbean and spent part of his childhood on an Israeli kibbutz, they shared many similarities —including flushing the toilet before using it, wearing rubber bands on their wrists, reading magazines from back to front, and dipping their toast in coffee. Segal also mentions the example of twins Jerry and Mark, raised separately, who both grew up to be firemen, and who both enjoy Budweiser and hold their drink of choice with their pinkie finger underneath the can. \"There’s not a gene for doing that sort of thing, but the twin studies force us to consider other explanations,\" says Segal. \"Could it be that they worry about spilling things, that their hands are made in such a way that they’re more comfortable holding the can that way? Even our quirky habits are not just a matter of random chance but have a real scientific basis in our genetics.\" So we can’t be anything we choose? Though these scientific findings could be alarming for anyone, the seemingly deterministic perspective seems to contradict the left-wing emphasis on the role of privilege in any person’s success. There is, after all, no doubt that the environment plays a massive role in our personal achievement. Wealthy children aged 5 with low cognitive abilities are 35% more likely to be high-earners as adults than highly able children from poor families. In the UK, those who went to private school make up just 7% of the population but almost a third of parliament. Money, which often brings access to a stable home, small class sizes, and excellent education, undeniably buys success. Both Segal and Saskia Selzam, lead researcher on Plomin’s paper, say that they’ve experienced the same. \"Everyone has their own sets of beliefs. Some people ignore data even when other people are persuaded by it,\" says Segal. The evidence is building at such a pace that both say the public seem to have become more accepting over the past couple of years. But though the scientific findings in molecular genetics don’t directly contradict this, many who care deeply about the effects of privilege seem to flinch at the research. I’ve spoken to people with no knowledge of the scientific literature but a strong political perspective who insist that such studies about the role of genes simply cannot be true.Both Segal and Saskia Selzam, lead researcher on Plomin’s paper, say that they’ve experienced the same. \"Everyone has their own sets of beliefs. Some people ignore data even when other people are persuaded by it,\" says Segal. The evidence is building at such a pace that both say the public seem to have become more accepting over the past couple of years. \"The left-wing view is that everyone’s born the same and you can make everyone achieve the same way. From genetics research, we’ve shown that’s not true.\" But the belief that anyone can be anything they choose—that you could take a child and train them towards literally any goal with success is, says Segal, \"such an old-fashioned notion, with absolutely no backing whatsoever.\" But the belief that anyone can be anything they choose—that you could take a child and train them towards literally any goal with success is, says Segal, \"such an old-fashioned notion, with absolutely no backing whatsoever.\" After all, she points out, if she wanted to be a world champion sumo wrestler, the chances are \"pretty unlikely\" given her height and weight. \"Genetics sets some realistic limits,\" she says. But Selzam says it’s important not to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the evidence. \"The left-wing view is that everyone’s born the same and you can make everyone achieve the same way. From genetics research, we’ve shown that’s not true,\" she says. But understanding this can be hugely beneficial for those who are struggling to achieve but don’t know why. For example, she says there’s been a strong educational emphasis on grit and perseverance—but genetics research shows that this personality trait only predicts 5% of why individuals differ. So over-emphasizing it will have moderately little effect and, in making children feel they’re not trying hard enough, might well make many miserable. Also, it’s important to note that just because educational achievement is genetically influenced, that doesn’t mean it’s determined by genetics. Selzam gives a comparable example of someone who’s genetically at risk of dyslexia. If that child is treated like everyone else then, chances are, they will go on to develop the disorder. But if you identify that they’re at genetic risk then, through tutoring and one-on-one support, it’s possible to counter that genetic disposition through \"environmental engineering.\" The evidence is building Behavioral genetics is an extremely fast-developing science, the \"fastest developing science in human existence,\" says Selzam. Human DNA was only decoded 16 years ago, and so researchers have been rushing ahead from that starting point, with rapidly developing technological and methodical advances. Meanwhile, projects with huge sample sizes (Selzam’s own paper relied on research from a study of 293,700 people ) allow researchers to find increasingly detailed results. And though the field may be unnerving, the findings have many practical benefits. Segal suggests that understanding our genetics can help someone with depression find the most suitable therapeutic regime, or explain why an overweight person struggles to lose weight. \"You can find explanations for things that help you plan for the future and alter your lifestyle appropriately,\" she says. Selzam says she hopes her work can help create personalized education \"so that we acknowledge and understand individual differences and work towards creating equal opportunities for children based on who they are.\" Decoding our genetics can highlight our individual risks and resilience. And, crucially, this research helps us understand ourselves.\n",

            "Paragraph: Electric-car startup Lucid Motors Inc. has a team recruited from Tesla Inc. and a slick concept that boasts impressive performance. Now it’s going to need some money. The nascent carmaker unveiled its Air prototype in December and had said it would start production of its all-electric luxury sedan in 2018. That timeline has slipped a bit -- Lucid wants to secure Series D financing before breaking ground on a plant in Arizona, then debut the car in 2019, according to chief technology officer Peter Rawlinson. \"We don’t have the money in place. That’s why we need to secure Series D in order to execute this,\" Rawlinson, who led engineering of Tesla’s Model S sedan, said Thursday at the New York International Auto Show. \"It would be irresponsible to start moving earth or start anything until we have a financial runway to execute that professionally and with absolute integrity.\" Once funding is in place, it will take 24 months before Lucid begins production, Rawlinson said. In November, the company said it would break ground and begin hiring in the first half of 2017, with production beginning in 2018. The extended timeline means Lucid will fall another year behind Tesla and other competitors in the race to bring the next generation of low-emissions vehicles to market. Still, Rawlinson said he’s confident in the car, partially because he says he’s hired most of his old team away from Tesla. \"I have secured many of my key players,\" he said. \"All my vehicle directors that report to me were with me at Tesla on Model S. So the team that’s doing this knows how to do it.\" The Lucid Air will start at $60,000, or $52,500 after federal tax credits. With the equivalent of 400 horsepower, the car will drive 240 miles on a charge, according to the company. A higher-end, 1,000 horsepower version that can drive 400 miles on a charge will be much more expensive, Rawlinson said, selling for \"well north of $100,000.\" That’s how Lucid plans to make money where many electric-car programs have produced red ink. The base model will be profitable because battery costs are low, while the faster versions will compete with the top luxury cars and command loftier prices, he said. Lucid has signed battery-supply agreements with both LG Chem Ltd. and Samsung SDI Co. Lucid has said it plans to build 10,000 vehicles in its first 12 months of production and ramp up to 130,000 annually by 2022. The Air model will come equipped with the hardware required for fully autonomous driving, though the software won’t be ready until 2021 or 2022, Rawlinson said. \"There are a lot of bulls; I’m a bit bearish about the software being available,\" he said. \"But having that sensor suite means we can collect the data, the big data, and that in itself will help accelerate the process toward full autonomy.\" The Air just completed its first high-speed stability test at 217 miles per hour. Its high performance will compete with German luxury manufacturers rather than just with other electric carmakers, Rawlinson said. \"To be credible there, we have to have a car which can run at Autobahn speeds and compete with that set and show its credibility,\" he said. \"It’s a bit like the diver’s watch. It has to go to 1,000 meters. Maybe the human body can’t take 1,000 meters, but to be credible that watch has to deliver what it says it can.\"\n",

            "Topic: Can A Lack Of Love Be Deadly?\n",
            "Paragraph: I taught myself about orphanages 12 years ago, not actually because of my work as a human biologist but because of my daughter. She was born in 2004 and her first 14 months of life were spent in an orphanage in China. I am well acquainted with the vast body of research that shows the physical and psychological harms of deprived environments. Orphanages can arguably be placed under this category along with other places such as refugee camps and some hospitals where children lack close contact and attention. Deprivation comes in many shapes and forms: lack of food, diseases, maltreatment, and child abuse are some of the harms that come to mind. However, I would argue that deprivation of love can be just as deadly. When I started researching orphanages and child health I read the classic works of paediatrician Harry Bakwin, psychologist John Bowlby and psychiatrist Harry Edelston. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the US and the UK, the death rates among infants placed in orphanages, nurseries, and foundling hospitals were, in some cases, close to 100%. London’s Foundling Museum documents in depth these harsh realities. In the 1940s, the work of psychoanalyst Rene Spitz further documented high infant death rates (one out of three) and, among the babies who didn’t die, high percentages of cognitive, behavioural and psychological disfunction. Most of these deaths were not due to starvation or disease, but to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation – in other words, a lack of love. These babies were fed and medically treated, but they were absolutely deprived of important stimulation, especially touch and affection. The importance of touch Human touch is fundamental for human development and survival. Research conducted by Ruth Feldman and Tiffany Field has shown the positive effects that come from skin-to-skin touch in premature babies and that these effects are still at work after ten years. Significant gains in neurological development, weight gain, and mental development of premature babies have been shown to be triggered by skin-to-skin stimulation. Infants in orphanages can be deprived of touch, individual attention, and love. This happens not because all orphanages are terrible places (although some of them are), but because there are usually too many babies for the staff to manage. In the case of the hospitals, in Europe and the US in the first half of the 20th century, nurses were required to cover their faces with surgical masks and not interact with babies. Parents and other family members were prevented from visiting freely as it was believed this would prevent infections from spreading and help keep babies healthy. However, instead of getting better the babies got worse. Bakwin understood that this was harmful to the children’s well-being. He stated that \"failure of infants to thrive in institutions is due to emotional deprivation\". The term \"failure to thrive\" is currently used as an umbrella term of conditions, ranging from growth delay, emotional misery and death. It is a generalised health problem seen in high-income and low-income countries although it is more prevalent when poverty and a lack of human resources prevents the babies from receiving emotional and sensorial stimulation (or love) on a daily basis. My daughter’s story The reports from our adoption agency guaranteed that the children were well taken care of, fed appropriately, and had toys to play with. But how much sensory stimulation were they given? We knew that the babies were trained, from very early, to hold their feeding bottle on their own. It was not possible to have a carer per child during feeding times. We flew to China and adoption day finally arrived. Our daughter seemed to be in good health. She adapted herself to us quickly, clearly enjoying the attention we provided, and ate everything we offered. However, on the day we held her for the first time, 90% of the baby girls her age were taller than her. The effects of short height at this age can linger for life and are usually associated with poor health in later life, such as a greater risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Once we got her back home, we were certain that love and bonding would be what she needed most. Three months later, 75% of girls her age were taller than her. Today, at 11 years of age, only 50% of girls her age are taller than her. This is consistent with research that shows a catch-up growth for children who were in orphanages and internationally adopted. When emotional deprivation and lack of love occur, physical growth slows down or stops. The body enters into a survival mode where vital, basic physiological functions are preserved at the cost of physical, mental, and social development. The longer the child is in survival mode, the more permanent and negative the effects will be. Once a child is adopted and the amount of love, care, and stimulation increases, the body ceases to be in survival mode and will start recuperating. My husband and I study anthropometry, the study of human body measurements, providing accurate biomedical information on health and nutritional status. We measure our daughter twice a year and compare the results with the World Health Organisation references. But we do not obsess over her measurements. She is a very healthy child, doing well at school in academic subjects, sports, and music. We are now happily bracing for adolescence. Our daughter’s experience mirrors that of thousands of other babies adopted into loving, well-off families. Increasing awareness on this issue is a step in the right direction, so that more orphaned children receive the happy ending my daughter did.

            "Paragraph: When a Native American named Jim Thorpe won the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, legend has it that King Gustav V of Sweden presented him the medal and said, \"You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.\" \"Thanks, king,\" Thorpe is rumored to have responded. Exactly 100 years later, at the 2012 Olympics in London, Oregon-native Ashton Eaton became the latest in a long line of American Olympians to win the gold medal in the decathlon. He had previously set the world record in the event at the US Olympic trials, but as with every decathlete since Thorpe’s win in 1912, it was winning the Olympic gold that earned Eaton the formidable title of the world’s greatest athlete. Queen Elizabeth II was not, unfortunately, in attendance to present Eaton with his medal. Spanning two days and 10 events, the decathlon is, and has always been, sports’ best objective measurement of sheer athleticism. And Eaton is so convincingly great at the 10-sport contest that his times and scores in certain single events are comparable, and often better, than those of track-and-field athletes competing exclusively in that one event. \"The decathlon is the only standardized test that covers a broad range of athleticism that is absolutely measurable, which I feel is great,\" Eaton told Business Insider this week while promoting his campaign with Chobani. \"You run the 100, you get a time. You do the long jump, you get a distance. You do the high jump, you get a height. You do a throw, you get a distance.\" Yet as the world’s greatest athlete, Eaton is not, of course, competing against every other great athlete in the world. Some of them are off dunking basketballs, or fighting in a ring, or doing whatever it is one does on an American Ninja Warrior course. Which brings us to the ageless water-cooler debate about the nature of athleticism: Of the A-list athletes playing major sports — the superstars we see splayed across billboards and magazine covers; the ones we hear TV commentators call \"athletic freaks\" — who, really, is the most athletic? We posed this question to Eaton, expecting to hear him praise the likes of LeBron James, or Mike Trout, or Russell Westbrook. Instead, he gave a surprising answer. \"I personally believe tennis is the next most athletic sport next to the decathlon,\" Eaton said. \"Just because of certain things required. Those matches are three or four hours long. There’s the technical aspect, the agility, the mind-body awareness. Not to mention the game itself is a little bit like a chess match.\" Watch Serena Williams approach the net for a swinging volley sometime and you can see where Eaton is coming from. But it’s still hard to believe that Novak Djokovic or Andy Murray, athletic as they undoubtedly are, really compare with the top NFL or NBA players. \"You can speculate all day, by what you perceive people to do, but I think there’s two aspects to athleticism. I think there’s the body, and then there’s definitely the mind,\" Eaton said. \"People like to just focus on the body part. I don’t think that’s a holistic approach.\" Plus, even with advanced metrics it’s still hard to quantify just how truly \"athletic\" a feat on a football or basketball field really is. \"You see somebody on a football field make a great, athletic 70-yard run, but the athleticism is immeasurable. It’s undoubtedly athletic, but compared to somebody else who did something else, how do you compare it? That’s the great part of track and field. It’s a test, but with results that you can compare to others.\" This is all well and good, but it doesn’t answer the question that has tantalized sports fans forever. Who is the world’s most athletic superstar? \"I don’t have one specific person that I think is the most athletic person,\" Eaton said. \"In my opinion, you’d have to do a really exhaustive study over a long period of time with really clearly defined metrics in order to get that.\" In other words, you’d want them to compete in a decathlon. So what if LeBron James announced he was competing in the event this summer, along with — or instead of! — his duties for USA Basketball? Wouldn’t Eaton be slightly worried? \"No, I wouldn't,\" Eaton said matter-of-factly. \"I have no doubt that anybody who did the first day of the decathlon would do great. The first day, yeah, is about being an athlete. But the second day you actually have to be a decathlete, and that’s the day where people show their true colors.\"\n",

But sometimes, there are some who can inspire humanity through their selfless acts of giving that can cross boundaries of caring for children other than their own. It is these guardian angels of love and mercy that bring a smile to the many orphans on this planet. One such woman is Lacey Dunkin, a woman who adopted six sisters. Certified to adopt from the age of 25. Lacey Dunkin from California took a huge step in life and despite of not being married, enrolled herself to become a foster parent. But she never realized what the future would bring by that one step of selflessness. 1 Lacey Badly Wanted To Be a Mother For Lacey becoming a mother was one of the most beautiful experiences of her life. And she loved kids and always wanted to have them. Although she did marry and had kids of her own, it was when she was younger that the eventful journey of being a foster mom began. Within four months of registering for adoption, she received a call to adopt four little girls, all sisters. Among Sophia, Natalia, Melanie and Kaylee, existed a fifth sibling a new born baby who unfortunately was given away to another foster home. Although Lacey was overwhelmed because here was not just one but four!! She said a big YES!! In fact for Lacey, she just wouldn’t consider adopting one or two of the girls, she didn’t want them separated and so she chose all four of them.

            "Paragraph: I Am Legend is the 2007 film adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name, starring Will Smith and a bunch of CG zombie things called Dark Seekers. As questionable as they looked, the irresistible draw of one of Hollywood's most bankable stars ripping around post-apocalyptic New York City proved well worth the ticket price for many filmgoers, making I Am Legend the highest-grossing film of the year. It raked in over $500 million worldwide, and Warner Bros. immediately greenlit a sequel, but it never happened. Here's why. Will Smith never really seemed into it Telling BBC News \"I don't want to be the sequel guy,\" Will Smith didn't have a problem shying away from the next I Am Legend chapter while it was in development. Technically, plans called for a prequel—but Smith had already done Bad Boys II and Men in Black II at this point, which makes his statement seem like a diplomatic way of turning down the role. Even with Smith's caginess, the studio, director Francis Lawrence, and writer Akiva Goldsman set about working on a follow-up. Pressed to define his level of involvement, Smith said, \"I'm not actually working on it. If it's great, I'm into it.\" Sounds like the script never achieved that level of greatness, because following Hancock and Seven Pounds, Smith's next project after a four-year hiatus was Men in Black III, which—if we're not mistaken—is a sequel. About that script Presumably, the studio's plans for a prequel over a sequel had a lot to do with the fact that Will Smith's character, Robert Neville, died at the end of the original film, which would make it a tad difficult to pick up the story where it left off. Instead, we were going to see \"the final days of humanity in New York before a man-made virus caused a plague that left Smith's character the lone survivor among a mutated mob in the city.\" Which sounds kind of cool, except the first movie already used flashbacks to show the military quarantine of the city, Neville valiantly deciding to stay behind, and then helplessly watching as his wife and daughter die in a helicopter crash during the evacuation. That kind of covers the dramatic beats leading up to his solitary existence in the original film, plus nothing is going to trump the visuals of an eerily desolate New York City. Okay, fine, no prequel. We'll do a sequel somehow—no, a reboot! Roughly four years after the prequel plans hit a dead end, Warner Bros. announced yet another deal with writer Akiva Goldsman to develop a sequel. According to Deadline, \"The film is not being called a prequel, which had been rumored for the past few years.\" With Will Smith still not on board, that presumably leaves us following supporting characters Anna and Ethan at the survivor's camp. Nobody wants to watch that, but half a billion in box office grosses don't fade easily from Hollywood's memory, so the next logical step is a reboot. At least they can sell it entirely on name recognition that way, regardless of how disconnected from the original story it might be. And just how far might it wander from the original film? How does \"a sci-fi version of The Searchers\" sound? Yep, we're talking about the John Wayne Western from the 1950s that follows a posse of cowboys on a mission to get revenge and retrieve a kidnapped girl. According to Deadline again, that's where the reboot currently sits, as a \"retrofitted version\" of Gary Graham's script for A Garden at the End of the World that they're slapping the I Am Legend label onto because \"the themes and mythology were similar.\" Hey, we heard you love Chipotle. Here's a bunch of Taco Bell burritos smashed into a tortilla and wrapped up in Chipotle foil. Same diff, right? Producer and writer Akiva Goldsman said it will never happen I Am Legend scribe and blockbuster-generator Akiva Goldsman had been the go-to guy for the sequel plans from the beginning, but even he apparently had his doubts about a new installment ever happening. He told io9, \"Oh no no, [there was] never a movie. I mean, we wrote a prequel [and] a sequel,\" which is not only confusing, but also confirms Warner Bros. was open to any possible way to make this thing. But he also said \"Then we did a sequel, that started with Neville again—and you realized that he was cloned.\" Oh, cool, so Neville sacrificing himself at the end of the original film didn't matter at all. He also talked about \"a dark seeker elephant,\" because the first movie had dogs, and elephants are bigger! Ultimately, his efforts on the project fizzled, \"It will never happen but we really enjoyed trying to make it happen,\" explained Goldman, who's moved on to projects like Transformers 7 & 8. Zombie fatigue Perhaps the main problem Warner Bros. has had while trying to come up with an idea that seems fresh—while still flying under the banner of an established property—is the fact that there have been approximately a gazillion zombie-related projects since 28 Days Later reignited the genre in 2002. Granted, I Am Legend was one of the more successful zombie flicks out of a solid group that includes Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland, and World War Z, but that was mostly due to its early position in the new zombie wave, as well as Will Smith's star power—both of which have significantly faded in recent years. Yes, The Walking Dead still draws solid ratings, but on the big screen, it's a different story. (For proof, see Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Or don't—no one else did.) As for Smith, he's had a string of duds that'll hopefully be snapped by Suicide Squad. Warner Bros. would be smart to just let this one go. After all...does anything really good ever come from resurrecting the dead? Nobody could handle another scene like when Sam died This is a completely unofficial reason for why this sequel hasn't come to fruition, but we stand by it entirely. We're talking about a general audience's inability to deal with another scene like the death of Sam, Neville's dog. While saving Neville from being torn apart by zombie dogs, she's infected by a bite. Neville's serum can't save her, and he has to strangle her before she turns in one of the most gut-wrenching moments in cinema history. It's amazing that a scene in which a dog dies trumps the emotionality of the scene in which the main character's entire family bites the dust, but that's exactly what happened there. If the sequel/reboot/ whatever-thing they're trying to make has anything that comes close to this, we're not interested—there are only so many tears a popcorn bucket can hold.'\n",

            "Paragraph: Another Spice Girls reunion may be in the works -- at least if Scary Spice has anything to say about it. Mel B recently spoke to The Daily Mail about the future of the beloved girl band and her hopes for a reunion. \"The truth is I was always the one that wanted the Spice Girls to continue. I didn’t want it to end and I still don’t,\" Mel B told the publication. \"Even though I’ve always had my own career going on, I’m always up for a reunion. Always.\" \"It’s a shame we’re not doing more as a band,\" the 38-year-old singer continued. \"There are no cogs turning right now but put it this way, there are always at least two of us talking about doing something. I spoke to Emma the other day; we’re all trying to get together for Mel C’s 40th in January, and we were saying how we’d like to go back on the road. If we were able to do the Olympics closing ceremony, getting on and doing rehearsals for three weeks, then I think anything is possible.\" As to whether a Spice Girls reunion would happen without Victoria Beckham, who has been less than enthusiastic about resurrecting her past as Posh Spice, Mel B commented, \"I don’t know. Maybe. It depends on what it is and when it is. With our 20th anniversary approaching in 2014 something is going to happen. Everyone knows I’m always championing a reunion. I truly believe it’ll happen sooner or later.\" Mel B has long been vocal about her desire to get back together with Beckham, Emma Bunton, Melanie C, and Geri Halliwell. In September, Mel B told Ellen DeGeneres that she had hopes for the band reuniting in the next year or two. The Spice Girls famously performed together for the first time in years at August 2012's Olympics Closing Ceremony in London.\n",

            "Topic: Dept of Transportation unveils plans to ease Metro Manila traffic\n",
            "Paragraph: The government is focusing its efforts on improving the public transportation system and changing citizens’ driving habits MANILA, Philippines – To solve Metro Manila’s traffic crisis – dubbed the worst on earth by navigation app Waze – the government is focusing its efforts on improving the public transportation system and changing citizens’ driving habits. Though the government has been hard at work to improve public transport around Manila, people need to start following traffic rules and regulations for any significant improvement to occur, Transportation Undersecretary Annelie Lontoc said in an interview on Monday, July 18. For starters, a more streamlined enforcement system is being tested on EDSA, Lontoc said. The government has divided the busy thoroughfare into 10 traffic zones, each with its own dedicated personnel from the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) to enforce traffic rules. Each of these zones will also have access to tow trucks, a quick response team on motorcycles, and personnel from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to help with illegally parked cars and \"colorum\" (out-of-line) vehicles. Despite all the government’s efforts, however, Lontoc insisted that peoples’ driving habits need to change before the traffic situation can improve. According to Lontoc, since the MMDA re-implemented the No Contact Apprehension Policy in April, more than 25,000 vehicles have been apprehended. \"We really need discipline,\" said Lontoc when asked about driving habits. \"We can’t just rely on enforcement. Car users need to follow the rules themselves. The roads are already so congested that anything that can stop traffic – like stalled vehicles – will cause it to accumulate.\" Overall, however, Lontoc believes that the traffic crisis can be resolved. \"If we maintain our lane, if we are defensive drivers, we can avoid it,\" she said, referring to congestion in the streets. \"As long as the road is moving, the cooperation of everyone to make the traffic flow is really a big deal,\" she added. Improvements coming to public transportation In relation to Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella’s statement that traffic in Metro Manila would improve within the next 100 days, Lontoc also said that, \"Within 100 days, we will restore the MRT and LRT to 2010 level, where there are 20 trains running.\" Regarding long-term plans for the train systems, Lontoc stated that the main goal was to increase the passenger capacity of these trains. Today, the train lines are only able to serve 350,000 passengers each day—a mere 3% of the over 12 million commutes made throughout Metro Manila daily. Over the next 3 years, Department of Transportation will work to procure more coaches, build extensions for LRT 1, LRT 2, and MRT 7, and invest heavily on infrastructure so as to serve a larger number of commuters across a wider range of areas. The Department is also in the process of deploying of cheap, safe, and well-maintained point-to-point buses, said Lontoc. The government hopes that by making these buses more comfortable and convenient – taking commuters from one location to another without any stops in between – more people will opt for public transport, reducing the number of cars on the road. Currently 25% of the people who take these buses have already made the shift from taking private vehicles, but the government intends to get that figure up to 50%. \"I’ve tried it myself and it’s very convenient,\" said Lontoc when asked about her experience on one of the new buses. \"It’s so much cheaper than bringing a car, and they even have free wifi, so I could check email on the way to work.\" Though these buses only cover 5 routes now (Alabang-Makati, Robinsons-Makati, Trinoma-Makati, SM Megamall-SM North & SM North-Makati), the government plans on rolling out additional vehicles along more routes in August. According to Undersecretary Lontoc, the government will also work on modernizing public utility vehicles like the jeepney. Through government financing, jeepneys around Metro Manila will get their engines replaced with newer models that run on more eco-friendly fuels. – Paco Tantoco / Rappler.com Paco Tantoco is a Rappler intern.\n",

            "Paragraph: RENTER: Katie Holmes LOCATION: New York City, N.Y. PRICE: $25,000 per month SIZE: (approx.) 2,400 square feet, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms YOUR MAMA’S NOTES: The lady property gossip at the New York Post reports that actress Katie Holmes has secured a modern-minded and fully furnished penthouse rental in New York City’s centrally located Chelsea nabe at a rate of $25,000 per month. The approximately 2,400-square-foot condominium, in a decidedly deluxe if architecturally nondescript full-service building and owned per property records by an investment banker who bought it in March 2005 for $2.45 million from retired Italian racecar driver Mauricio Flammini, has an open-plan layout that includes an unusually spacious and arguably space-wasting foyer with stone tile floor materials, smooth paneled walls and half a dozen small closets and storage cabinets. The main living space stretches a generous 35 feet and combines the kitchen, dining and lounge areas. There’s a wood-burning fireplace sheathed in hand set slate tiles, and the smallish but sleek kitchen accommodates a full-range of snazzy high-quality appliances, including an integrated espresso machine. An open-tread switchback staircase ascends to a jail cell-sized lounge that opens to a 200-plus-square-foot private terrace with outdoor shower space and panoramic city views from the Empire State Building to north and the new World Trade Center in the south. Officially, the penthouse has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and online marketing materials show one of the guest/family bedrooms has a custom-built Murphy bed and the other — labeled as a \"bedroom/library\" on the floor plan — has corner windows and floor-to-ceiling built-ins with low enclosed storage and open shelving. The master suite, set privately away from the other bedrooms and lined on at least two walls with stunning, matchbook pattern wood paneling, includes a dressing hall lined with wardrobes, a laundry closet with full-sized machines and a windowless bathroom with poured concrete two-sink vanity, ebony tiled walls, a heated towel rack and a glass-enclosed multi-head shower. This is not the first high-priced New York City rental for the former \"Dawson’s Creek\" star who produced and co-starred in the recently released silver screen drama \"Mania Days\" and who will portray Jacqueline Kennedy in an upcoming TV miniseries (\"The Kennedys After Camelot\"). In or around August 2012 she moved out of the $30 million-plus Beverly Hills mansion she shared with her now ex-husband Tom Cruise and holed up with their preternaturally fashion forward toddler, Suri, in a $12,500 per month rental at the so-called Chelsea Mercantile, which afforded her a convenient back door entrance into the Whole Foods located on the building’s ground floor as well as direct access to a subterranean parking garage that allowed her to evade paparazzi and the Scientology flacks who were widely reported at the time to surveil her. Last summer the slim and stylish single mother, who may or may not be romantically involved with Jamie Foxx, returned to Los Angeles, where she shelled out $3.375 million for a nearly 6,000-square-foot six bedroom and 6.5 bathroom residence — listing details described it as a \"Grand European Manor\" — in a guard-gated and celeb-favored development in Calabasas. Some of the other high-profile homeowners in the affluent suburban enclave include Michael Jackson’s mother and his three children; 1980s hair band star-turned-reality television regular Bret Michaels, whose house is currently for sale at $3.469 million; Khloe Kardashian, who bought her place last spring for $7.2 million from Justin Beiber; Kourtney Kardashian, who just this last weekend dumped her famously douchey boyfriend and baby daddy Scott Disick; and the Kardashian sisters’ 17-year-old half-sister Kylie Jenner, who just a few months ago paid $2.6 million for an architecturally pastiched residence of almost 5,000-square-feet and who, apropos of nothing, really, has admitted to having her teen-aged lips augmented with fillers and dates a 25-year old rapper and rent skipper named Tyga.

            "Paragraph: Data geeks have been responsible for some of our most important discoveries over the past few years, including high-value baseball players, the nation’s best burrito, and now this: The ideal age to get married. According to new research from The Institute Of Family Studies, it’s 32. The report swings (and mostly misses) as a bunch of explanations, but states definitively that \"prior to age 32 or so, each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds of divorce by 11 percent. However, after that the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent a year.\" That’s cool if you’re thinking about popping the question, but how does it align with previous research on the best age to have kids? According to multiple studies summarized in Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck? by Robin Marantz Henig and Samantha Henig, it depends on what you mean by \"best.\" Biologically, prime baby time for women is only ideal if they’re looking for a role on MTV’s Teen Mom. Kids born to 26-year-old moms are statistically least likely to have birth defects, but kids born to 32-year-olds have the lowest overall infant mortality. If you want to tie the decision to the mother’s long-term physical well being it gets even more complicated — the answer depends on if you’re talking about energy levels, ailments and aches, chronic illnesses, or overall health. To save your calculator thumb, know that the average nets out at 31. But also know that the best age for a woman to give birth, in terms of her overall life expectancy, is 34. That’s a lot of squishy data to divine a \"best\" age from, but how about this: Get married around 30 and then have your first kid before 32. Your marriage will last, your kid will have a long, healthy life, and your wife will ... have to sacrifice a few years on the back end. Well, \"best\" is a relative term, isn’t it?\n",

            "Paragraph: HBO Game of Thrones is pretty much a perfect show, and there’s so much going on in every episode that it’s hard to imagine anything might be missing. But after reading about a scene that almost came to be—and then didn’t—we’re having pangs of regret for all that could have been. Seriously, you guys, this would have been EPIC. Here are the deets: showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss revealed on a podcast that they originally had an idea for an incredible way to shoot a battle scene starring Peter Dinklage AKA Tyrion Lannister: \"Thinking back to season one, there was supposed to be this big battle [where] Tyrion Lannister follows The Mountain into combat—and we were really excited. We were going to have the camera at Peter Dinklage’s eye level and have him follow this giant, The Mountain, into battle and just see everything. Frankly, we just run out of money and we couldn’t do it. So that was one of the big battles from the book that we hoped we could get on screen and we never managed to do it.\" Can. You. Imagine? Not only was this a major battle scene that would have been amazing to see in the show, but to see it through Tyrion’s eyes? Beyond. If it’s any consolation, David and Dan don’t regret not doing the scene in hindsight. \"In a way, I think it’s probably better that we couldn’t do it, because it never would have measured up to what we were able to do later.\" (Case in point? This entire scene/battle/amazingness). via giphy True, but still, maybe we can hope for a recreation of this scene in the special features section of a boxed set of GoT someday?

            "Topic: Daniel Radcliffe On 'Kill Your Darlings' & Moving Beyond, But Not Forgetting, Harry Potter\n",
            "Paragraph: There's little doubt that if Daniel Radcliffe were a rock musician, his current press tour for \"Kill Your Darlings\" would have a title like \"The Moving On Tour '13\" or \"Harry In The Rearview Mirror.\" Yes, Daniel Radcliffe is no longer Harry Potter -- as a recent New York Times Magazine profile deftly illustrated -- but what's interesting about Radcliffe (great, even) is that he's not anti-Harry Potter. Here's your for instance: In \"Kill Your Darlings,\" Radcliffe plays a young Allen Ginsberg, who, at the outset of the Beat generation, finds his friend, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from. Not only do you have \"Kill Your Darlings\" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, \"Horns\" and \"The F Word.\" It's not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it's happening. I think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, \"Potter\" was the biggest thing that I'm ever going to do and I'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. But if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it's an amazing start to have had and it's something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. And I just have such fun doing my job, as well. Like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like \"The F Word\" and \"Kill Your Darlings.\" And I think there's definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don't really have peers when you're 12 or 13 that you look to in other films. When you're 16 or 17, you start becoming aware of guys like Aaron Johnson or Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw or James McAvoy. And you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, \"Oh, I want to do what they're doing. I want to have loads of different parts as well.\" So it builds up this desire to get out there. \"The Woman in Black\" felt like its narrative was basically, \"Here's Daniel Radcliffe's first post-Potter role,\" and now, with these, people have moved on. I think that's a really astute observation. I think that's completely true. \"The Woman in Black\" was a fantastic transition because it wasn't so different than Harry that people were like, \"Oh, he's just trying to shock us.\" But it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. And the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. I may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there's still stuff I see when I see that that's very reminiscent of Harry. I only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last \"Potter.\" So, it came very soon after. But I do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything I've done before. I just think I've grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years. And I think, as a consequence, my work's gotten better and I'm just looking forward to people finally seeing it because I feel like I've been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves. And you're playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream tastes. [Laughs] Yes. Yeah, I know what you mean. But, you know, I think that's what I liked about Potter and that's what I'm still very proud of about Potter. Even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. I think the reason I'm so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. That's not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. So, yeah, I still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise. Because, when I was growing up, I don't remember people talking about franchises before I was in one. I remember people talking about \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Potter\" would be like \"franchises\" that's the first time I remember ... Last time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched \"Star Wars.\" Yes. Well, except for \"The Phantom Menace.\" Let's not tell anyone that. You have to catch up before \"Episode VII\" comes out. I know! I know I do. I have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one. Because \"Star Wars\" is filming in Leavesden. There was at least one guy, Digby Milner, who worked on all the \"Potters\" who had also worked on \"Star Wars,\" the originals. And he will be working on new \"Star Wars\" at Leavesdon as well. And it is kind of amazing because \"Star Wars,\" the originals, were made in England as well. So there's a lot of that crew who we'll basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new \"Star Wars\" movie. It's come full circle. That's all they do at Leavesdon, apparently, is franchises [laughs]. \"Kill Your Darlings\" is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that's really not that well known. I mean, I didn't know the story at all. I really wasn't aware of it. That's one of the things that's so cool about it -- and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go, \"Wow.\" When you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known -- and, yet, this story has really never been told -- you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we've struck. Allen Ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he was told not to. Absolutely. Lucien, for reasons you understand when you see the film, did not want anyone to know this story. But I definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it: people didn't know. And one of the things I think people will like about this film that I think, perhaps, they won't expect is that when you hear \"1940s Beat poet historical drama,\" you sort of think, Oh, that sounds quite dry. But it's actually a lot of fun as well. I don't think you can make a movie about the Beats without having fun -- because they had a great fucking time. This might be a bad comparison, but it's got a superhero origin story feel to it, only with writers. Oh, I've said that a lot. Like when we're introduced to Jack Kerouac, it felt dramatic. And the first time we see Allen's name in the film is on his university application. [Director] John Krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous person's name, but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university. What was your reaction when you heard J.K. Rowling was revisiting the \"Harry Potter\" universe with \"Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them\"? Were you surprised? I had never heard her say \"no.\" I don't think any of us would ever be foolish enough to, you know, say never. But, I think with Jo, I wasn't really surprised. It kind of made sense to me actually, when it was announced. Because I was kind of like, \"OK, yeah, she's gone off and had 'Casual Vacancy' and then done the Robert Galbraith books -- and both have been very successful. And I imagine that has given her a confidence of, \"Oh, OK, now that I stepped away from it, I can actually go back to it with confidence.\" And I think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the \"Potter\" world. And, yeah, she's wants to give people what they want. And I think it will be really good. I'm just relieved that it's in her hands, to be honest. That lets me know that it's not anyone just cashing in and it's going to be authentic. She doesn't need the money. She definitely doesn't need the money.

            "Paragraph: People who live in the greater Toledo, Ohio, area are being urged not to drink water from the tap. The city's water supply may be contaminated by a toxin harmful to humans. Health officials for Toledo issued the advisory overnight Friday into Saturday after readings at a water treatment plant revealed an excessive amount of microcystin. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) also declared a state of emergency in Lucas County, according to the Toledo Blade. The water advisory affects about 400,000 people. While healthy adults should be able to bathe and shower without issues, residents are warned not to drink or boil the water. Boiling water contaminated with microcystin will only make the toxin more harmful. Ingestion of microcystin may cause abnormal liver function, as well as diarrhea, vomiting, numbness or dizziness. The city is also recommending that restaurants and food facilities that use tap water suspend their operations until health officials give the all clear. Officials believe the toxin stems from a harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie, one source of the city's drinking water supply. Though the bloom is concentrated in the western basin near Toledo, it could affect water supplies for other cities situated near the lake. Residents of southeast Michigan who live near Toledo are also being advised not to drink the water. So far, no illnesses have been reported, according to Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins, but health authorities are waiting for the results of water testing from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, expected at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. \"We hope the tests come back and that we are not in the dire strait we fear we might be in,\" Collins told CNN. \"We are erring on the side of caution.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: It hasn't taken Eden Hazard long to get back to his best under Antonio Conte. The Belgian's poor form was one of Chelsea's biggest problems last season as they stumbled to a lacklustre 10th-placed finish. Fast forward a few months and the 25-year-old is helping them challenge for the title again. Something clearly went badly wrong under Jose Mourinho. Hazard picked up a little after Christmas once the Special One had been fired, but he still never looked close to the player that won PFA Player of the Year two years ago. Under Conte, though he's now scored three goals in as many games, compared to the four he managed in the whole of last season. It goes without saying that the new manager's arrival has done him the world of good, but the humble Italian believes there's a bit more to it than that. When asked about the reasons for Hazard's revival, Conte told reporters, via Goal.com: \"I think that Eden is playing now more close to the goal. \"He's participating more in offensive situations. I think it's better for him, this type of situation, which sees him staying in a position where he can finish easier compared to in the past. Hazard's on fire \"For this reason, I think and I want Eden to continue in this way. We know his talent. He's a fantastic player. Also, I found a player who is working very well without the ball, working very well with the team.\" You know you're having a good season when you start being compared to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. OK, so Hazard isn't quite in that league yet, but many are already suggesting he could be one day if he continues getting better and better. \"Who knows? [if he can reach Ronaldo or Messi’s level]\", Conte added. \"We all know the great talent of Eden. I think he must continue to work and to improve his talent, but in this moment he's putting his talent, putting himself, in the team. \"I know Eden is a player with a great talent. A great player. I knew him against the national team very well, because we played a friendly game against Belgium and also in the European Championship. \"Now I'm pleased to see him every day and, above all, to have him in my team.\" Is Hazard anywhere near Ronaldo and Messi's level? Will he be one day? Have your say in the comments.\n",

            "Paragraph: Jerusalem - Tucked away on a steep, potholed street in Sur Baher, a suburb in the southeastern hills of Jerusalem, Sarah Ali Dwayat's apartment sits empty. On the front porch, a large banner bears the photographs of five teenagers from the neighbourhood currently imprisoned by Israel. One of them is her 19-year-old son, Abed. The group stands accused of throwing stones at Israeli vehicles on a highway, allegedly causing the death of a driver, after clashes between police and Palestinian youths last September, on the eve of the Jewish New Year. The trial is still going on, but already some of their family members have been forced from their homes - the victims of new measures ostensibly aimed at deterring alleged Palestinian attackers. \"When we got the confiscation notice, we took all the furniture out, and now it's scattered with friends and neighbours,\" Sarah said, pushing back a metal sheet covering one window to sneak a look inside. Doorknobs to the home have been broken off, and entrances sealed with melted metal plates. Sarah, a widow for 15 years, and her 24-year-old daughter have moved to a smaller apartment in the same area, provided by a neighbour as a goodwill gesture. Sooner or later, they will have to start paying rent again, Sarah acknowledged - and with property prices sky-high in Jerusalem, they will not be able to afford it. \"We had just started renovation work. Abed had found a job and had started to help. We are still paying the debts,\" Sarah, 59, told Al Jazeera. \"When they came to seal the house [last month], a soldier told me, in Arabic, that it was to send a message to others, so they wouldn't carry out more acts of terror.\" Since last October, tensions have boiled over into violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the blockaded Gaza Strip. During this period, the Israeli army has killed at least 206 Palestinians, including protesters, bystanders and alleged attackers, while 33 Israelis have been killed in stabbing and shooting incidents. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a series of measures directed at alleged Palestinian attackers and their families, including the demolition or sealing of attackers' homes and the revocation of permanent residency status for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem. Munir Nusseibeh, a human rights lawyer and director of the Community Action Centre at al-Quds University, believed that Sarah's son and two of his co-accused, Muhammad Abu Kaf, 17, and Mustafa Atrash, 18, were \"test cases\". Israel's interior minister issued a decision to strip all three of their Jerusalem residency in January, a move that is now being appealed in court. \"They are the first at risk of residency revocation for throwing stones, and the first whose families have been displaced from their homes for throwing stones,\" Nusseibeh told Al Jazeera. Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return. Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel? Abu Walid, father of Mustafa Atrash, who is on trial over stone-throwing allegations A letter to Abed's lawyer from the Israeli Interior ministry states that \"a permanent residency status in Israel is based on a material connection between the resident and the state\" and that it \"requires basic commitment and loyalty in view of the fact that residency, and all the more so permanent residency, is not a status which only grants rights without any obligations\". When Israel occupied and unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, Palestinians were designated as \"permanent residents\" rather than citizens of the state, a status akin to that of migrants in a foreign country. Since then, over 14,000 have had their residency revoked. Over the years, the criteria for revoking residency have broadened. Two decades ago, Israel's interior ministry revoked the residency of Palestinians who lived abroad for seven or more years, or who obtained residency or citizenship status in another country. But after the Oslo Accords, a new policy was introduced whereby Palestinians would lose residency rights if they established their \"centre of life\" outside of Israel - such as in the West Bank or Gaza. Some 11,000 out of the 14,000 had their residency revoked under this policy. In 2006, three elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council had their Jerusalem residency revoked on new grounds: \"breach of allegiance to the state\". Their case is still pending before the Supreme Court. \"No one was arguing that these parliamentarians posed a specific security threat to Israel, but rather it was because of their political belonging that they decided to cancel their right to live in Jerusalem,\" Nusseibeh said, noting that there are 13 known cases of residency revocation under the allegiance criteria. \"If the Supreme Court approves the residency revocations in the 2006 case based on breach of allegiance, this will make a new important precedent - it will be the first time that the Supreme Court approves revoking residency based on political, rather than security reasons,\" Nusseibeh said. \"All Palestinians in Jerusalem will be at risk of residency revocation according to the allegiance criteria, because Palestinians in East Jerusalem see the occupation as temporary and Israel as a foreign occupying power.\" Abu Walid, the father of Mustafa Atrash, was indignant at this policy. \"Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel?\" he added, referring to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli extremist in 1995. Abir Joubran-Dakwar, a lawyer for the Israeli human rights organisation Hamoked who is working on the Sur Baher case, noted that there are a number of specific criteria under which citizenship can be revoked, including \"breach of allegiance\". However, this does not apply to residency, she said: \"A person who has his citizenship revoked becomes stateless, but the interior ministry will still have to give him a permanent residency status.\" Israel's interior ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on the matter. At the end of April, Israel's attorney-general temporarily suspended the revocation in the Sur Baher case, until the Supreme Court comes to a decision in the 2006 case. Human rights groups, including B'Tselem, have argued in the past that home demolitions, denial of building permits, restrictions on family reunification, and the building of the separation wall are all among the variety of methods used by Israel to forcibly displace Palestinians and maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, in violation of international law. \"I believe the aim of this policy is to add a new method for the displacement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, to be able to displace even larger numbers,\" Nusseibeh said. \"That's our concern.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: We’re all seen dogs that look like their owners, but our kinship with man’s best friend just got a little deeper. It turns out that dogs can mirror their owners’ personality, according to research published in journal PLOS ONE. More specifically, they pick up on their owner’s anxiety and negativity. Researchers from Austria tested and observed 132 owners and their dogs. They asked the owners about their own, and their dog’s, personalities, and the owner about their social attitudes to their dog and towards other humans. They filmed the dogs and their owners to observe their behaviour in one play session, and two threatening situations. They also measured their heart rate, and tested their stress hormone cortisol through their saliva. They found that owners and dogs influence each other’s stress levels and coping mechanisms, with owners being more influential than their dogs. So the more anxious and neurotic a person, the more likely it is that their dog will be the same. The study states: Dogs are sensitive to their owners ́ emotional states, and emotional contagion between owners and dogs is possible. Thus, dogs may mirror the anxiety and negative expectations of neuroticistic owners.\n",

But those two do not even make the list of the top 10 most expensive cities in which to live. Instead, it's dominated by Asian and African cities, as well as two Swiss ones- Zurich and Geneva- according to Mercer's annual '2016 Cost of Living Rankings.' Published on Wednesday, the guide surveys 209 countries where employees are most likely to send their expatriates to live and work. Hong Kong remains the world's most expensive city, where the average monthly rent of a unfurnished two-bedroom apartment of \"international standards in an appropriate neighborhood\" costs $6,809.47. Second place may surprise you – rent in Luanda, Angola, will cost you $6,700 a month. According to the World Economic Forum, \"Luanda may not be the most expensive city in the world for the local population, but thanks to a booming oil economy, a limited supply of luxurious housing, and a high demand for it among expats...The cost of an apartment in Luanda for an Angolan household may well be just $200 a month. But that cost is discarded when looking at the cost for expats... expat cost of living varies wildly from those of locals for two fundamental reasons: supply and demand.\" Compare that to Sydney for example, where a similar apartment would cost $2,636.39, or Vancouver, where monthly rent for a two-bedroom is approximately $1,737.80. Move to London or New York, and you'll see average two-bedroom rents of $4,583.25 and $5,1000, respectively. Should you decide to go see a movie in any of these cities, and London is by far the most expensive – a ticket will set you back $17.91. Go to the movies in Johannesburg, and you'll only have to fork out a little over $4. Fancy sitting down for a cup of coffee? You'll pay almost $8 in Hong Kong but only $2.28 in New York. And if you're driving to get that cup of coffee, one liter of unleaded gasoline will cost you around the $1 range in most cities – although you'll pay $1.79 in Hong Kong versus $0.48 in Moscow.

But is the hype legit? According to Lawson, there are tons of benefits to metcon workouts, including improved fat loss, increased calorie burn compared to steady-state workouts, muscular strength gains, and improved cardiovascular function. And one 2012 study in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism found that HIIT workouts boost metabolism better than cardio alone. Even better? Going all-out in a metcon workout can help you improve your work capacity, making your body more efficient for all those other activities you love doing, says Lawson. \"In other words, you’ll have an increased ability to lift more weights , and go for longer periods of time and distances without getting tired,\" he says. \"Basically, becoming a more awesome human overall.\" Try It Yourself While there are tons of great metcon classes out there to choose from, you don’t have to shell out tons of cash on a fancy gym membership to give this workout a try.

Lawson suggests choosing three or four exercises and cycling through them with little rest between rounds (or none at all!) for a predetermined number of rounds. The more muscle groups each move works, the better. Try this: 5 dumbbell goblet squats 10 jumping jacks 5 dumbbell push presses 5 medicine ball slams Rest for zero to 30 seconds rest between exercises, and zero to 60 seconds of rest between rounds. (The more fit you are, the less rest you’ll need.) Repeat three to five times depending on your level of fitness. When you first get going, Lawson suggests starting with just three of the exercises above instead of all four. Decreasing the number of total rounds you complete, as well as increasing the amount of rest time between each exercise, will allow you to work your way up to more intense workouts in a safe yet effective way, says Lawson. (Here's how to tell if your workouts class is too hard .) \"These workouts are intense because of the fast-paced, minimal rest nature of them, so err on the side of caution and use less weight than you’d normally would so you don’t gas out too fast,\" he says. \"You can always scale up later.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Smoking can kill, we all know that -- but it does something else to the very fundamental coding of your body you might not expect. An alarming new study shows that it’s not just cancer, heart disease and other ailments we have to worry about when it comes to smoking: lighting up can also alter our DNA. A new study has found that smoking alters more than 7,000 genes in ways that may contribute to the development of these diseases, and don’t go away completely even when we stop smoking. Scientists based their conclusions on results from blood samples taken from 16,000 people in 16 other studies, finding that those who stopped smoking saw their genes recover for the most part within five years of quitting, showing that the sooner you stop smoking, the better. But the research team, led by Dr. Stephanie London of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Science, also found that some genetic changes remains 30 years later, according to the study. The researchers looked at a process called DNA methylation, which are genetic changes that don’t alter the underlying cold but can change how they are expressed. Decades after smokers quit, there was still a higher long term risk of common smoking related diseases. \"We used a pregnancy cohort called the Norwegian Mother and Child Study, or MoBa2 for short,\" London said in a recent podcast. \"And we used cord blood samples from the study. Cord blood is collected at birth from the baby, so it’s the baby’s DNA. And we looked at whether there are methylation changes that are related to whether or not the baby’s mother smoked. And we were very interested to find, even though we looked in a very hypothesis-free way, that some of the genes that came to the top were ones that we had previously known were very important in the response to compounds that are in tobacco smoke, and in particular, two genes that are in the AhR signaling pathway.\"\n",

The official reveal trailer of the game has garnered over more than 3 million dislikes on YouTube since it was uploaded on May 2nd. In the interview with Mashable at E3, Eric Hirshberg confirmed that the company hasn’t changed anything in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare after the initial fan response, which was overwhelmingly negative, especially on YouTube. He said, \"We’re doing the same thing after the response as before, which is focusing on making a great game.\" \"At the end of the day, when we do that we tend to make fans happy and win people over and continue to have the franchise flourish,\" he added. Hirshberg also mentioned the fact that even Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 received negative responses initially but went on to become the best selling Call of Duty game ever. Black Ops 2 was also disregarded by fans before release because of the futuristic setting of the game. \"Our previous most-disliked trailer was the reveal trailer for Black Ops 2,\" Hirshberg said. \"[That was] the first time we brought the franchise into the future. And that turned out to be one of our most successful games ever.\" Hirshberg said, \"The franchise has never been stronger than it is right now in terms of the number of people we have online playing. Black Ops 3 is doing great. We’ve managed to keep it relevant and fresh longer than many people thought we could.\" The CEO also stressed on the fact that the dislikes on YouTube didn’t affect the pre-order numbers of the game. Interestingly, he pointed out that the negative reactions were mostly restricted to YouTube, and the trailer for the game was mostly well received on other social media platforms, including Facebook. He said, \"We didn’t see that reaction on other platforms and in other metrics.We didn’t see it in our pre-order momentum, we didn’t see it even in the same exact [trailer posting] on other platforms, like Facebook.\" \"It was unique.\" Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare managed to impress with its E3 presentation, where it showed off some amazing single-player gameplay footage. However, there’s been a total blackout as far as the game’s multiplayer is concerned, but the company’s expected to showcase it during its upcoming Call of Duty XP event in September.\n",

            "Topic: These Streetlights Are Great For The Planet — But Horrible For Your Health\n",
            "Paragraph: Tree-lined streets, good schools, quiet road and low-intensity streetlights... That last one may not have made it on your checklist for finding your last home, apartment or condo, but doctors now say it probably should have. Even though they save energy, some light-emitting diode (or LED) streetlights are too bright and may actually be putting your health and security at risk, according to new recommendations from the American Medical Association, the largest professional association of doctors in the U.S. The benefits of LED lights include a lot of energy and cost savings. They use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional lights. And the lifetime of LED lights is two to four times that of older, non-LED lights, which means lower maintenance costs for cities that need to change a street’s lightbulbs when they go out. But the bottom line from the AMA is that high-intensity LED streetlights that emit too much blue light can actually throw off sleep patterns of the people living in those neighborhoods and make nighttime glare on roads worse than conventional lights. \"Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,\" Maya A. Babu, an AMA board member, said in press release. None of the authors of the AMA recommendations were answering questions on the topic, according to the press office. 'A Strip Mall In Outer Space' \"It feels like I’m in a strip mall in outer space,\" Brooklyn resident Jolanta Benal told The New York Times last year, complaining about the bright LED streetlights in her Windsor Terrace neighborhood. New York City is spending $75 million to retrofit its more than 250,000 street lights to be energy-efficient LEDs, the Times reported. The new lights are expected to save the city $6 million in energy costs and $8 million in maintenance each year. But lights like these could also be costing residents like Benal a lot of sleep. The retrofitted streetlights were designed to prevent glare, according to a spokesperson for the city's Department of Transportation. But the current blue light allowance for the new street lights is higher than the new AMA recommendations call for. \"The problem is that if people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep,\" Maurice Ohayon, director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center, told The Huffington Post. Ohayon and his colleagues recently looked at the sleep habits and sleep quality of more than 15,800 people. They found that people who were exposed to more nighttime light were nearly twice as likely to be dissatisfied with their sleep as those living in areas with less light. Those exposed to more light at night also reported sleeping less at night and having more fatigue during the day. If people are not exposed to darkness in the evening then they have a problem going to sleep. Maurice Ohayon, Stanford University As that exposure to light happens over and over again, our circadian rhythms (the body’s internal clock) get disrupted. And beyond affecting sleep, disordered circadian rhythms are linked to higher rates of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, depression and some cancers. In the same way that blue light from a smartphone or computer screen suppresses melatonin production in the brain (the body’s signal for sleep), it's the blue light in LEDs that causes trouble, Clete Kushida, a neurologist and sleep specialist at Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, explained in a KBCW video. Blame Light Color And Intensity There is actually no such thing as a \"white\" LED light, Stephen Quick, an architect and urban designer, told HuffPost. LED lights that appear white, like the ones used in streetlights are made up of a combination of amber, red, green and blue light, said Quick, an adjunct professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in writing the AMA's recommendations. Quick and his colleagues took a deep dive into the research on cost-saving benefits and potential health, safety and aesthetic concerns of LED lights for a report for the city of Pittsburgh in 2011. The report was used to help Pittsburgh finalize its plan to replace its 40,000 streetlights. That research, like the new AMA recommendation, suggested that a neutral color light with about an even mix of blue and the other colors be used for streetlights, Quick said. \"Think incandescent light -- neither warm nor cool [in color]. It’s soft, but it doesn’t have the cool qualities that you’d see in a fluorescent light.\" Quick said that the Pittsburgh report's recommendations did allow for slightly more blue light than the AMA. Brighter But Not Safer The other potential problem with LED streetlights that are too bright, according to the AMA’s recommendation against them, is glare. \"A lot of people believe that the brighter the lights, the safer they are,\" Quick said. But LED light is directional -- meaning it gets emitted in a specific direction, unlike conventional lightbulbs, which put out light and heat in all directions. When the lights are lower consistently, we don’t have the glare problem we do when they’re really bright. Stephen Quick, Carnegie Mellon University Because the light is not diffused, LEDs create a \"glare zone\" for drivers at certain angles that can be worse than conventional streetlights, Quick said. The new AMA recommendations encourage \"proper design, shielding and installation\" to help mitigate glare. Quick also said that dimming the lights would help reduce glare. \"The higher the intensity, the more glare from the bounced light or the direct light,\" he said. \"And when the lights are lower consistently, we don’t have the glare problem we do when they’re really bright.\" The Cost Of Evolving Standards The AMA's new recommendations may call for some rethinking of current green building standards and projects. The U.S. Green Building Council -- the group that runs LEED, the most widely used green building certification program in the world -- does not support one specific type of streetlight over another, Theresa Backhaus, a site technical specialist for LEED, told HuffPost via email. \"We encourage lighting design to take all considerations into account for the health, safety and welfare of people and the environment,\" she said. USGBC's Light Pollution Reduction Credit was created precisely to reduce the harmful effects of light pollution, she said. The credit is one that buildings and development projects can meet to earn one of LEED's four rating levels. That credit requires projects to use lower lighting levels for \"sensitive areas,\" such as residential zones and nature preserves, but does not specify a limit on the amount of blue light that can be used. The good news is that most LEDs, especially newer ones, are made with dimming controls, Quick said -- so the intensity of the light can be adjusted fairly easily. Changing the color balance of the lights can be a lot more difficult. Sometimes it's possible to replace just the LED themselves, Quick said, but sometimes the whole fixture needs to be replaced. \"And that gets costly.\" The takeaway is that there’s nothing inherently bad about the LED lights themselves. \"We save a tremendous amount of energy by using them. We also save a lot of money in maintenance costs,\" Quick said. But getting the color and intensity right is important. \"The best procedure right now is for cities to be cautious and know what they’re buying,\" he added.\n",

Much to their surprise, Norah picked her head up as she lay on the side of the highway, all alone. Norah was notoriously elusive, and wouldn’t let humans near. The team would watch with baited breath as Norah crossed the busy Texas highways, back and forth, walking the streets. Finally, after several weeks of trying to trap Norah, they succeeded. They realized she looked a lot thinner than usual, and were shocked to learn that Norah had been pregnant! Just a few days before her rescue, Norah had given birth to nine tiny puppies! She’d been hiding them in the courtyard of a nearby church, safe inside the shrubs and bushes. That’s right – of all the nearby places, Norah and her pups took refuge at the United House of Prayer. Once the entire family was back at the rescue, Norah continued to nurse and bond with her babies – only now, they had a warm, safe environment and were off the streets for good.

            "Paragraph: Some of the world's biggest companies and iconic landmarks are suddenly missing three key letters from their names: A's, B's and O's. And it's all part of a massive effort to encourage people around the globe to donate blood. Continue Reading \"Without A's, O's and B's, we're nowhere. Help fill in the gaps,\" said this ad for the #MissingType campaign. First, some background. The #MissingType campaign is spearheaded by the U.K.'s National Health Service. It started last year to inspire those who had never given blood before to sign up as donors. And it was pretty successful — the campaign says it got more than 30,000 people to donate. This year, some pretty big-name companies from 21 different countries are participating. Like Morgan Stanley, which put up this huge display in New York City's Times Square. And Tesco in the U.K. dropped the O from its name to show its support. Even the Sydney Opera House took part. The NHS hopes the campaign will help draw attention to the shortage in blood donations across the globe. According to the World Health Organization, only about 33 of every 1,000 people in high-income countries give blood. And that number is even lower for middle- and low-income countries. And 74 countries get more than 90 percent of their blood supply from voluntary donors, according to the WHO. The #MissingType campaign ends Aug. 21.\n",

            "Paragraph: When it comes to posing for Vogue covers, there's no denying that Kate Moss knows what she's doing. But directing the fashion spreads inside the glossy? Well, that's a whole new project... one it seems the 33-time cover girl is eager to embark on. British Vogue announced today that Moss will make her mark on the magazine's masthead, joining the publication as a \"contributing fashion editor,\" beginning with \"a forthcoming spring issue.\" This reminds us of Carla Bruni's guest-editorship of Vogue Paris last winter -- except way better. First off, this isn't a guest spot, but a recurring role. And Kate's not just a fashionable lady, she's an industry veteran who has proven adept at modeling, designing and even singing (well, sort of). As a matter of fact, editing might be one of the few creative pursuits she hasn't tried. The question remains: How well will Kate's captivating presence translate behind the lens, where she won't have those stunning facial features to fall back on? Vogue UK's Alexandra Shulman has faith: \"Her undoubtedly brilliant sense of style, depth of fashion knowledge and understanding of what makes a wonderful image will be exciting to see on the pages of British Vogue,\" she told her magazine this morning. \"I am really looking forward to working with her on ideas.\"\n",

She tweeted her story, which should be a warning to all: STORY TIME Gather round, Twitter, and I shall tell you the tale of instant gross justice I once dated a terrible man who was awful &horrible &I shouldn't have dated him. You know the type. Just picture \"awful,\" that's him. One of the horrible things about this man was that he didn't listen to me. Ever. Even if he asked a question, he'd ignore the answer. One night we were at a family member's house and he spotted something curious lying on the coffee table. \"What's that?\" he asked. \"Don't touch it,\" I said, even as he reached for the thing on the table. Did he listen? What do you think, reader? He grabbed it &started to fiddle with it. \"Put that down, you don't want to touch it\" I said. \"But what is it?\" he asked, still fiddling. \"It's -- put it down, don't touch that button,\" I said. What do you imagine he did? Reader, he raised the thing in his hand to eye level, looked right at me, and touched the button I was trying to save him from himself. I really was. But it all happened so fast, there wasn't time for me to explain what the thing was. Twitter, if y'all have ever watched television, you have probably seen a commercial for The Ped Egg The Ped Egg, for the uninitiated, is a little egg-shaped device. It's hollow. On the underside, there's a little foot grater. You can use the Ped Egg to grate off the crusty, barnacled undersides of your gnarled-up feet. The egg part catches the foot shavings. You can really collect a lot of foot shavings if you are a dedicated foot-grater and use your Ped Egg on the daily as my relative did (my apologies to everyone who If you don't empty your Ped Egg frequently, it can get *pretty much packed* with foot shavings (sorry) Back to the story. My ex raised the thing to eye level, looked at me, and pushed the button. And the thing in his hand sprang open. My relative's foot shavings ERUPTED from within the Ped Egg like an explosion of flesh confetti \"What was that?!\" he yelled, frantically slapping at his face, trying to whisk the foot crumbs out of his eyelashes I was laughing so hard that I was in very real danger of peeing myself and the only word I managed to choke out was \"feet\" THAT is why you ALWAYS listen to your girlfriend. Because if you don't, you end up with a foot in your mouth. And nose.

            "Paragraph: If you believe the conclusions that have been reached by some tech bloggers and smartphone fans following early iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus leaks, this year’s new iPhone models are going to be boring. Forget the fact that absolutely nothing has been confirmed at this point and forget the fact that we have yet to hear anything about new features that Apple might plan to introduce alongside its new iPhone models. Boring... You’re crazy if you think we already know all there is to know about Apple’s next-generation iPhones. Even if we operate under the assumption that everything we’ve seen so far is accurate, what new flagship feature is Apple cooking up for this year’s launch? What exactly is that dual camera setup going to do on the iPhone 7 Plus? And what about the Smart Connector on the back? There are plenty more unknowns as well, and more puzzle pieces will undoubtedly fall in place in the coming weeks and months. Case in point: A fresh leak on Wednesday may have revealed a major change that we never saw coming. MUST SEE: My 5 favorite new iOS 10 features that no one is talking about Back in late May, we enjoyed what was likely our first look at a real iPhone 7. The phone certainly doesn’t appear to feature a revolutionary redesign of any kind, but it does look like it improves upon the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s design in a number of key ways. Namely, it’s thinner and it sports less offensive antenna lines. But around front, things may be an entirely different story. A new photo posted by MobiPicker shows us what the gadget blog claims to be the front of an iPhone 7. The authenticity of the image isn’t confirmed, but it shows a huge change that hasn’t previously been reported by any solid sources. Here’s the photo in question: Let’s look a bit closer: Now, we’ve known for some time that Apple is hard at work trying to remove the home button from its iPhone and iPad lineup. The company has been awarded a number of patents for technology that might allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint sensor beneath a device’s display. As a result, Apple would be able to build much more compact devices since it wouldn’t need so much room beneath the screen. The iPhone 7 might be the first big step toward realizing that goal. In the leaked photo, the iPhone 7’s home button doesn’t appear to be a button at all. Instead, it looks like a touch sensitive tap target with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor embedded beneath it. And in all likelihood, if this photo does show a real iPhone 7 — and that’s a big \"if\" — the new capacitive home button will support 3D Touch as well. This would let Apple release a device that still supports all of the same home button features as earlier models, including things like Reachability and Siri, without the need for a physical button. With reports stating that early iPhone 7 production is already underway, we probably won’t have to wait long before this rumor is either corroborated or disproven by subsequent leaks.\n",

            "Paragraph: It's amazing to think that just 10 years ago, flat-rate digital music streaming services were a mere gleam in the eye of industry executives. It was as recently as September 2007 that Rick Rubin, then co-head of Columbia Records, put forward the idea as a way of combating online music piracy and file-sharing. \"You'd pay, say, $19.95 a month, and the music will come from anywhere you'd like,\" he told the New York Times. \"In this new world, there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car, from your cell phone, from your computer, from your television.\" As it turned out, he was essentially describing Spotify, which launched just over a year later. He even got the price right. In those heady days, when the pound was a lot stronger, $19.95 was equivalent to £10, which, give or take a penny, is the monthly cost of Spotify Premium in the UK today. But Spotify is yet to make a profit, while plans to float the firm on the stock market have reportedly been delayed, raising a big question mark over its business model. Industry accolade Of course, Spotify isn't the only streaming platform out there. Others have joined it over the past decade, including Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Deezer, as well as high-resolution music services Tidal and Qobuz. But Spotify is seen as the leader, with more than 100 million users, 40 million of them paid-up subscribers to its Premium tier. The Swedish firm is now a major player in 60 countries, including the world's biggest music market, the US, where streaming accounted for 51% of music consumption last year. Reflecting the huge impact that Spotify has had, its chief executive, Daniel Ek, has just topped US music industry magazine Billboard's latest Power 100 list of the biggest movers and shakers in the business. \"For the first time since [former file-sharing service] Napster decimated music sales, the recorded music industry is showing signs of growth, and that reversal of fortune is largely due to one man,\" Billboard said in its citation. The magazine also hailed Spotify as \"the place fans discover music as well as consume it\", pointing to its promoted playlists, including its Discover Weekly service. Royalty woes However, the clock is ticking for Spotify as it hatches its plans to go public. The firm originally planned to float this year, but according to the TechCrunch website, this could now be delayed until 2018. There are various issues behind this move, not least of which is that Spotify needs to conclude new long-term licensing deals with the big three record companies - Universal, Sony and Warner - to avoid the risk of suddenly losing major chunks of its content. It's thought that Spotify currently pays 55% of its revenue to record labels in royalties, with additional money going to music publishers. In the interest of finally becoming a profitable company, it would like to lower that percentage, but this is unlikely to go down well with artists, who argue that the royalties they receive from streaming are unfairly low as it is. Brutal arithmetic But if it waits too long before floating, it could face a serious cash crisis. In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once the initial public offering (IPO) of shares takes place. However, under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the IPO happens. So as time goes on, Spotify must pay ever larger sums to its creditors just to settle the interest on its loan, while the amount of money it can raise from its IPO is trimmed by an ever greater amount. Unless Mr Ek can get the better of this brutal arithmetic, the future looks tough for Spotify. But at the same time, as Billboard says, \"the entire music business now has an interest in its success\". \"If it's not already too big to fail, it's headed in that direction quickly,\" concludes the magazine.\n",

            "Paragraph: 'The scene was horrible - especially seeing children wailing and dying in front of you,' says Abd Alkader Habak Distressing images of a man carrying an injured child away from a burning vehicle and another of him weeping next to a boy’s body have emerged from a bombing of a bus convoy that targeted Syrian civilians over the weekend. Photographer Abd Alkader Habak can be seen in one of the images, running away from the scene of the attack with a small boy in his arms. The pictures were shared by the Aleppo Media Centre, an umbrella group of anti-regime journalists and activists. Mr Habak told CNN that he had been documenting the evacuation of civilians from the besieged towns of Kefraya and Foua, held by forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.   As buses passed through Rashidin in rebel territory to a town near Aleppo, the blast occured, briefly knocking him unconscious, he said.  \"The scene was horrible - especially seeing children wailing and dying in front of you,\" he said. \"So I decided along with my colleagues that we'd put our cameras aside and start rescuing injured people.\" The first child he checked was dead, he added. The next was breathing raggedly, so Mr Habak picked him up and ran towards the nearest ambulance.  In a second image, Mr Habak is seen kneeling and sobbinh next to the corpse of a dead child, unable to take in what he is witnessing.  The heartbreaking photos, which have been shared online thousands of times, are just one insight into the horrors faced by the Syrian families that day. Families which left the two towns besieged by al Qaeda affiliated rebels after more than two years of enduring mortar fire, snipers and limited food and medical supplies did not make the decision lightly. Many had to leave loved ones behind.  The Qatar and Russia brokered deal also allowed the reciprocal passage of citizens of opposition towns Madaya and Zabadani to pass safely to rebel-controlled Idlib province.  The suicide car bomb attack was reportedly carried out by a man who enticed children waiting near the buses at a checkpoint to come closer to his vehicle by handing out crisps and sweets, several rebel and regime media sources said.  The bombing - which killed 126 people, among them 80 children - has not been claimed. While both sides have blamed the other for the attack, it is likely to have been carried out by extremist factions of Jaish al-Fatah, a rebel umbrella group with al Qaeda links, which was reportedly unhappy that the regime was allegedly bussing out more fighters than agreed.  By midweek the full evacuation programme appeared to have restarted, both rebel and state media said, with 3,000 residents of the pro-government villages Foua and Kefraya leaving on 45 buses.  Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people, including opposition fighters, left Madaya and Zabadani, near Damascus, heading toward northern rebel-held Idlib province.  The multiple-stage transfer deal, which could see 30,000 in total moved across front lines, has been widely criticised as not meeting base-level safety standards. The UN has said the swaps of mostly Shia and Sunni populations amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. Syria's civil war is now in its seventh year. The complex conflict has left 500,000 people dead. \n",

            "Paragraph: Donald Trump is misleading people by citing unscientific, unrepresentative Internet polls that portray him as the \"winner\" of Monday's debate. \"We won every poll. Virtually every poll,\" he told supporters Tuesday afternoon, challenging the media consensus that Hillary Clinton prevailed. Trump also promoted eleven of these so-called polls in a tweet, calling his wins in them \"such a great honor.\" But the things Trump called \"debate polls\" -- implying rigorous, scientific polling -- were informal web site surveys that invited anyone to respond. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNNMoney that the surveys are like \"junk food.\" Meaningful national polls seek a diverse sample of respondents. The goal is to accurately represent the views of the country by accounting for differences in age, gender, party affiliations and other factors. That's not possible when anonymous web users fill out online surveys. People choose whether to participate, and they can vote multiple times, further warping the results. The only thing these surveys can measure, to a limited degree, is enthusiasm -- and some Trump supporters are definitely enthusiastic. But political scientists and researchers say it is a mistake to read much more than that into unscientific survey results. Early Tuesday morning, former Obama strategist David Plouffe tweeted that the online surveys cited by Trump are simply \"bogus.\" Trump's proclivity for unscientific surveys was on display throughout the primary season. He frequently claimed that he \"won\" debates based on self-selecting polls conducted by web sites like The Drudge Report. Several respected news outlets -- Time, CNBC and Fortune to name three -- posted the surveys after Monday's debate, lending the unreliable practice an air of credibility. While sites like Time may value giving visitors a way to opine about the debate, Trump's embrace of the results ends up embarrassing both himself and the news outlet involved. \"These snap polls are just a way to feed the beast until the next batch of appropriately-conducted polls can come out to tell us if voters actually moved. It's like eating a junk food snack between meals,\" Anderson said. Trump's tweet also cited surveys from obscure web sites like \"PolitOpinion.\" In one case on Tuesday, Trump even cited a poll that did not exist. \"I won CBS,\" he said on \"Fox & Friends.\" CBS correspondent Major Garrett took to Twitter to clarify: \"We did not conduct a post-debate poll.\" CBS did conduct a focus group of undecided voters, and Clinton came out ahead. Trump said on Fox that the survey results \"mean a lot\" to him, noting that hundreds of thousands of votes were cast on some of the web sites. That's true, but since people can vote multiple times -- and, with the right software, perhaps even more than that -- it isn't necessarily meaningful. Nevertheless, the surveys allow Trump and his aides to rail against media elite reactions to the debate and argue that voters are outsmarting pundits. And that's exactly what the campaign did on Tuesday. \"Trump won\" was the campaign's dominant social media message, citing the surveys as proof. Some political reporters called out the tactic. ‏\"Trump's aggressive promotion of online (easily manipulated, non-scientific) polls saying he 'won' is a calculated effort to create a reality,\" Emily Flitter, who covers the Trump campaign for Reuters, tweeted. But the co-hosts of \"Fox & Friends,\" who are reliable cheerleaders for Trump, went along with Trump's talking point. Other Fox hosts also picked up on it, even though the network has its own well-regarded polling unit. Fox morning news anchor Martha MacCallum said debate watchers are \"leaning toward Donald Trump, and by pretty large margins in most of these viewer polls.\" She called CNN's poll the \"outlier,\" showing Clinton as the clear winner among debate watchers. In fact, CNN/ORC's poll was one of the few polls conducted by professional researchers immediately following the debate. \"Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Trump had the better night,\" CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote, based on the findings of interviews with 521 registered voters. \"Although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as Democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed Clinton the winner.\" Conflating CNN's scientific poll with unscientific surveys, as both Trump and MacCallum did, is highly misleading. Some web sites, hungry for traffic, glommed on to the Trump-invented controversy. \"Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN's overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey,\" The Daily Mail web site said. Unhappy with the results of CNN's scientific poll, Trump criticized the network on Twitter, on Fox and at a campaign event. \"We won virtually every poll. Except for CNN. And nobody watches CNN,\" he said. About 10 million people watched the debate on CNN on Monday night. Overall, more than 80 million people tuned in on television, and millions more live-streamed the debate on the Internet.\n",

            "Paragraph: One of the hottest tech stocks of the past year and a half is helping to make driverless cars a reality. Nvidia (NVDA, Tech30), a company most well known for graphics processing chips used for video games, has also developed the Drive PX autonomous car computer and Drive CX digital cockpit. Nvidia's technology also powers in-car navigation and entertainment systems. Honda (HMC), Daimler's Mercedes Benz, Volvo and Tesla (TSLA) are some of Nvidia's bigger automotive partners. Autos are still a small business for Nvidia, but it is growing rapidly. Sales from its car customers surged 75% last year. And the company said in its latest annual report that its automotive technology, which is currently in more than 10 million cars, offers processing power greater than 150 Macbook Pro notebooks. Investors are getting behind the wheel too. Nvidia's stock surged nearly 65% in 2015 and is up another 34% so far this year. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang has been a bit of an evangelist for autonomous cars. He's appeared at tech conferences with Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss them -- and proudly tweeted about his new Model X last year. Love my new rocket! Congrats, Elon and the @TeslaMotors and NVIDIA teams. - Jen-Hsun Huang pic.twitter.com/KXdkuSMr3j — NVIDIA (@nvidia) October 27, 2015 Nvidia will face tough competition in the market though -- most notably from chip company Mobileye (MBLY). Semiconductor giants Intel (INTC, Tech30), Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are also dipping their toes in the autonomous car waters. Earlier this year, Intel bought an Italian company called Yogitech, which is working on making driverless cars safer. But the good news for Nvidia is that even as it looks to become a bigger player in autonomous cars, its core business is still doing quite well. Revenue from its gaming chips unit surged more than 35% last year. That division accounts for 56% of Nvidia's total sales. And that appears to be the main reason why Nvidia is thriving while Mobileye, which is more of a pure play on driveless tech, has been struggling lately. GM (GM), Nissan (NSANF), BMW and Hyundai (HYMTF) are four of Mobileye's biggest customers. Shares of Mobileye are down 13% this year and 23% over the past 12 months, in part due to fears of increased competition. Still, the self-driving market may be big enough for more than one player, especially since auto companies aren't the only ones building autonomous cars. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) is developing self-driving vehicles and rumors are running rampant that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) also has a car in the works. So there may be enough wealth to spread around for Mobileye, Nvidia and other developers of what will wind up being the guts of self-driving cars.\n",

            "Paragraph: Um, so, Oxford University is older than the Aztecs. THE AZTECS. 1. Cleopatra lived closer in time to the invention of Snapchat than to the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Cleopatra died a little more than 2,000 years ago in 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed around 2560 BCE. That’s a difference of more than 2,500 years. 2. Also, the Great Pyramid was older to the Romans than the Romans are to us. Even in its earlier years, the Roman Empire was still further removed from the construction of the Great Pyramid than they are from us. 3. Oh, and the Stegosaurus was older to the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T. rex is to us. Not only did they not exist at the same time, but the T. rex (which lived 85 to 65 million years ago) became a species about 74 million years after the Stegosaurus died out. 4. The oldest living person was born closer to the signing of the US Constitution than to today. Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, the oldest living person today at age 117, was born in 1899. That’s 112 years after the signing of the Constitution, which was signed in 1787. 5. The 10th president of the United States has two grandchildren who are alive today. John Tyler had a son, Lyon Tyler, at age 63. Lyon went on to have children late in life as well, including Lyon Tyler Jr. and Harrison Tyler, both of whom are alive today...and are only in their eighties. 6. Oxford University is older than the Aztec civilization. Oxford began teaching in some form all the way back in the year 1096. By most accounts, the Aztecs didn’t begin their civilization until the beginning of the 13th century. 7. Harvard University was founded before Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity. While not nearly as old as Oxford, Harvard is still an old university. It was founded in 1636, almost 50 years before Isaac Newton published his Principia Mathematica in 1687, which outlined his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. 8. We made it to the moon only 66 years after the Wright brothers invented human flight. The Wright brothers’ first flight was in 1903, and the Apollo 11 moon landing was in 1969. There’s so much Americans can accomplish when we get in a pissing contest with Russia. 9. Woolly mammoths were still alive when the Great Pyramid at Giza was built. In fact, the pyramid was roughly 1,000 years old when the mammoths went extinct completely, which wasn’t until about 1560 BCE. 10. When the first Star Wars movie came out, France was still executing people by guillotine. The final execution by guillotine in France occurred in 1977, when a man by the name of Hamida Djandoubi was executed for torturing and killing his girlfriend. That was the same year the first Star Wars movie hit theaters. 11. When the fax machine was invented, people were still traveling the Oregon Trail. The first major wagon train hit the Oregon Trail in 1841. Just two years later, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain created a preliminary version of the modern fax machine. 12. The Ottoman Empire still existed when Paramount Studios was founded. The Ottoman Empire was founded around the year 1300, but it lasted all the way until 1922. Paramount was founded 10 years earlier in 1912. 13. Betty White is older than sliced bread. Speaking of 1922, that’s the year Betty White was born. By contrast, the first commercially produced, automatically sliced loaves of bread weren’t made until 1928. 14. Will Smith is now older than James Avery (Uncle Phil) was when Fresh Prince of Bel-Air started. Not sure how it’s even possible, but Will Smith is now 48 years old. James Avery was 45 when Fresh Prince premiered back in 1990. 15. If they made a That ’90s Show and waited the same amount of time after the decade as That ’70s Show waited after the ’70s, the show would be made in 2017. It might seem like That ’70s Show was made way after the end of the ’70s, but that gap is exactly the same as the gap between now and the ’90s. 16. The Eiffel Tower was inaugurated the same year Nintendo was founded. Most people know that the Eiffel Tower was inaugurated for the 1889 World’s Fair. What you might not know is that Nintendo started out as a playing card company, and was founded in the same year. 17. Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., and Barbara Walters were all born in the same year. Though they’re often thought of as having lived in very different times, Anne Frank, Barbara Walters, and MLK Jr. were all born in 1929. 18. Some of the world’s whales that are alive today were born before Moby-Dick was written. Some bowhead whales are believed to have a lifespan of more than 200 years. Since Moby Dick was published in 1851, that means there may be whales out there who are nearly 50 years older than the book. 19. Pluto didn’t even get to complete one orbit around the sun between the time it was discovered and the time it was declassified as a planet. Pluto was discovered thanks to an observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, back in 1930. It was heartbreakingly demoted in 2006. Because of its distance from the sun, Pluto takes 248 Earth-years to orbit the sun just once. That means it didn’t even get halfway around during the time it was being called a planet. 20. 9/11 happened closer to the fall of the Berlin Wall than to today. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, only 12 years before 9/11, the 15th anniversary of which just passed this year. 21. If the history of the universe were placed on a calendar year, humans would only exist starting around 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31. This was famously outlined by Carl Sagan in Cosmos. If you compressed the entire history of everything, going back to the Big Bang, into a calendar year, all of human history would only take up just a little more than the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year. 22. More than 6% of all humans who have ever lived are alive today. Thanks to a boom in population growth following advances in technology and medicine, the current human population living on Earth right now is about 6% of the entire human population in the entire history of the planet. 23. Everything you see happened in the past, not the present. Since it takes about 50 milliseconds for visual information to process in your brain, by the time you actually \"see\" something, it happened in the past.\n",

            "Paragraph: A luxury townhouse on Park Lane is set to become one of the world's most expensive student digs with a rental price of £4,000 a week. The brand new 3,540 sq ft pad is worth £12.5 million and couldn't be further from the average student house with glass floors, a roof terrace and 24-hour concierge. It is built around a dramatic 60ft atrium with a cantilevered glass staircase 'floating' inside, which soars from the lower ground to top floor. Plush carpets run throughout while opulent chandeliers and furniture decorate three lavish bedrooms, reception room and living space. Each of the bedrooms boasts a stylish en-suite bathroom while the master suite comes complete with a walk in dressing room and fitted wardrobes. And the wealthy student will be able to entertain fellow freshers with a 10-seat dining area and designer kitchen, with breakfast bar, gloss units and Miele appliances. In addition, the three-storey house features a roof terrace overlooking Hyde Park and is the only property on Park Lane with a private entrance - a 10ft solid oak door. It even has air conditioning, underfloor heating and a 24-hour concierge service, as well as state-of-the-art home entertainment and security systems. Set in London's exclusive Mayfair, the newly-converted house is available to let for£4,000 a week or £192,000 a year - SEVEN TIMES the average annual UK salary. It is likely to be called home by a mega-rich teenager from a Middle Eastern royal family - from Saudi Arabia, Qatar or United Arab Emirates. Eighty per cent of enquiries received by agent Wetherell since it was first advertised a week ago have been from middle eastern 16 to 21-year-olds. Peter Wetherell, Chief Executive of Wetherell, described number 80 Park Lane as the \"ultimate address\". He said: \"Park Lane is London's most famous and prestigious address, an iconic location made famous by its enduring blue-chip status on the board game Monopoly. \"This luxurious triplex has the distinction of being the only townhouse with its own private front door on Park Lane, all the other homes on Park Lane being apartments. \"This property will appeal to an ultra-high-net-worth person or family, probably from the Middle East or Asia, who wants to launch themselves into Mayfair society.\" Park Lane is one of the most sought-after streets in Westminster, London, and is arguably the city's most famous address. The 0.7 mile road, which was created by King Henry VIII, runs from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch and overlooks the 350 acres of Hyde Park. The first houses were built along Park Lane in the 1720s and it became the address of choice for aristocracy. In later years, it became popular with new-money industrial and financial tycoons and is now home to luxury apartment buildings and five-star hotels. The flash new student house is the only townhouse on Park Lane - all the other homes are apartments, and one mansion-palace owned by an overseas royal family. Fred Astaire, Somerset Maugham, Cecil Day Lewis, Elizabeth Taylor, Mohammed Al Fayed, the Sultan of Brunei and the Emir of Qatar have all lived on the road.\n",

            "Topic: Quiche Is Not an Egg Dish. It Is a Butterfat Dish.\n",
            "Paragraph: For most of my life, I’ve thought of quiche as frittata with crust—which is to say savory egg pie. Since frittata is incredibly easy and delicious, and pie crust is not an exciting pastry, I’ve generally made lots and lots of frittatas and not very many quiches. But a few months ago, I discovered how very wrong I was about quiche when Slate’s chairman brought me a square of caramelized-onion quiche from his new favorite bakery, Arcade Bakery in Tribeca. It tasted nothing like a frittata: Instead of being eggy and sturdy, the filling was moist and creamy to the point of silkiness. It was simultaneously light—the filling practically dissolved on my tongue—and rich, like a triple-crème brie or an over-the-top chocolate mousse. As I luxuriated in each bite at my desk in the middle of Slate’s open-plan office, I resented that my surroundings were unworthy of this gastronomic experience—this was a quiche worthy of a picnic in Provence, or at least an intimate dinner party. Eager to learn the key to this delicacy, I reached out to Roger Gural, the owner of Arcade Bakery, to ask for his recipe, which he kindly shared. His approach is unusual in some ways—for instance, he adds yeast to his pie dough, which gives it a breadier exterior and a more interesting flavor than traditional pâte brisée. But the secret to Gural’s amazing quiche isn’t really a secret at all: It turns out quiche isn’t primarily an egg dish; it’s primarily a cream and milk dish. Quiche filling should contain just enough eggs to prevent it from being soupy, but the eggs are (literally) a supporting player. It’s the butterfat in the cream and milk that is responsible for a good quiche’s disarmingly rich texture. In other words: Quiche isn’t frittata with crust; it’s savory custard with crust. (This is why it needs a crust—without it, the custard would fall apart and look gross when you tried to serve it.) The recipe below is lightly adapted from Gural’s; some proportions changed ever so slightly in the transition from metric to conventional American measurements, and I used a standard round pie plate instead of Arcade Bakery’s rectangular mold. I also streamlined the crust, but if you don’t have the time to wait for a yeasted dough to rise, you can substitute a standard pie crust. You can also skip the caramelized onions to save time, or substitute other fillings, as long as they’re fairly dry—excess liquid will ruin the filling’s texture, which is, after all, the most important part. Caramelized Onion Quiche Adapted from Arcade Bakery Yield: 6 to 8 servings Time: 21⁄2 to 41⁄2 hours, largely unattended 6 tablespoons (3⁄4 stick) cold unsalted butter 2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced Salt and black pepper 11⁄4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the crust 1 tablespoon sugar 1⁄2 teaspoon instant yeast 3 large eggs plus 4 large egg yolks 11⁄4 cups plus 1 tablespoon whole milk 11⁄4 cups heavy cream 1. Put 2 tablespoons (1⁄4 stick) of the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. When the butter melts, add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and dark brown, 1 to 3 hours. 2. Meanwhile, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Stir in 1 of the eggs, 1 tablespoon of the milk, and 2 tablespoons water, and knead with the dough-hook attachment of a stand mixer or by hand until the dough feels smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Cut the remaining 1⁄4 cup (1⁄2 stick) of the butter into 1⁄2-inch pieces, add it to the dough, and continue to knead until the butter is fully incorporated. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, put it in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 1 hour. (At this point you can wrap the dough in foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.) 3. Heat the oven to 350°F. Put the remaining 2 eggs and 4 egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the remaining 11⁄4 cups milk, the cream, 3⁄4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Whisk to combine.\n",

            "Paragraph: May 29 - The Minneapolis parks system scored highest in the nation for the second straight year in a report ranking U.S. urban greenspace that was released on Thursday. The Midwestern city topped the Trust for Public Land's third \"ParkScore\" survey, which ranks the quality of parks in the 60 largest U.S. cities. The trust looked at how many residents could reach a park quickly by foot, median park size, the percentage of total city area dedicated to parks, per capita spending, and the number of playgrounds available per 10,000 city residents. \"This year's ParkScore results show that even outstanding park systems must improve to stay on top,\" Peter Harnik, director of the Trust for Public Land's Center for City Park Excellence, said in a statement. \"When population grows, more parks and playgrounds are needed, but when city leaders get creative, they can meet the increased demand.\" Minneapolis received high marks for its parks system partly because some 94 percent of its residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park. While second-ranking New York registered 97 percent of its residents within a 10-minute walk of a park, its low median park size - 1.1 acres compared with Minneapolis' 7.1-acres - took points from its score. In this year's survey, Boston, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, tied for third place. Sacramento dropped from the top three, the trust said, because population growth limited access to playgrounds. On the upswing, Denver climbed 10 places this year to land in the 7th slot with Sacramento. Overall, West Coast cities dominated the top 10 local park systems, while southern and southwestern cities such as Louisville, Charlotte and Mesa, Arizona, were among the five cities with the lowest-ranking park systems, the trust said. Fresno, California, was rated as having the worst park system, unchanged from last two year's ranking.\n",

            "Paragraph: This weekend as many as 2,500 residents of Mosul escaped from the western half of a city that has been under the yoke of so-called Islamic State (IS) for almost three years. Aid agencies estimate that there are approximately 750,000 civilians trapped in western Mosul, unable or too frightened to leave despite the very real prospect of a prolonged, intense battle over the city between Iraqi government forces and IS fighters. The assault on western Mosul has, thus far, been largely as expected - a much better equipped and better trained Iraqi army than the one humiliated by IS in 2014, methodically pushing towards the edge of the city thanks to overwhelming fire power and the cover of coalition air strikes. For all their brutality and intolerance, IS fighters are nothing if not ingenious and in recent days they have been deploying a battle tactic almost unprecedented in modern urban warfare - the use of commercially available drones to drop bombs and grenades against civilian and military targets. Large military drones are, of course, used to devastating effect by armies all over the Middle East, often resulting in huge loss of life. But the frequency and accuracy of how the Islamic State group is utilising small, relatively unsophisticated drones in Mosul has significantly slowed the advance of government forces. The drones have also caused panic among the civilian population, including residents of eastern Mosul. That part of the city was recaptured from IS last month during the first part of a campaign to drive the Islamists from their last stronghold in Iraq. At a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil I met 55-year-old Umm Mohammed. The mother of seven, from the eastern side of Mosul, was sitting up in her bed, attached to a drip and unable to rest because of the searing pain from her right leg. It had been shattered in several places by a grenade or small bomb dropped from a drone. \"I'd just gone to the market for some shopping... The next thing I was lying on the ground and looking up. People started pointing up to the sky from where the bomb had come,\" she told me. \"Where's the security when these machines are hovering over people and killing us?\" Psychological effects The use of drones, with their relatively light payloads, will not change the course of this conflict. There are much more expensive, lethal and sophisticated weapons being deployed each day in their thousands. Yet the psychological impact of drone attacks cannot be discounted, says Emanuele Nannini from the Italian aid agency Emergency, which helps run the hospital where Umm Mohammed and several other drone victims are being treated. \"Physically they are very similar to a mortar attack but actually they are very precise,\" Mr Nannini tells me, as he supervises a rapid expansion of the hospital beds and wards in anticipation of the battle unfolding in western Mosul. \"So each of these drones is actually striking the target that was chosen. Psychologically it can be very bad for the population because they can strike at any moment and at any place.\" The residents of eastern Mosul are, ironically, getting a brief respite from the drone attacks because IS militants have diverted their attention to the new front line to the south and west of the city. A colleague who returned from reporting duties at the front over the weekend told me in graphic terms that it was \"almost raining bombs\" - such was the frequency and intensity of the drone attacks on forces trying to enter the city. Again, it's important to emphasise the overwhelming military and numerical advantage that Iraqi military units have over their IS enemies. They are also getting considerable help from their American and other coalition allies. \"The fight in Mosul would be a huge challenge for any army, but this battle is only going to end with one result,\" says Lieutenant Colonel John Hawbaker, commander of the 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry. American \"advisers\" and troops are a common sight on and just behind the front line and at forward command bases, assisting and advising their Iraqi counterparts. But, as Lt Col Hawbaker readily acknowledges, American soldiers - so-called \"boots on the ground\" - are seeing action where it is deemed appropriate. At the base I visited a few kilometres back from the western edge of Mosul, huge American artillery pieces fired shells at IS positions in and around the besieged city. Territorial control: 24 February 2016 The day before, the gunners told me, they'd had the busiest period yet in this conflict, lobbing hundreds of shells at distinctive targets picked out by their own spotters and much more sophisticated \"eyes in the sky\", or surveillance drones. The state of the art US weaponry will be of less use as the battle moves into the narrow, winding streets of Mosul itself. On the first day of real fighting inside the western zone, government troops reported encountering \"dozens\" of booby-trapped car bombs. Some of them were successfully defused but others exploded, killing and wounded several Iraqi soldiers. It's also thought that, in another example of drones adapted for urban warfare, IS militants are using the small aircraft to guide suicide car bombers to their targets. Amid the chaos and mayhem, Mosul's civilian residents are being exposed to unimaginable daily horrors. American and Iraqi generals say the fighting will be \"house-to-house\" in buildings where IS militants have deliberately placed themselves among the civilian population and in which they have constructed an elaborate network of tunnels to move themselves and their weapons. Outside the city, aid workers wait nervously. The UN refugee agency is building new camps, just to the south, preparing to receive as many as 250,000 internally displaced people. The real concern, as one UN aid official told me, is that most of the population won't able to escape, that they'll be trapped inside Mosul until the fighting finishes, the guns fall silent and Islamic State is defeated.\n",

            "Paragraph: As 2016 comes to a close, some people are thinking about their careers and the moves they're planning to make in the coming year. Those looking to find a new job  and maybe contemplating uprooting themselves to do it  should do some research on which cities offer the best opportunities for work. To get a sense of which large cities give job seekers the best chance of finding employment, we looked to data from Indeed.com, a large job search platform that operates throughout the U.S. and internationally. The company provided us numbers on which cities in the U.S. have the most job openings per capita. We folded Indeed's numbers into an easy-to-read slideshow of the top 10 easiest cities for finding a job, which you will find below. Indeed.com pulls this jobs-per-capita data at various points throughout the year so we looked at which cities made jumps over last quarter, as the most recent data we are using for our list emerged in October. Richmond, Virginia, comes in sixth place in this latest data set, having jumped up from ninth place last quarter. Nashville, which placed eighth by the latest numbers, had previously placed sixth, showing a small drop. The top three cities with the most open jobs per capita are static from last quarter. In third place we see Denver, Colorado, which shows 57 job openings per 1,000 residents in that metropolitan region. In second place we see Salt lake City, Utah, with 65 jobs per 1,000 people living there, and in first place is San Jose, California  in the heart of Silicon Valley  with 67 jobs. Good news for those cities, but the other side of the spectrum tells a story of slightly tighter job markets. Indeed.com researched the 50 most populous metropolitan regions in the country, and the bottom ten  cities with the lowest number of job openings per 1,000 residents  was also made available for our coverage. For a full ranking of those, we printed the list below. 1. San Jose, CA Job Postings Per 1,000 Residents: 67 2. Salt Lake City, UT Job Postings Per 1,000 Residents: 65 3.

            "Topic: Brexit Is What A Dark Age Feels Like. Here's Why.\n",
            "Paragraph: Brexit Is What A Dark Age Feels Like. Here's Why. Elites in the West are in trouble. Their careful curation of the polity and economy is coming badly unstuck. Their credibility in delivering consumerist goodies is shattering. They have worked so assiduously to eliminate and denigrate all alternative social models that the frustration people now feel has no where to go, no reasoned idiom in which to express itself, so it comes out all over the place. This is what a dark age feels like. The only alternative grand narrative to the liberal market that withstood its celebratory march was nationalism. Especially after 9/11, nationalism of a particularly conservative kind was consistently mobilized by elites in the West in order to create the conditions for an aggressive foreign policy and as a complement to the panglossian idea that unfettered markets created the best of all worlds. Nationalism and neoliberalism were mutually reinforcing up to the point where capitalism continued to deliver the goodies. Once the goose stopped laying those eggs, this dynamic became antagonistic. This is what we are seeing today. There is an old trope in left politics that the working class fail to act and vote in their own interest thanks to the smoke-screen of nationalism. Workers of the postwar world failed to unite across national borders, and instead forged alliances with their own national elites, out of love for nation rather than their fellow workers spread across the world. The reality is more prosaic. These elites, fearing a leftward slide of their own working classes, were convinced to share some of the spoils of capitalism in the interest of maintaining their own hegemony and maintaining the social peace. Workers of the West took the deal, gaining the welfare state and steady employment in return. Nationalism served as a useful framing device for what was, at base, an inter-class alliance, one that survived as long as the economy delivered the goodies. In the course of this arrangement, something called \"economic growth\" became a common-sense, desirable thing. Yet, the obsession with growth on the part of those already rich, something we now appreciate as potentially world-ending, has a straightforward political root. In the absence of unceasing growth, the commitment to deliver more goodies to working people could only be make good through redistribution. If the pie isn't growing, the only way you can give a majority the larger slice you promised is by giving someone else a smaller one. And growth started to hit the rails in the 1970s with oil shocks, labour unrest, and general economic maturity after decades of postwar prosperity. Elites were faced with a stark choice: redistribute, or find another source of growth, quick. The solution they found was given the rosy name of \"globalization.\" Moving the manufacturing sector, which tended to be powerfully unionized, overseas to \"emerging markets\" with authoritarian control over their own working people was the solution. It was the elites of the world who united. Those of East Asia benefited from access to lucrative Western markets and created their own growth miracles, while Western elites were able to discipline their working populations with the threat of outsourcing, even while restarting the growth engine through the delivery of cheaper-made goods and the import of well-behaved immigrants grateful for a chance to work in the West. New technology and a new geopolitics of oil assisted this new global arrangement. This was always a fudge. Western elites were just \"buying time,\" to quote German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck. The myth of a flexible labour force able to be retrained into the burgeoning service sector was just that: a myth. The legacy of postwar industrialism is a working class with no work; once proud industrial cities now turned to rust dot the north of England and the American midwest. The fix worked so long as capitalism delivered the goodies, first with cheaper goods, then with public debt, and most-recently with private debt that was delivered on a scale so far unimaginable thanks to developments in financial engineering and planet-sized pools of saving streaming in from East Asian growth. The Crisis of 2007 brought the latest fix to an end. Without the ability to pump out debt to a majority with chronically stagnant wages, Western elites could no longer deliver the goods to rustbelt populations. So convinced of their stranglehold on the polity, elites badly miscalculated the post-crisis clean-up by having the government bail out the banks - and then paying for the resulting ballooning in the deficit by slashing an already-bare-bones welfare state. They crashed the economy and made working people pay for it. The mask had slipped. The national pact now turned sour. Because the inter-class pact was forged in the language of nation, while other narratives went by the way side, the complaint at its shredding was also voiced in that language. It was not that years of low investment had decimated the welfare state; it was that immigrants were placing undue burdens on it, whatever the facts might say. The irony in the UK is that because of a lack of investment in domestic human capital, the UK has to import most of the labour that runs its National Health Service; the crown jewel of the welfare state is run by immigrants. Without growth, nationalism was the lone pillar on which the post-industrial order in the West could stand. And nationalism came to be the preserve of those left behind. Metropolitan elites, already spatially segregated from the rest of the country by astronomical housing prices in cities, sneer at the rest of the country as simply being another country. London, the south-east of the UK, and the American coasts are indeed plugged in to a different global order, one only nominally attached to the rest of the legacy nation-state. Those cities that successfully made the switch to globalized service industries developed a cosmopolitan, worldy ethic, while the rest were left to resent broken promises of strong national economies. Those left behind by the new settlement still had one last asset left, however - their vote. Their anger had to be managed. In adversarial political systems, their resentment could be exploited by political opportunists. It was precisely the fear that such opportunists would flank the Tories from the right that made David Cameron gamble on the referendum to begin with. The gambit was to meant to give vent to the issue - and then squash it at least for a generation. That it failed, albeit narrowly, is again testament to how elites, cosseted and isolated in their world cities, can make serious errors of judgement. Needles to say, Trump is testing the Republican political establishment in much the same way. Nations are political units but increasingly, they are not economic ones. World cities are connected to developing-nation industrial belts and resource-rich hinterlands in other nations to form a global economic order on its own. Elites from across the world coordinate in ever-deeper ways. Cutting across this global economic order is the vestigial grid of nation states. This contradiction between national polities and global economies will continue to throw up earthquakes like Brexit. The elite-run press wail at the death of reasonable discourse, the failure of experts to convince the public with technocratic arguments, the perfidy of opportunists who weaponize peoples' misery with sheer lies. Yet the simple truth is that reasoned arguments never held the political order together; this was always a liberal myth. The order held together because it delivered the consumerist goodies. And it could only continue to deliver by means of increasingly-fragile fudges. These are now over. People want a new order in which a sense of belonging and a sense of security, nationalism and economics, go together. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this democratic desire. At base, this is what this vote is about. The British people are of course not alone in this search. In searching for a vision in which nations can be economically strong in a connected world, some opportunists will pair up with genuinely racist elements to make political capital. But to see this as merely the resurgence of some archaic, parochial, provincial populism is to miss the wood for the trees. The saddest irony of this vote, however, is that although the underlying impulse is a democratic one, the result will be anything but. Eurocrats will want to punish the UK in order to make an example of it, while British elites themselves will now double down on the slash-and-burn of the welfare state in the name of boosting the economy. Unchecked by the remnants of European social democracy and with the Labour party in shambles, the right-wing of the Tory party will sense that it has the field to itself. The resulting economic pain will of course only further incense those already angry. With the nationalist card now played, the stage is set for old-fashioned class war in one country.

Robert's girlfriend had faced a traumatic death that occurred in her family. Robert tried to support her as much he could, and wanted to cheer her up. As time passed by, the frequency of their sexual intercourse went lower, until their sex life has died completely. Robert, like many others was not ready for this change in relationship, and thought he was to blame as the cause of their lack of sex. Robert thought he wasn't attractive anymore, or doing something wrong. Robert felt his relationship crumbling,\" A lot of people are too willing to throw something away for the chance that something better will come along,\" Robert's story is all too common, as he found out that on the internet, shared the fact that they have a temporary or permanent sex drought in their relationship. It is common to hear that young couples are filled with hormones and youthful feelings, so they have more sex than older couples. Yet many young people suffer from what's nicknamed : \"bed death\" . Dr. Stephen Snyder, a New York City sex therapist was quoted. \"It's very common for me to see couples in their 20s who are distressed over sexless relationships,\" \"Some guys just don't seem to be able to sustain desire in long-term, committed relationships,\" Told us the sex therapist, and continued, \"Some guys have a Madonna/whore thing where once they love a woman deeply, they can't stand the thought of 'debasing' her by thinking of her as a sexual object.\" \"I still want sex and affection.

A year and a half after the storm, they decided to adopt another dog. When they went to a local animal shelter to find a new addition for their family, they got the surprise of a lifetime. The first dog they were introduced to at the Monmouth County SPCA bore a striking resemblance to Reckless. \"Literally when we opened the double doors, the first cage we walk up to I thought 'that looks like Reckless,'\" Chuck James told the Asbury Park Press. \"He was a little heavier and it’s been a little while, but then my wife saw the scar on his head and immediately we start tearing up and we found our dog.\" The dog escaped through a hole in the fence at their Keansburg, N.J., home in October 2012, according to the APP. He had an identification collar on and the family searched for months, but to no avail. Finally, they found him on Thursday, May 1. The animal shelter posted the amazing news on its Facebook page. Reckless, was who was renamed Lucas, was picked up by the SPCA in Monmouth County, according to the New York Daily News. He was not microchipped. \"If Reckless had been microchipped, we could have reunited him with his family much sooner,\" Jerry Rosenthal, president and CEO of the animal shelter, told CNN. \"We love happy endings. I always tell people our goal is to prevent animals from coming into the shelter except when we can get them back to their original owners.\" Reckless made it home just in time for their eldest daughter Ally's 10th birthday.\n",

            "Paragraph: Washington state smokes about twice the amount of marijuana than previously thought, a new study claims. Federal data and survey information compiled by the Rand corporation puts yearly marijuana use in Washington state in the range of 135 metric tons to 225 metric tons during 2013, with 175 metric tons as the median estimate. The Washington Office of Financial Management's assessment put state-wide use at 85 metric tons for 2013, but that estimate was based on federal data from 2008 and 2009. Time reports that the difference in the estimates \"very roughly\" amounts to the difference between about 25 and 50 joints per resident each year. The study was conducted in an effort to help the state's liquor control board prepare for the commercial sale of marijuana, which is scheduled to begin in 2014. \"You need to have a good idea about consumption to make decisions about licensing, how many distributors to allow, how many retail shops,\" Beau Kilmer, the lead researcher on the project said, according to Time. \"It’s important to have this information now, because people will want to know what the world looked like before the stores opened up.\" The median estimate of 175 metric tons of marijuana used amounts to more than 6 million ounces, enough for around 340 million joints, according to the Associated Press. Washington state legalized marijuana in December of 2012. On Dec. 6 of this year, crowds gathered under the Space Needle in Seattle to commemorate the anniversary of legalization with a city-sanctioned pot party, KOMO News reported. \"If we were all in Texas, we'd be arrested and charged with felonies,\" resident Jay Zozh said as the crowd passed around a footlong joint, according to the station.\n",

            "Topic: I asked 5 fascism experts whether Donald Trump is a fascist. Here's w...\n",
            "Paragraph: Is Donald Trump a fascist? common It's becoming a question , and prominent neoconservative columnist Robert Kagan is the latest to lob the accusation, declaring, \"This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac 'tapping into' popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party — out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear — falling into line behind him.\" Kagan is wrong. Donald Trump is not a fascist. \"Fascism\" has been an all-purpose insult for many years now, but it has a real definition, and according to scholars of historical fascism, Trump doesn't qualify. Rather, he's a right-wing populist, or perhaps an \"apartheid liberal\" in the words of Roger Griffin, author of The Nature of Fascism . He doesn't want to overthrow the existing democratic system. He doesn't want to scrap the Constitution. He doesn't romanticize violence itself as a vital cleansing agent of society. He's simply a racist who wants to keep the current system but deny its benefits to groups he's interested in oppressing. Griffin, who is a professor of history and political theory at Oxford Brookes University, puts it best: \"You can be a total xenophobic racist male chauvinist bastard and still not be a fascist.\" Fascism requires the rejection of democracy Defining fascism is a notoriously difficult scholarly task. There are enough differences between the relevant fascist regimes — Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy, perhaps Francoist Spain — that identifying commonalities that do not in turn implicate plenty of clearly non-fascist regimes is tricky. But there is general agreement about some requirements. Every expert I spoke to identified support for the revolutionary overthrow — ideally through violence — of the state's entire system of government as a necessary characteristic of fascism. Griffin's preferred definition of fascism is: Fascism is a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultra-nationalism. The word \"palingenetic\" means rebirth, reflecting Griffin's view that fascism must involve calling for the \"rebirth\" of the nation. That might at first glance sound like Trump's promise to \"make America great again,\" but Griffin insists on a distinction. Rebirth, in his theory, actually requires the dramatic abandonment of the existing political order. \"There has to be a longing for a new order, a new nation, not just a reformed old nation,\" he told me. \"As long as Trump does not advocate the abolition of America's democratic institutions, and their replacement by some sort of post-liberal new order, he's not technically a fascist.\" Matthew Feldman, a fascism expert at Teesside University in the UK, agrees. \"He's still in the democratic family,\" he says. \"Trump is calling for ethnocratic small-l liberalism. It's liberalism that's racially tinged. If you were white in apartheid South Africa, you had all the rights and benefits of a liberal state. For you it was a democracy. But it didn't feel that way for blacks in South Africa.\" Columbia's Robert Paxton lays out a slightly different definition from Griffin's in his book The Anatomy of Fascism , focusing more on the behaviors of fascist governments than on the nature of fascism as a doctrine. Still, he too identifies an anti-democratic core to fascism: Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion. (p. 218) \"Democratic liberties\" here means not just individual civil liberties — which Trump is clearly interested in tampering with — but the democratic process itself. When the original fascist regimes emerged, \"the existing governments seemed to be incapable of providing leadership, providing what was needed for this wounded country,\" Paxton tells me, \"and so fascists were in favor of totally overthrowing the existing constitution, which was usually democratic and perceived as weak. This was wildly popular. We are not in that position today.\" Trump definitely attacks the current government as \"weak,\" which Paxton says might be termed a \"borrowing\" from fascism. But it's a far cry from the outright support for ending democracy that characterizes true fascists. The University of Wisconsin's Stanley Payne, author of Fascism: Comparison and Definition and A History of Fascism, 1914–1945 , emphasizes that fascism is a \"revolutionary nationalist project. Not just a nationalist project, but a nationalist project that is revolutionary and breaks down all the standards and the barriers.\" Trump and other far-right populists don't count. \"It's what you'd call a right-wing populist movement,\" he says of the Trump campaign. \"They take conservative positions that were very common, say, 75 years ago or 100 years ago, and not at all common now. ... You can call them more genuinely reactionary in their discourse. They go back to older kinds of political and social values that have been discarded. That would be a more accurate characterization than calling them fascist.\" Fascism emphasizes violence for its own sake Payne also notes that Trump lacks a connection to the pro-violence philosophy at the heart of fascism. This dates back to Georges Sorel, a French syndicalist philosopher who was revered by Mussolini and the Italian fascists. Sorel praised violence as a necessary tool of the class struggle. \"Proletarian violence ... appears thus as a very fine and heroic thing,\" he writes. \"It is at the service of the immemorial interests of civilization; it is not perhaps the most appropriate method of obtaining immediate material advantages, but it may save the world from barbarism.\" King's College London's Jeremy Jennings, in an introduction to a recent edition of Sorel's Reflections on Violence , writes that Sorel is \"prepared to equate [violence] with life, creativity, and virtue.\" While fascists obviously don't share Sorel's interest in the class struggle, this valorization of violence carried over. Fascism, Payne says, requires \"a philosophical valuing of violence, of Sorelian violence. [Fascists believe] that violence is really good for you, that it's the sort of thing that makes you a vital, alive, dedicated person, that it creates commitment. You make violence not just a political strategy but a philosophical principle. That's unique to fascism.\" Fascists were certainly never shy about using military power to inflict violence. As Mussolini put it in his 1932 essay \"The Doctrine of Fascism,\" \"Fascism ... discards pacifism as a cloak for cowardly supine renunciation in contradistinction to self-sacrifice. War alone keys up all human energies to their maximum tension and sets the seal of nobility on those peoples who have the courage to face it.\" Trump's views on violence simply don't follow in that tradition. \"Trump is inciting prejudice. He really is; words do have consequences,\" Feldman says. \"But that doesn't mean he's a fascist.\" Fascism is anti-individualist — and Donald Trump is an arch-individualist Whatever else can be said about Donald Trump, he is fiercely individualistic. Indeed, a major part of his appeal comes from the fact that he's untethered to any movement or party or even financial interests besides himself. The Republican establishment hates him. He has no affiliated politicians at other levels of government. He runs no party organization or really any political organization with any goal other than promoting himself, personally. And his arguments about how to make America great generally rely on his own skills — his prowess at making deals, his personal strength, etc. This runs in sharp contrast to the fascist tradition, which, while emphasizing cults of personality for leaders, is nonetheless fundamentally concerned with the collective, with the state being redeemed and the fascist political organization being built to redeem it. That aspect is foreign not just to Trump but to 21st century American society in general. \"People are extremely individualistic. No one would dream of putting them in identically colored shirts and putting them in regimented youth movements, action squads,\" Paxton says. \"If someone were proposing that I'd take the parallel more seriously.\" Feldman concurs, arguing that fascism builds a kind of \"political religion\" in which the nation is considered a real, living, and yet sacred thing to be revered and protected. This goes well beyond mere nationalism. \"It's a difference between someone who's patriotic versus someone who sees the nation as a living, breathing organic entity,\" he says. \"Not, 'I want my soccer team to win this match,' but, 'Jews and Muslims are like a festering appendix that must be cut out.' The 300 million Americans are like 300 million cells in the body. The individual is worth nothing. It's one cell in the body.\" Compare that with the ways Trump talks about improving America: \"I will build the finest and most modern veterans hospitals in the world.\" \"I will build the finest and most modern veterans hospitals in the world.\" \"This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America’s tax rate one of the best in the world.\" \"This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America’s tax rate one of the best in the world.\" \"Our highspeed Internet access is only 16th best in the world ... The World Economic Forum ranks the US infrastructure as only the 12th best in the world.\" These statements are much closer to the \"I want my soccer team to win\" version of patriotism — and much more concerned with the qualities of Donald Trump the individual than America the nation. Fascism doesn't really have much to do with economics One might think that the relative comfort Trump displays with state intervention in the economy, relative to his rivals, flirts with fascism, especially when this takes the form of nationalist policies like massive tariffs and immigration restriction. This, fascism experts agree, is an inference too far. \"You have left-wing movements that have been anti-immigration,\" Payne says. \"Fascists did tend to have a nationalist and kind of statist and corporatist economic policy, but all kinds of other movements have had statist and corporatist policies.\" In fact, most experts think that it's hard to identify a characteristically \"fascist\" economic policy. It was all secondary to other goals, notably preparation for war. \"Of all the policy areas, the economic one is the one where classical historic fascist parties were most flexible,\" Paxton says. \"They did what was expedient in the moment. They were defending war veterans and attacking big corporations but quickly dropped that when they discovered they needed the money. ... It's hard to link those people to any one kind of economic idea. They would do anything to make their country militarily ready for war.\" That, incidentally, is a big reason why National Review writer Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism — which tries to tie American progressivism to historical fascism — is something of a running joke among people who actually know stuff about fascism. Paxton Griffin , and Feldman have all published pieces attacking and/or mocking it. Griffin described it to me as \"a really scurrilous work of revisionism, like David Irving, who uses revisionism to deny the Holocaust and rehabilitate Hitler. It's used to attack anyone attempting to introduce a welfare state as a fascist.\" There aren't that many real fascists left There's an argument to be made that we should only use \"fascist\" to refer to a cluster of movements in developed countries in the 1930s and 1940s, and not try to apply it to present-day politics at all, the same way we don't make regular use of the now-defunct \"Chartist\" or \"Carlist\" movements as present-day political terminology. But there are definitely some movements nowadays that draw direct inspiration from '30/'40s fascists, and which fascism scholars are comfortable labeling as fascist. However, they tend to be quite small and fringe, and they all go way, way further than Donald Trump. I found wide agreement among scholars that Golden Dawn , the far-right party in Greece that draws direct inspiration from the Nazis, is fairly described as fascist. \"The emergence of Golden Dawn was interesting to me, because in economic breakdown and the feeling of national humiliation, you get a clear specimen of interwar fascism,\" Griffin says. \"There's a racial purity myth, a rebirth myth, the political ritual, the cryptic symbols. The symbol of Golden Dawn is the Greek symbol of eternity. It's dressed up to look like a swastika. Beautiful. If it didn't exist you'd have to make it up.\" \"Golden Dawn in Greece is openly drawn on the Nazi model,\" Paxton concurs. \"If they think they're fascist, perhaps there's something to be said for calling them fascist.\" But beyond that, the researchers argue for limiting the term to fringe white nationalists and neo-Nazis, who are present in most societies but who outside Greece have little political influence. \"To be a fascist in America, you have to be on a website talking about how the presidential system is controlled by the Zionist Occupied Government,\" Griffin says. Feldman cites the British National Party as a nontrivial force with clear fascist roots, but emphasizes that it's still quite small in real terms. It has no members of parliament. It is widely loathed throughout the UK. Of course, many fringe fascists themselves like Donald Trump and view him as the best they're going to get on a national scale. They argue he's sparking a big spike in activity around and interest in white nationalism. \"Demoralization has been the biggest enemy and Trump is changing all that,\" Stormfront founder Don Black told Politico recently. But that does not make Trump himself a fascist. Far-right populism is much more common, and much more dangerous, than neo-fascism Well, he's a right-wing populist. And while fascists are rare in 2015, right-wing populists are not. In fact, it's kind of weird that America hasn't had a real one before now. The UK has the UK Independence Party (UKIP); France has Marine Le Pen and the Front National; Germany has Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the anti-Muslim Pegida movement; Sweden has the Sweden Democrats; the Netherlands has the Party for Freedom and its leader, Geert Wilders. These parties have a lot in common with Trump . They're fiercely anti-immigration and particularly critical of Islam, couching their bigotry as a reasonable precaution and stoking fear about homegrown terrorism. They draw support away from more establishmentarian, business-friendly right-wing parties. They tend to be led by individual, charismatic figures without whom they'd be substantially weakened. They tend to be more sympathetic to welfare programs and the safety net than traditional conservatives, much as Trump has vocally defended Social Security against more traditional candidates like Chris Christie who would cut it. \"We're congratulating ourselves to say that anyone who engages in that prejudice is fascist\" But they are not fascists. They still believe in democracy, and they want traditional liberal democratic protections for their white base. \"They're still at bottom democrats rather than fascists,\" Feldman says. \"I think the fitting term is 'illiberal democrats.' They would give full democratic rights for white Christians, or perhaps Jews, but exclude the outgroups of the 21st century: mostly Muslims but also Mexicans. It's really prejudice against them. We're congratulating ourselves to say that anyone who engages in that prejudice is fascist.\" Paxton agrees: \"I don't think it helps very much to use this inflammatory term [fascism] about Trump. 'Populist demagogue' works fine.\" So does Payne: \"The Sweden Democrats and Le Pen movement in France really are just right-wing movements, in the sense of being conservative movements. There's nothing categorically fascist about them. They are outside the general consensus of center-left politics in these countries, and people want to find special pejoratives to apply to them.\" Griffin notes that you don't even have to look to Europe for examples of this brand of right-wing, ethnocentric populism in action. Just look at the long, distinguished history of populist white politicians in America exploiting anti-black prejudice and white ethnic grievances. Those figures weren't fascists; they were small-l liberal democrats who \"wanted liberal democracy to be for a very small group of Americans,\" in Griffin's words. Again, fascism requires stepping outside the system and attacking the democratic structure. As long as that structure itself is handling illiberal attitudes on race, those attitudes don't themselves constitute a fascist trend. But the views are still illiberal. To be very, very clear: Donald Trump is a bigot. He is a racist. He is an Islamophobe and a xenophobe. He profits off the hatred and stigmatization of traditionally oppressed groups in American society. That makes him, and his European peers, and racists in other eras in American history, a threat to crucial values of equality and fair treatment, and a threat to the actual human beings he's targeting and demonizing. And he's in particular mainstreaming Islamophobia, which is on the rise in recent months, as seen in a recent incident in which a Muslim engineer was harassed at a Fredericksburg, Virginia, civic meeting . \"I’m really not sure those views in Fredricksburg would be aired were it not for Trump’s ‘mainstreaming’ of these prejudices,\" Feldman says. Kevin Passmore, a historian at the University of Cardiff and author of Fascism: a Very Short Introduction , puts it well: \"For me, the point about Trump’s proposals is not whether or not they are ‘fascist,' but whether or not they are moral.\" And they very clearly are not.\n",

            "Paragraph: < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 5 NEXT SLIDE > © Provided by Mirror The idea that families come in all shapes and sizes has never been more true with adoption, same-sex relationships and the introduction of new ways to conceive. Writer Samuel Leighton-Dore, 25, spoke to Mirror Online about his decision for his sister to have his child - and has opened up about the negative response it has received. Samuel, from Sydney, is in a relationship with photographer and designer Bradley Tennant but doesn't want to miss out on their baby having both of their family's genes. As a compromise, his sister Bronte has agreed to donate her eggs so that the couple can have the family they've always wanted. Samuel told Mirror Online: \"It's not too strange when you break it down. We'll be using IVF. It'll be my sister's egg and my partner's sperm with a third-party surrogate, preferably someone who already has a family of their own. \"It's the only way my partner and I can both have a biological connection to our future children. \"It might sound vain to some people, but I think the desire to have a child with the person you love is pretty intrinsic and natural.\" The couple aren't entering into the decision lightly. Samuel says a baby is still \"a few years away\" as the process is all very expensive, but he stresses that \"it's definitely something you have to think about and plan ahead of time.\" Samuel has been floating the idea with Bronte on and off for a while, but says they started speaking more seriously about it as they got older. He said: \"I think she's excited about it. We've always been close so I think it means a lot to her that she's in a position to help Brad and I start a family one day.\" Bronte won't be known as the child's mother but Sam thinks he and Bradley will call her a 'special auntie' or 'fairy godmother'. \"It's always important for a child to have a strong female presence in their life, so I'm sure she can be that person in a way that doesn't cross the line into parenting.\" The couple have a great support system behind them and have had a wonderfully positive response from their immediate family. \"My parents are both pretty open-minded, so the discussion hasn't been as complicated as some might expect. We're lucky. I'm not sure what my extended family will think, but I'm sure they'll understand the science, logic and love behind the process.\" Unfortunately, narrow-minded social media users haven't been so understanding - but Samuel takes these with a pinch of salt. \"There's always going to be a knee-jerk reaction from those who read headlines but not the full story. I've received a few nasty messages and copped some hate on Instagram, but most of the responses have been really lovely and positive.\" And for all those couples who might consider going down a similar route but are worried about reaction? Samuel has some lovely advice for you. \"I'd say that we're all so incredibly lucky to be living in a time that facilitates so many different ways to make a loving family. If all parties involved are committed and happy, then go for it.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Ignorance is bliss, right? Well sometimes it is. And for a minute we were thinking do we really want to know the ins and outs of sandwich chain Subway – and more specifically the ins and outs of what NOT to order when picking your foot long. But we decided it's probably for the best that we do. The desk lunch is taking over the nation, and it’s keeping you from this—the actual nation! Fight back and #SaveLunchBreak! A photo posted by Official Subway (@subway) on Nov 18, 2015 at 12:30pm PST An anonymous subway artist has taken to Reddit to answer all our burning questions about the takeaway joint. The alleged store manager literally said \"ask me anything Subway related\". But he/she was sure to emphasise that he/she was not speaking on behalf of his/her employer. One smart Reddit user asked: \"Which items would you recommend? One to avoid and which would you say are highest quality/safest/best prepared?' Most Popular Anonymous Subway Worker responded by saying that people should avoid the 'stinky chicken'. Sounds like something from Urban Dictionary... \"Avoid: Chipotle Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken. Why? Chicken is given a two-day shelf life, once in the counter. However, these two [sandwiches] bypass this and get four days, and can get a little stinky. Feast your eyes on the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki sandwich, made with all white meat. Did we say feast? #ChefFresh A photo posted by Official Subway (@subway) on Jul 1, 2016 at 11:45am PDT \"I'd recommend anything else, Subway (at least my Subway) is very strict on quality control and dates. Steak is probably the freshest, and safest.\" Soz, fans of the chicken. Though it's not all bad news: Anonymous Subway Worker reminded us that sandwiches are 20% off between 7pm – 9pm. And he/she gave us a great tip – if you get a 12-inch flatbread sandwich there's a good chance it will in fact be 14 inches long! Not sure why that happens, but we sure like getting more for our money so it's flatbreads all the way from now on. Thinking about it, steak flatbreads would be pretty good. The fleet. With a fully customizable interior, as always. #footlongandfab A photo posted by Official Subway (@subway) on Sep 1, 2015 at 12:02pm PDT A Subway spokesperson responded to Anonymous Subway Worker's claims, saying: \"All Subway stores are independently owned and operated by franchisees. All stores have very strict procedures in place to ensure products are served safely and to customers' satisfaction and all suppliers are required to meet our high standards of food safety and product integrity.\"\n",

            "Topic: You Won’t Believe What Hillary Ordered the DNC to do to Bernie’s Brot...\n",
            "Paragraph: Bernie’s Brother, Larry Sanders, at the DNC You Won’t Believe What Hillary Ordered the DNC to do to Bernie’s Brother! It all went down after the DNC, when Larry Sanders stopped the whole show to cast his vote for his brother, and reports are Hillary was FURIOUS. Or, no... that’s some bullshit. What did you think the payoff for this clickbait headline would be? That Hillary ordered him kicked out of the party? You’ve likely seen a lot of headlines like this in the past year. You may well have clicked on many of them. Today I’d like to talk to you about how bullshit managed to infect this primary, and continues to consume our politics. The art of a headline like this is simple: I took someone beloved (Larry Sanders, who spoke so movingly at the DNC on behalf of his brother) and I combined it with a large dose of schadenfreude — the pleasure we take in other peoples’ suffering. Or in this case, maybe the better word is cynicism: the pleasure we take in believing the worst about people. There are many, many people in the world who want to be told bad things about Hillary Clinton — particularly underhanded nasty things that victimize the progressive left — and that is a desire that’s easy to manipulate. I could have also gone with the headline, \"You Won’t Believe What Trump Ordered the RNC to do to the Khan Family!\" The art of good headline writing and image selection in order to get someone to click and go to a website is usually called \"clickbaiting,\" but I think we should call it \"bullshit curation.\" And this primary, the bullshit curators made a massive cottage industry out of your desire to read nasty things about Hillary Clinton. So much so that people still believe things that are patently untrue. Let’s start with USUncut.com. Why does this website exist? Years ago, it was a tax advocacy group working against austerity measures. But last year, its founders left the organization according to their Linkedin profiles. There’s no \"about\" section on the site. No masthead. No statement of purpose. A critical tenet of journalism is that you have to know who the journalists are — that they are real people whose agenda you can measure. You know who owns Fox News. You know who reports for it. You are able to draw conclusions about their agenda based on what you know about them. Sites like USUncut, however, have unclear ownership and unclear loyalties. And apart from this guy , its bullshit curators don’t seem to have any social media footprint — no Facebook or Twitter presence. Maybe they are real journalists who have managed to avoid having a byline in any publication prior to USUncut. Maybe they are real people who have never made a Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn profile — or who keep those profiles secret. Or maybe they’re freelance writers hired by a click farm to gin up the most salacious headlines possible atop rehashed versions of other peoples’ stories. Under the terms of \"fair use,\" journalism commenting on someone else’s story is protected use of that person’s story, so the game here is simple: A) Real news source breaks story B) Write a story pulling a couple lines from the real news source and commenting on them, generally by slanting them in the direction your readers want to hear C) Add the most outrageous headline you can come up with paired with an image that feeds the interpretation your readers are likely to have of that headline Voila! You’ve taken someone else’s work and made a commentary piece that people are more likely to click on because the headline is sexier than the responsible original piece. By way of example, let’s look at this story: Did that actually happen? Do you know? Don’t google it. Do you know if the DNC committee rejected an amendment to eliminate superdelegates? If you’re like me, you likely saw this headline half a dozen times on friends’ news feeds. Maybe more. You likely have lodged in your head that superdelegates are going to continue as they were this primary, no change, because the evil DNC and Hitlery Klingon blocked any reform or change. But that’s not what happened. Both campaigns worked together and compromised and have formed an ongoing committee to change the rules Could there be any headline less sexy than \"ongoing committee to change the rules is formed\"? But there is no follow up to this headline on USUncut. We got the bullshit, but none of the fact. (UPDATE! I was totally wrong! I SUCK! Here was their follow on piece which I searched for and could not find.) You probably also saw headlines like this: Remember that one? The DNC blocked EVERYTHING Sanders worked for. None of it made it into the platform. NONE. They voted down every last one of his initiatives. Well, wait a minute. Did they? Here’s conservative bastion, The Nation , on how Sanders and his minority on the platform committee achieved multiple major victories in writing the platform. Victories that Sanders then recited in his speech at the DNC. Did they get everything? No. Was it super political? Yes. Did they win on more fronts than they lost? Yes. There’s a lot of nuance there. Terrible for clickbait. And yet, the perception that the DNC threw all of Sanders’ proposals out was so real going into the convention that many of his own supporters thought he wasn’t telling the truth when he said they’d created the most progressive platform in the Democratic Party’s history. There weren’t any follow up stories on sites like US Uncut setting the record straight, except one citing the inclusion of a $15 Minimum Wage (if you’ll recall, multiple sites ran stories about how Clinton’s people had killed the $15 Minimum Wage in the committee as well). Like the Dude, the bullshit abides. Bullshit curation is dangerous. Unless you are constantly reading minute to minute news, and from multiple sources, it is quite easy for these explosive headlines to stick in the consciousness and become truth. Don’t believe me? Look at what has happened to the right wing in this country. They have been in a curated bullshit echo chamber for a decade, and now live in a fundamentally different reality than the rest of us, where crime goes down in the real world, but up in theirs; the Earth gets hotter in the real world, yet never changes in theirs; presidents are born in Hawaii in the real world, but are provably from Kenya in theirs. Why do the curators do it? Well, the answer seems very clear: the better and more cynical the headline and image pairing, the more clicks. The more clicks, the more revenue from the dozens of ads that appear on each page: There is real value to owning a site that can reliably drive hundreds of thousands of people to look at an article. By becoming a well-liked curator of bullshit, you get even more viewership for your bullshit, which means the bullshit has to keep coming — and in more refined form. By the end of the primary, there were many sites delivering the bullshit equivalent of pure-grade heroin. So, why have I told you all this? Because I’d like to challenge you to look at news in a different way. Here are some rules: • Only believe primary sources. If you can hear a candidate saying it, the candidate said it. Don’t believe anyone’s description of what the candidate meant. Judge for yourself. Listen to the words. That means: Only believe primary sources. If you can hear a candidate saying it, the candidate said it. Don’t believe anyone’s description of what the candidate meant. Judge for yourself. Listen to the words. That means: • Don’t believe anything your friends say. Seriously, your friends don’t know anything. Unless they were there personally and heard it themselves, why are you taking their opinion as truth? Don’t believe anything your friends say. Seriously, your friends don’t know anything. Unless they were there personally and heard it themselves, why are you taking their opinion as truth? • Don’t believe stories about a \"guy who heard\" the candidate say something. My friends in the military are awash in stories about terrible things Clinton supposedly said to her security details. None of these stories has ever been confirmed. Similarly, don’t believe the things people heard Trump said once to a guy in a car. Don’t believe stories about a \"guy who heard\" the candidate say something. My friends in the military are awash in stories about terrible things Clinton supposedly said to her security details. None of these stories has ever been confirmed. Similarly, don’t believe the things people heard Trump said once to a guy in a car. • Read well-sourced journalism that relies on primary sources. Read well-sourced journalism that relies on primary sources. • Judge the words and actions of the candidates yourself. Should you judge Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for the things they say? Yes. Should you decide whether you believe them? Yes. Should you read up on policies they enacted and judge them for those policies? Yes. But very importantly: should you judge them based on policies people tell you they actually believe in, but have never said they do nor have ever acted on? No. That is called a conspiracy theory. If you are on the progressive left, you are generally suspicious (I am guessing) of people trying to sell you things. The corporate media is a great example of this — they lie, many of us believe, to keep up viewership and sell ad time. It is, therefore, astonishing to me that the bullshit curators had such a powerful influence on the progressive left this cycle. Why did they write these salacious headlines? Who do they work for? It certainly seems like they’re out to make a quick buck. Why aren’t you more suspicious of anonymous people on the Internet telling you things than you are of Jake Tapper? It’s time to grow a little more suspicious of Internet headlines, folks. Remember, only you can prevent bullshit. UPDATE: Several people have QUITE RIGHTLY called me out for only focusing on USUncut. I find them immensely irritating and so I focused on them. But by no means does that mean they’re the only offender. They’re probably not even the worst offender. You can find many other sites that have used this tactic — and sites that have used knee-jerk defensiveness on Hillary’s behalf to drive clicks. The phenomenon I’m talking about is in no way limited to sites that supported Bernie, and I should have been clearer about that. The right wing has sites doing this, the middle does, the left does. If someone is passionate on a subject, there are sites manipulating that passion to drive clicks. And I know The Nation is not a conservative bastion. It was a joke. Thanks to many folks for recommends and for the feedback — even the harsh kind. Being critical is important! Question everything!\n",

            "Paragraph: Even Americans lucky enough to have paid time off are foregoing valuable vacation days to spend more time at the office, a national Bankrate survey of 1,000 employees shows. Some 52% of Americans say they won't be using all of their paid time off this year. They're often leaving seven days or more on the table, especially in regions like the South and the Midwest. Is America's culture of \"workaholism\" to blame? Partly, the survey shows. The good news is that the top reason workers claimed they did not use all of their vacation days in 2016 was because they were saving them to use in 2017. About a third of respondents said that they plan on taking advantage of the fact that their company lets them roll over unused days. (Though, who knows? They may have said that last year too.) The other reasons given confirm that many U.S. workers feel bound to their jobs. About a quarter of workers say they simply work too much and can't afford to take time off, while just over 15 percent say they actively enjoy working and prefer it to vacation. It's good to remember that more time on the job doesn't necessarily translate to better performance at the job. \"Without taking time to recharge, employees can find themselves stressed, overworked and sick — all of which have a direct impact on their work performance,\" says Sarah Berger, personal finance expert and \"The Cashlorette\" at Bankrate.com. So consider taking your vacation, even if you just recharge at home. But if you can't, and would still like a way to de-stress in your off hours, consider taking up a hobby.

Abrams' \"Star Wars: Episode VII.\" As relayed by Times of London writer Rhys Blakely (via Bleeding Cool), Ejiofor was recently spotted at Abrams' office, which is now enough to start speculation about \"Star Wars.\" For his part, Abrams refused to discuss whether Ejiofor was involved in the \"Episode VII\" casting merry-go-round, but he did tell Blakely that the \"12 Years A Slave\" star was \"a very talented gentleman.\" Ejiofor is just the latest actor to have his or her name attached to \"Episode VII\" discussion, joining the ranks of Benedict Cumberbatch, Saoirse Ronan and Alex Pettyfer. Even original players Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are still only rumored for the sequel, as their involvement has not been confirmed in an official capacity just yet. \"I mean, everybody's going in on this project.

Jordan, who admitted to the Associated Press that he also auditioned for \"Star Wars,\" said back in October. \"Everyone who wants to be part of that film, they know about,\" Cumberbatch told The Hollywood Reporter when the subject of his \"Star Wars\" rumor was broached in a recent interview. For now, Abrams is busy writing the script for \"Episode VII\" with Lawrence Kasdan (Oscar winner Michael Arndt, who was hired to write \"Episode VII\" in November of last year, left the project at the end of October).

If you recall, we told y’all about the Facebook tantrum Sinead O’Connor had a few days ago, when she had made some strong accusations about Arsenio, Prince, and Eddie Murphy. In a nutshell Sinead claimed that Arsenio supplied Prince with the drugs that ultimately killed him and she even went as far as to say that Arsenio spiked her drink back in the day and that Arsenio is Eddie Murphy’s and Prince’s \"bit#h!\" That’s pretty wild, right? Well Arsenio ain’t taking too kindly to Sinead’s Facebook rant, so he did what any sane person would do- he lawyered up and shot back at the \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" singer with a lawsuit that’s large enough to buy everybody in Sinead’s native country of Ireland one small value meal from a fast food joint... ARSENIO DROPS BIG $$$ LAWSUIT ON SINEAD O'CONNOR ARSENIO DROPS BIG $$$ LAWSUIT ON SINEAD O'CONNOR Arsenio just slapped Sinead O'Connor with $5MILLION lawsuit over her Prince rant and claims that Aresenio supplied the legendary Purple One with drugs that ultimately caused his death. I betcha next time she'll think twice before letting her typing fingers take off with a mind of their own on Facebook, LOL. Check out the details on the lawsuit:  via TMZ: 'Arsenio Hall just clapped back at Sinead O'Connor with a $5 MILLION defamation lawsuit over her claim he was fueling Prince's habit. His lawyers, Marty Singer and Lynda Goldman, filed the suit Thursday morning, in which Arsenio calls Sinead a \"desperate attention-seeker\" for posting an incendiary rant on Facebook earlier this week. She called Prince a \"longtime hard drug user\" who got his supply from \"Arsenio Hall (AKA Prince's and Eddie Murphy's bitch).\" In the suit, Arsenio flat out denies ever supplying Prince with illegal drugs -- and adds, he hasn't had contact with Sinead for 25 years. He also denies spiking her with drugs back in the day ... as she claimed. As for why she targeted him -- Arsenio says she's repeatedly said she met Prince a couple times and she \"detested\" him. She also says she told Prince \"to go f*** himself.\" Arsenio implies this is par for the course with Sinead, saying she is \"well known for her media antics and for seeking attention through inflammatory Facebook posts.\"'\n",

            "Paragraph: An elderly woman recently decided to leave her home for a rare outing, but never in her wildest dreams could she have imagine what the day would bring. Maria Vasquez, 93, was accompanied by her caretaker. They stopped at the bank in East Harlem, New York before stopping into a department store so Maria could purchase a pair of comfortable shoes. Maria, who has survived three strokes and lives in public housing, was enjoying her errands, until… Out of nowhere, the security cameras inside Regine’s department store captured a long-haired man coming up behind Maria and reaching straight into her shirt! While Maria sat unaware and bound to her wheelchair, the man proceeded to swiftly grab $600 in social security money out from her bra, where she kept it so it would stay safe. Maria needed that money to pay for food and her monthly bills. By the time Maria realized what had happened, she screamed for help — but the thief had already disappeared out of the store. Word spread fast, and the anonymous robber was quickly dubbed \"the worst person in New York.\" Now, it was up to the police department to find out who did this… Maria Vasquez doesn’t get out much, and when she does, she uses a wheelchair to get around. The 93-year-old woman lives in public housing East Harlem, New York. She is a strong woman who has survived three strokes. Recently, Maria’s health aide accompanied her on some mid-week errands. Their first stop was the bank. Maria noticed a young man looking at her while she cashed her check at the bank, but didn’t think much of it at the time. Maria and her caretaker then stopped at Regine’s a nearby department store. She wanted to pick up a new pair of comfy shoes. But suddenly, that same man who Maria saw glancing at her in the bank walked up behind her. He proceeded to grab the $600 in social security money straight from her bra, scratching her chest in the process. The robbery was swift and seamless, but the whole thing was caught on the store’s security camera. Maria desperately needed that money to pay for rent, electricity and food. The second Maria realized the man had stolen from her, she yelled, \"They’re stealing my money! They’re stealing my money!\" But it was too late — the thief ran out of the store. Maria realized he must have followed her to Regine’s after watching her cash her check. Regine’s released surveillance images of the suspect. Two days later, police tracked him down at his home. The 26-year-old Brooklyn man was charged with two counts of robbery, one count of grand larceny and one count of criminal possession of stolen property. Headlines around the city dubbed him \"the worst person in New York.\" Here’s where the story takes a truly heartwarming turn. While the city of New York lambasted the thief, Maria was flooded with kindness and support. The owner of Regine’s handed Maria $600 in cash to make up for what she lost. He also gave her the shoes she had intended to buy. Felix Roque, the mayor of West New York, New Jersey presented Maria with a check for $1,000 in donations. \"You hear stories about people hurting people,\" he said. \"This is a story about people helping people, and it feels good.\" But the generosity didn’t end there — a stranger set up an online fundraiser that raised $2,000 for Maria — more than triple its goal. Maria says she’s overwhelmed by the show of love and kindness from strangers everywhere. Thankfully, justice has been served. This story proves there are good people in the world.\n",

            "Paragraph: The hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for Earthbound folk. When you sit around imagining life aboard the International Space Station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don’t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel. And you almost certainly don’t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft’s window with it. Especially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of Earth. [NASA reminds us that astronaut poop burns up ‘like shooting stars’] But that’s exactly what happened last month in the space station’s Cupola, a European-built 2010 addition that you’re sure to recognize — it’s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken. \"I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris,\" British astronaut Tim Peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement. \"Yes — this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!\" Um, yeah. You can say that again. NASA released an animation depicting space trash in motion around Earth. (YouTube/NASA) The astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe — they generally don’t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises. And the views are safe, too — the chip is less than a centimeter across. According to the European Space Agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across. A FLAKE OF PAINT. Let that sink in. Because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. Debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. In 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting Earth. The danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film \"Gravity,\" in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk. Space junk is definitely a real concern. Mashable reports that NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of. These days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that’s already there.\n",

            "Paragraph: Disney Having a clean home is one of life’s little joys, right? But by the time Sunday rolls around you’re probably like us and think, \"I HATE CLEANING!\" While there are plenty of excuses you can come up with to NOT clean your home, deep-down you probably know most of those are not very good reasons. Here’s where science can help! Allard Dembe, professor of health services mangement and policy at Ohio State University’s College of Public Health, looked at women from the working generation of the ’70s to ’80s. This was a time when more and more women were having careers, but also still dealing with daily chores back home. Dembe told The Huffington Post, \"My speculation is that women have to play a lot of multiple roles.\" He continued, \"It’s less surprising that women who are then into their 50s and 60s are really bearing the disease repercussions of what’s happened during those early years of really working their butts off.\" 20th Century Fox / abortxretryxfail.tumblr.com Backing up this theory, women who work over 60 hours a week are more likely to have have serious health problems like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer vs. men who work the same hours. Largely because of the underlying assumption that women are doing additional work at home in the form of chores. It’s interesting to see that housework isn’t just annoying, but possibly very damaging to our health, too. And while we now have a pretty good excuse to NOT do housework, we still have to wonder, \"Who will do it FOR US?\" Any volunteers?\n",

            "Paragraph: Cabin fever is creeping in, bringing with it all manner of winter ills, including colds, boredom and lack of productivity. But an ongoing body of research points to one universal cure -- plants. In a study published in August, researchers from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences found that working in an environment with live plants increased employees scores on memory tests, supporting previous findings that vegetation can help us be more productive. University of Michigan psychologists Rachel and Stephen Kaplan explained to Fast Company earlier this week, just how the plant-productivity connection works, by way of a theory they call \"attention restoration.\" In short, attention restoration works much like sleep to help shift our minds from the energy-sapping tasks that require our direct attention to more \"indirect\" or \"effortless\" forms of engagement, as Fast Company explains. And, according to studies, even brief encounters with nature -- such as a glimpse of a plant on a desk -- can have major restorative effects. \"If you have little moments of looking up and seeing something that brings that resource back a little bit, some of those should make a huge difference,\" Kaplan said. The recent findings follow a long line of evidence in the case for bringing nature indoors, including reports that plants can also help you de-stress.\n",

            "Paragraph: And most of them are terrible. Period. 1. The \"Leaky\" Period This period REALLY likes to ruin your favorite pair of underwear. Sure, you may have misjudged the amount of flow comin' on down the pipeline, but that's no excuse for this period to be as wet, squishy, uncomfortable, and just plain rude as it is. 2. The \"Spotty\" Period This period is known for its inability to make a decision. Honestly, its theme song is \"Should I Stay Or Should I Go?\" by The Clash. It's not a full-fledged lava flow, but it would be easier to predict if it was. 3. The \"Chunkster Period\"  This period really wants you to KNOW it's there. It brings all kinds of bodily debris out of your vagina along with it – and it has the consistency of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey. The outcome looks like a murder scene, but somehow it's also oddly satisfying. 4. The \"Phantom\" Period This period is a living, breathing raised middle finger. You've got cramps, are craving anything chocolate, and are maybe a little more emotional than usual, but there are no signs of a bloodbath down there. It's the type of period that you WANT to get over with. 5. The \"Fashionably Late\" Period This period thinks it's a little jokester, but it can be known for sending you spiraling into full panic mode. Like, where the fuck are you? This isn't some kind of fun guessing game. JUST SHOW UP ON TIME. 6. The \"SURPRISE, BITCH!\" Period As the complete opposite of the \"Fashionably Late\" Period, the \"SURPRISE BITCH!\" takes pride in ruining your day by showing up uninvited. Whether it acts on sheer boredom or is just a completely masochist, it literally gives zero fucks about your plans. When it's here, it's HERE. 7. The \"NEVER-ENDING, MY GOD MAKE IT STOP\" Period This period is a conversation that NEVER. FUCKING. ENDS. It's here to tell you all about its mother-in-law, childhood dog, and that one time it went ~off the rails~ at Coachella. Nine days later you look down, thinking it MUST have left, but it's all, \"Oh hey, I'd thought I'd hang a little longer.\" 8. The \"Short and Sweet\" Period This is the kindest period of the bunch whether it knows it or not. Like a polite dinner guest, it shows up on time but doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact, sometimes it decides to peace out early! It's not too wet, too mushy, or too tiresome — it's kinda the best you could ask for. 9. And finally, the \"Kill Me Now\" Period This period thinks your uterus is a goddamn jungle gym. It has absolutely no respect for your pain tolerance, usually leaving you in such agony that you can't BELIEVE you have to deal with this shit every month. Popping a few ibuprofen can dull its fun for a few hours, but it will prevail once it wears off.'\n",

            "Paragraph: While there are multiple ways to answer what causes snoring, let's just take a moment to address it. In some cases, it prevents your partner from sleeping. Even worse, prolonged snoring can lead to excessive tiredness and stress-related health issues. But what causes you to snore? Snoring happens when you can't move air freely through your nose and throat during sleep. This makes the surrounding tissues vibrate, which produces the familiar snoring sound. From an anatomical standpoint, snoring is caused by a partially closed upper airway (the nose and throat).  Everyone’s neck muscles relax during sleep, but sometimes they relax so much that the upper airway partly closes and becomes too narrow for enough air to travel through to the lungs.  Why do some people snore and others don't? Those who have enlarged tonsils, an enlarged tongue or excess weight around the neck are more prone to snoring. The sound itself is an indicator that the person who is snoring has a narrow airway. 40% of normal adults snore regularly, whether they realise it or not. What is snoring doing to your body? Not everyone, but a lot of people who snore also suffer from sleep apnea. Basically, it prevents you from getting the healthy sleep you need to lead a refreshed, energetic life. 3 in 10 men and 2 in 10 women who are habitual snorers suffer from this.  So if you snore and if you are sleeping next to someone who snores, take it as a sign that something is not right. Go see your doctor! \n",

Hell, it was even one of the questions posed by the thought provoking philosophical masterpiece What Women Want. But, thankfully, now a male escort from Australia has stepped forward and put an end to our unquenchable inquisitive thirst once and for all, according to the Daily Mail. Enter Ryan James. A photo posted by Ryan James (@ryanjamessydney) on Mar 7, 2015 at 3:06am PST Ryan is a Sydney based escort who meets women of all ages for sex – charging anything between $400 and $6,000 for his services which can feature just a hotel quickie or a weekend away. But what is it that women really want from Ryan? Well, to be frank, it’s not too fucking hard to guess. What they want is more than just sex, they want companionship and to feel a connection. Ryan said: Pretty much every single client that I see there’s some companionship element to the booking. From what I see, men are more focused on the sexual side of things. Women are focused on the sex too, they wouldn’t come to see me without it, but we spend a lot of time talking as well. Many of the women I see could easily go to a bar and pick a guy up and have sex that way. But they want a difference experience. Sometimes it’s that they’ve been recently divorced, or they’re still married but haven’t been intimate in a long time. I’ve had clients who are couples who want a threesome, and women who are virgins. A photo posted by Ryan James (@ryanjamessydney) on Oct 29, 2014 at 10:34pm PDT But what about when it comes to the sex? What is it that women want, and need, in the bedroom? Well, that’s not too hard to guess either. Ryan explained: Clients say to me that with a lot of sexual encounters they have the guy makes it about him, he comes and then it’s over. They want the focus to be on them. Many do like reciprocating, but they want their pleasure to be in focus. Now, although this seems like the most mundane and incredibly obvious answer ever, it’s hard to argue against Ryan because, after all, he’s in high demand across the entirety of Australia. Ryan can’t even take on new clients because he’s fully booked up with his current ones throughout the foreseeable future. So there you have it folks – more attention with a side order of companionship. Pretty simple really...\n",

            "Paragraph: If you have any of the following items in your fridge, remove them immediately! Studies show that many Americans make several of these common refrigerator mistakes. Please take a moment to learn which foods should never be refrigerated. I can’t believe I didn’t know this! 1. Potatoes The refrigerator cold will turn the potato’s starch into sugar, giving them an \"off\" flavor. 2. Tomatoes Tomatoes turn mushy in the fridge and the cold will stunt their natural flavor. 3. Garlic The cold will cause garlic’s taste to fade and make everything in your fridge smell like garlic — no bueno! 4. Bread Contrary to popular belief, the only thing refrigerating bread will do is dry it out. If you want your bread to last longer, keep it in a bread box on your counter, or in a cupboard. 5. Onions Due to the cold, refrigerating onions will cause all of their flavor to be zapped. 6. Honey Honey has a long shelf life outside of the fridge, so if you’re thinking that it will make it last longer — you’re wrong. According to Diply, putting honey in the fridge will make it crystalize and it will no longer be spreadable. Don’t ruin your honey. The bees worked so hard to make it. Keep it in your cupboards. 7. Basil Many people make the mistake of assuming that basil will live longer in the cold. But the truth is, basil needs warmth. Cold will kill the flavor. Put your basil in water and change the water every couple of days, this will keep it happy and fresh. 8. Whole Melons Refrigerating a whole melon will cause it to lose it’s antioxidants. Don’t miss out on the huge health benefit that they are! Keep melons outside of your fridge until opened. 9. Apples I know, I know; this one blew me away too! Apples are actually proven to stay crispier and more flavorful when kept outside of the fridge. 10. Spices If you think you’re doing yourself a favor by refrigerating your spices, you’re wrong! The cold will cause them to lose their flavor, thus destroying the whole point of spices! 11. Ground Coffee Coffee should always be stored in an air-tight container outside of the fridge. 12. Baked Goods The cold will cause your breads to prematurely go stale. Don’t do it! 13. Hot Sauce The cold will weaken the flavor and change the viscosity, making your favorite hot sauce difficult to pour. Just don’t do it! 14. Fruits With Stones (ie: Peaches, Plums, Nectarines...etc.) Fight the urge to throw everything from the produce section in the fridge, and let these babies get some air on your countertop. 15. Oils Other than nut oils — which should be refrigerated — oils shouldn’t be refrigerated, the cold will harden them and cause them to become cloudy.\n",

So it’s a robotic style.\" (via The Daily Mail) At the beginning of Eddie Jones’ tenure, Campese also argued: \"The whole idea about rugby is playing on the field and entertaining people and getting people to come and watch the game. I think that Eddie will do the job, you’ll win, but it’s not going to be the fanciest style of rugby.\" (via The BBC) But the winger is not afraid to admit when he is wrong and once famously agreed to walk around London wearing a sandwich board that said as much, after agreeing to do so if England won the World Cup final in 2003 against Australia – they duly obliged.

But she didn’t lock the doors Monday night, which apparently puts you at risk for a bear break-in. ( The more you know !) \"My mom screamed from downstairs and I thought that I was in trouble,\" Bruecker told KMGH. \"She said, ‘Annie, there’s a bear in your car.’ \" Um, come again? \"He’s tossing stuff in the back basically and then you can see the ceilings of my car just ripped and I was like, I’m not going to work today,\" the teen \"He’s tossing stuff in the back basically and then you can see the ceilings of my car just ripped and I was like, I’m not going to work today,\" the teen told Fox affiliate KDVR Yeah, no kidding. Two deputies with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office — a department that has plenty of experience with animal-related calls — responded Tuesday. The bear had somehow entered and locked itself inside the car, and the deputies couldn’t figure out how, the department said in a statement. \"No windows were broken. The door handles weren’t the kind you lift up. And yet somehow this medium-sized bear managed to open a door, crawl inside and close the door behind him,\" according to the department. \"Deputies could tell by all the moisture on the windows that he’d clearly been inside for a while. \"Given the size of the bear, they also wondered if there was a mama bear nearby.\" The bear does look kind of small, though large enough to inflict some serious auto damage. As one deputy approached the car, the bear clawed at the window. Uhhhhhhhhh, TOO CLOSE! (Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office) \"Yeah, stay away from me, bear,\" the deputy can be heard saying in the video. \"He’s clawing at stuff. I hope he doesn’t hit the latch.\" The deputies eventually decided the safest thing to do would be to pop open the hatch. But the door wouldn’t open with the key fob button, the department said. So one deputy had to manually open the car’s door. As in, be physically close to a Subaru with a distressed bear trapped inside. Another deputy stood nearby with a shotgun — \"just in case,\" the department said. \"Thankfully once the door was open the bear had no interest in deputies, only in getting back into the wild,\" the sheriff’s office said.

After all, lifestyle comparison against the best everyone else has to offer, is not a fair contest. Regardless, how do you find out who's been checking up on you? Facebook has just added a new feature, which is startlingly similar to one found on rival platform Snapchat, that allows you to find out. The company said that they will never permit features that allow other users to see who viewed their profile, which happens in networks like LinkedIn. However, the new 'Stories' feature on the Facebook app allows you to see who has viewed your stories and specifically which parts of it. Much like Snapchat lets you know when people view your stories. Or like Facebook-owned Instagram, which introduced the feature after it saw the success on Snapchat. Or like Facebook Messenger. Or Facebook-owned Whatsapp. Facebook has prominently placed the feature in all its apps now, begging the question; why do you need four different versions of the app on your phone, just because they don't like a little social media competition? In fact, why do you need an app that just exists to flog crap to you through ads and sell your data and personal information to advertisers?\n",

            "Topic: Utah Republican Lawmaker, Mormon Moms Fight For Cannabis Oil For Epileptic Kids\n",
            "Paragraph: A conservative Republican Utah state lawmaker is backing an unexpected group of advocates: Mormon moms fighting for medical cannabis for their children. State Rep. Gage Froerer (R-Huntsville) has committed to help Hope 4 Children With Epilepsy, an advocacy group fighting for safe access to cannabis oil. The oil contains little to no THC, the chemical that causes the high in marijuana, but is high in cannabidiol, a compound that may fight seizures in some forms of epilepsy. Though legal in neighboring Colorado, the oil is not legal in Utah. Froerer said he hopes to change that with his support of the group, which was founded by four Mormon moms. \"If there’s anyone who can do it, it’s conservative Mormon moms from Utah,\" joked Hope 4 Children With Epilepsy cofounder Jennifer May in a phone call with The Huffington Post. May’s son, Stockton, 11, suffers from a rare form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, which causes five to 30 seizures per day. May told The Associated Press that she used to think giving a marijuana derivative to children was crazy. But after witnessing unbelievable success stories like that of Charlotte Figi -- a 6-year-old girl who suffers from the same syndrome as May's son -- she changed her tune. \"We’re not expecting this to be any kind of miracle cure,\" May said. \"But the results thus far with the children have been amazing with very little side effects. It’s just something that needs to be available.\" May considered moving her family to Colorado to get safe access to cannabis oil for her son. \"But we decided it wouldn’t do anyone else any good if we just left and didn’t fight to get this here. \"Some people think we’re crazy for not just going over there and bringing it back,\" May said. \"But when you think about how often our kids are in the hospital, our choice is between telling our physicians and risking getting in trouble, or not telling our physicians and risking life-threatening drug interactions with our children.\" Instead, May joined other parents of children with disabilities to rally for cannabis oil access in Utah. May and her cofounders are careful to distance themselves from medical marijuana. \"In Utah, a medical marijuana program is not going to go over very well,\" May said. \"Politicians here have promised to never let medical marijuana in the state and we don't want to be seen as a toe in the door.\" May said she hopes the state can simply categorize cannabis oil as legal instead of legalizing medical marijuana. \"It’s not making the kids high, it’s shown to be effective, but it’s labeled as medical marijuana,\" May said. \"We want to change that.\" After convincing Froerer, that goal may soon be a reality. In a meeting with Utah's Substance Abuse Advisory Council next month, Froerer will appeal to the council to legalize cannabis oil with a THC content of less than 0.5 percent -- less than that found in hemp oil at the grocery store. He has committed to sponsoring legislation, if necessary. \"As legislators, I think we have a duty to think about what’s best for the people of our state,\" Froerer told HuffPost. \"If we can provide this without causing any unintended consequences, we should do so.\" There have been no clinical trials testing cannabis oil for epilepsy, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. But there have been examples of success, including Charlotte Figi, the girl with epilepsy from a conservative Colorado military family shown on the CNN documentary \"Weed.\" Regular doses cut her seizures from 300 a week to 1, according to the documentary.\n",

            "Topic: 5 reasons why no one has built a better EpiPen\n",
            "Paragraph: oston mom Denise Clark has been buying EpiPens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy. Problem is, he won’t carry his EpiPen around with him — because it won’t fit into his pocket. \"It’s large and it’s impractical,\" Clark said. \"Where’s he going to put it?\" This underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren’t that great. They’re reliable, sure. They’ll buy a patient who’s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital. But they’re also bulky. Their epinephrine solution isn’t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. They expire after about a year. And they’re not so user-friendly. Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs. The devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608. Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is \"investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life.\" But critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: \"If you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — I don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,\" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law. \"EpiPen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug,\" Price said. Competitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen. And more are trying now that there’s such a spotlight on the product. But it’s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap. Here’s why: 1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025 Epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s. But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust. The company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack. The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. (Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.) \"If you’re a parent, and your child’s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection — and don’t want to read the instructions in that moment,\" said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants. \"You just have to know how to use it.\" Allen’s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. Those rules keep consumers safe. But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on Mylan’s patent. \"It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,\" Allen said. \"It’s not rocket science. It’s purely the patent that stops us.\" 2. There’s no room for error when you’re treating anaphylaxis Chris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that’s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years. Windgap’s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated. But that’s proving easier said than done. Stepanian said he’s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market. Though EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. Stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: \"It’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,\" he said. \"It’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,\" Stepanian added. \"At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.\" One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it’s \"in the process of evaluating when and how\" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market — but Sanofi is no longer involved. 3. It doesn’t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps In the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it’s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine. \"We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,\" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said. MannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. But it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler. Sales have been far below expectations. The same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis. 4. The regulatory process is slow and expensive A lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen. It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product. \"The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this,\" Baum said. \"But when the market was more normalized — when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk.\" Public anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk. Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it’s finally going to go for it. \"We’re just focused on being that competition,\" he said. 5. The public hasn’t spoken (loud enough) Denise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors. She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy. But though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines. \"It’s something that’s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I’ve looked at it closely — until I had to start paying all this money,\" Clark said. Granted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan’s pricing for years, and complaints about the device’s clunkiness are no secret. But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. That means there’s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation. \"I guess Mylan’s motto is, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’\" Clark said. \"They have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the EpiPen?\"\n",

            "Paragraph: It has become something of a media pastime to sift through the detritus of Donald Trump‘s online media archives in search of something no one has noticed before that might pop. While I was pretty sure that Trump’s 1993 interview with Howard Stern had already been picked through for comments about the women in his life, I checked it out anyway, and noticed something else weird. At the first commercial break, Stern tells Trump that later in the show, he’s going to ask to look inside Trump’s wallet. Then, a few commercial breaks later, Stern asks for the wallet, but instead of handing that over, Trump reaches into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a fat stack of unwrapped cash. That’s a weirdly convenient thing to have at the ready when you’re coincidentally trying to demonstrate that your financial situation has bounced back, but what’s even weirder is when Stern fans the cash out for the camera. Take a look: You can’t see all of them, but the five or six bills that are visible enough to make out are all single dollar bills. That means either Donald Trump really did carry around a sheaf of small bills in his jacket pocket instead of his wallet, or someone procured the flash roll during a commercial break for Trump to use as a prop. Maybe some enterprising reporter can settle this at Trump’s next press conference.\n",

            "Paragraph: A US scientist has accidentally proved a 200-year-old theory about jumping electric eels by famous 19th century explorer Alexander von Humboldt. The celebrated naturalist recounted witnessing a riverside battle between a group of horses and electric eels while on a trip in the Amazon in 1800. There have been no recorded sightings of electric eels attacking anything on the shore since, so it had been assumed that von Humboldt had exaggerated which he had seen. But biologist Professor Kenneth Catania, from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, found that the eels will jump out of the water to attack larger predators which when they become partially submerged in the water. While using a net with a metal rim handle to move them, he noticed that after a while the eels stopped trying to dodge the net and began to rise out of the water to press their chins to the handle and \"generated a series of high-voltage pulses\". After noticing the phenomenon, he designed an experiment when he placed them in a tank with prosthetic human arms and alligator heads - covered with a conductive metal strip and LED lights to show the electricity generated - partially submerged in the water. He filmed them jumping up and using their chins on the side of the head and the arm to amplify the electric shock. Prof Catania said the jolt of electricity created by eels is much weaker in the water, but if they extend themselves out of the water they distribute the shock directly at the animal that they perceive is threatening them. He explained: \"This allows the eels to deliver shocks with a maximum amount of power to partially submerged land animals that invade their territory. \"It also allows them to electrify a much larger portion of the invader’s body\". The scientist said he had dismissed von Humboldt’s findings initially saying: \"The first time I read von Humboldt's tale, I thought it was completely bizarre.Why would the eels attack the horses instead of swimming away?\" In the study, published online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Prof Catania explained that the leaping behaviour is likely to have evolved in several stages. Getting closer to the target would have increased the effectiveness of the shocks. Later generations of eels would have improved the accuracy of their leaping to the extent they were able to make direct contact with their victims. He concluded: \"Each stage provides a successive advantage, suggesting how it may have evolved\". Prof Catania thinks it is \"reasonable to suggest that von Humboldt observed a similar eel behavior on March 19th of 1800\".\n",

            "Paragraph: When it comes to dining in Rome, there's a pasta dish to avoid—unless you know the one place to try it. There seems to be molto confusion around the origins of fettuccine Alfredo. Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes—not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu. But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now—loaded with cream, often with chicken—is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't). Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you’ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won’t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers. Which, in Rome, is rewarding in its own right.\n",

            "Paragraph: Hundreds of people are packed into a bumping basement club in downtown Berlin, dancing for hours on end in a free-wheeling rave. The substance of choice hails from the exotic tropics. It’s said to impart a brain-boosting rush and tons of energy, enough to transform its users into raging Energizer bunnies. This drug can be ingested, drunk and even snorted. You’re probably familiar with its common name: cacao. Say, um, \"hi\" to the sweetest party drug there is. In recent months, cacao has transcended its already lofty status as a superfood and vaulted into the realm of party drugs. In this latest incarnation, cacao powder is taking the place of alcohol and illicit substances like Molly and ecstasy in parts of Western Europe. Lucid, a monthly cacao-fueled dance party in Berlin, fixes bitter Balinese cacao into partygoers’ drinks. Morning Gloryville, a rise-and-shine rave company that organizes dance parties from London to New York, stocks its bar with cacao drinks and cacao pills. And in perhaps the strangest form, Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone invented a special $50 snorting device so you can huff your chocolate in powdered form, much like cocaine. Never mind that this is the same raw powder you can find at the corner Vitamin Shoppe or processed in your favorite candy bar — or that cacao is perfectly legal in all the jurisdictions we found. Proponents say that raw, virgin cacao is far more potent than you ever imagined. First comes a surge of endorphins into your bloodstream, which increases acuity and fuels you with feelings of euphoria. Then there’s the flood of magnesium, which relaxes your muscles and de-tenses your body. Raw cacao is also chock-full of flavanols that increase blood circulation and stimulate brain power, according to a recent study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. And, of course, cacao can be downright delicious. Lucid’s pixie-like party organizer, Ruby May, isn’t a purist when it comes to the stuff: She spikes the 18 pounds of cacao per party with sweet hints of honey, agave syrup and cinnamon, and the celebrations go on for six hours. \"It’s like a smooth, sensual hug in a cup,\" says the 36-year old. And as far as the sniffing chocolate goes, Persoone mixes the powder with ginger, raspberry and mint for his patrons in Belgium. Chili pepper was tried, he says, but was \"not a good idea.\" Color us surprised. To be clear, cacao is not going to distort your reality. Under the beats of house, hip-hop, funk and electronic music, cacao \"amplifies\" the experience, rather than dims it with alcohol or drugs, says May. In fact, she doesn’t allow booze inside. The mood-boosting effects of cacao are \"subtle,\" she says, and it’s not like tripping on acid. Even pure cacao is not actually a drug. While it does contain certain mood-enhancing compounds such as anandamide and phenylethylamine, the bitter reality is that the amount is much too low to have any direct influence on mood, says Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, the director of research and development for Mars Symbioscience, a scientific division of Mars, Incorporated. Which is to say that all of this alleged chocoholism is probably a placebo effect. If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice. All of these concoctions come courtesy of the \"conscious dance movement,\" which evolved from an underground movement into morning raves and lunchtime dance parties, often attended by millennial office workers. It seeks to create a positive — and healthy — environment, in which participants can unhinge themselves from negative thoughts and social inhibitions. Alcohol is usually a no-no, as are illegal drugs. Self-actualization, communal bonding and calorie-burning are key. If it sounds like G-rated fun, well, it is; these are parties where virtue handily wins over vice. (Indeed, a kindergartner’s birthday party, with ice cream and cake, hits more deadly sins than this.) But such events have found an audience. One of Lucid’s attendees was 51-year-old Réka Komáromi, an ethnobotanist based in Canterbury. She says the raves help her to overcome the sorrow of her daughter’s untimely cancer — to \"get rid of the sadness\" and \"allow me to access my anger.\" Now that she’s fully steeped into this scene, she can’t get enough of cacao or its mellowing effects, especially for such \"psychologically hard\" times in her life. The use of cacao was pioneered in millennia past by Mesoamerican civilizations. As early as 1900 B.C., archaeologists believe, the Mokaya people in what is now Mexico were fermenting cacao beans into liquid chocolate. The Aztecs, it seems, valued cacao so highly they would trade the beans as a form of currency. Today, the very ethically conscious may have a beef with chocolate, protesting that appropriating cacao from its Mexican origins for Eurotrash-like dance parties rings a wee bit colonial. Skepticism aside, cacao can act as a \"catalyst for having more life,\" says May, rather than \"numbing ourselves with beer.\" And \"in all my years in research, I have never seen a person not smile when enjoying a piece of chocolate,\" adds Kwik-Uribe. Admittedly, she has a vested interest — but on the other hand, we can’t imagine a party that can’t be improved by chocolate.\n",

            "Topic: What Your Gut Bacteria Say About You\n",
            "Paragraph: The 100 trillion microbes that live in your gut know -- and influence -- you from the inside out. So what can they tell you about yourself? Here's a taste... By Jena Pincott \"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\" Try this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers. \"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\" OK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them. \"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\" A bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned. \"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\" Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight. \"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\" While the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.) \"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\" Good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota. \"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\" Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO. (But burger lovers, be heartened: Scientists are working on ways to identify and eventually target the villain bacteria.)\n",

            "Paragraph: It seems like a no brainer but we should probably start this article off with a good ol’, \"You probably shouldn’t try this at home,\" disclaimer. Seriously, don’t. No matter how cool (literally) this experiment is. The aptly named YouTube channel Crazy Russian Hacker is up to his crazy Russian hacking tricks yet again—this time with an experiment apt for the arrival of summer: He combined about 30 pounds of dry ice with a beautiful hillside swimming pool. What we call dry ice is actually the solid form of carbon dioxide and, put simply, is extremely cold. The neat trick that frozen CO2 plays in normal atmospheric pressure is that it has the ability to skip over its liquid state and go from a solid directly into a gas. This process, called sublimation, happens at a very cold −109.3 °F which, among other things, means that dry ice should never be handled with bare hands. You can actually see the Crazy Russian Hacker make this mistake a few times in the video as he reels from even the most brief contact with the dry ice. To speed its sublimation, and to trigger this awesome effect, chunks of the frozen CO2 are dropped into the swimming pool which causes quite the show. Plumes of carbon dioxide gas billow from the surface of the pool as the pieces appear to boil beneath the surface of the water. Some may have seen a similar trick done with liquid nitrogen, which, as you can imagine, is vastly more dangerous. A few years back, an event hosted by Jägermeister caused eight people to suffer injuries and landed one person in a coma after tanks of the much colder substance were poured into a pool. While the reaction isn’t toxic, what likely happened is that the cloud of vapor displaced the breathable oxygen of the pool goers, causing them to pass out. Though everyone recovered, the incident does mark the one and only time that Jägermeister wasn’t the most harmful liquid at a pool party. We should note that although dry ice is more attainable and somewhat safer than liquid nitrogen (not by much, guys—really, don’t do this at home), similar oxygen displacement can occur. So if you’re thinking of making your swimming pool into a witch’s cauldron this summer, you probably shouldn’t swim in it. Over-inhalation of CO2 can result in hypercapnia, which, as we’re sure you can guess, isn’t too much fun. Have you had any run-ins with the dryest ice around? Let’s have a \"cool\" conversation in the comments below! Image: Crazy Russian Hacker\n",

It received 11 Tony Awards, including best musical, and 16 Tony nominations, the most nominations in Broadway history. It won the Pulitzer Prize and a Grammy Award. In his review, Ben Brantley writes: \"Yes, it really is that good.\" It’s one of the most talked about Broadway shows since \"The Book of Mormon\" in 2011. Why? It’s a theatrical rarity: a critically acclaimed work, written by a young composer, that’s making a cultural impact far beyond Broadway’s 40 theaters. That it’s told through the language and rhythms of hip-hop and R&B — genres that remain mostly foreign to the musical theater tradition — has put it in contention to redefine what an American musical can look and sound like. As Mr. Brantley wrote in his review of the show Off Broadway, the songs in \"Hamilton\" could be performed \"more or less as they are by Drake or Beyoncé or Kanye.\" Ethel Merman it ain’t. So what’s the story behind a show that’s become a Broadway must-see with no marquee names, no special effects and almost no white actors?

            "Paragraph: Instagram Stories has brought Instagram and Snapchat into direct competition. And while Snapchat has the cachet of being the originator of the Stories format, the closed nature of its platform means that it lacks the same network effects as Instagram. If Snapchat wants to succeed against Instagram in the long-run – in both the domain of ephemeral sharing and more broadly in social media – then it might need to take a leaf from its rival's Instagram page and emulate the open-nature of its network. Network effects cause a product's value to compound as more users buy in. Every successful social platform (including Snapchat) owes its prosperity to network effects. As more users sign up, there are more people to connect with and more content to interact with. This increases the benefits of being the platform, which keeps existing users on platform and attracts new sign ups. On the other hand, flailing social networks fall short because \"they never caught on\" and hit critical mass, while extinct social networks die out when no one uses their platform anymore. The openness of Instagram's platform and its superior user base give it a key advantage over Snapchat. Instagram counts over 300 million daily active users (DAUs), almost double that of Snapchat. Users on Instagram can thus potentially tap into a much larger audience. Moreover, Instagram's platform is open and encourages the discoverability of new content, which helps the audience-building endeavor. In contrast, Snapchat's is more closed and difficult to find content on unless you already know exactly where to look.\n",

            "Paragraph: Even if you work out as often as you can, odds are that doesn’t translate into doing intense exercise every single day. And that’s actually a good thing—peppering your workout schedule with off days is often key for reaching your fitness goals because the time to recuperate can help your muscles get even stronger. But there’s some confusion about what it really means to take a \"rest day,\" a topic celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson covers in a new interview with The Cut. \"As long as you’re not being invasive for your body and muscles, you don’t need a day to relax and repair. You need a day to relax and repair when you’re abusing your body,\" she says in the interview. But that’s actually not true—taking a step back from your typical workouts is often a great idea, and it’s not only necessary if you’re \"abusing\" your body. \"You can’t expect someone to ‘go hard’ day in and day out and not think accumulated fatigue won’t enter the picture at some point,\" Boston-based certified strength and conditioning specialist Tony Gentilcore, tells SELF. Keep in mind that taking a rest day doesn’t always mean doing absolutely nothing, as Anderson notes: \"It’s so important to connect to yourself every day,\" she tells The Cut. But there’s a middle ground between a complete rest day and breaking a real sweat. That’s why Gentilcore and many other fitness experts recommend adding active recovery days into your workout routine. Basically, it means you engage in gentle activity to allow your body to rest and rebuild muscle fibers that you tear while exercising. That can be anything from going for a walk to doing light yoga or taking a chill bike ride—the key is to get up and moving. And a major perk is that this kind of activity can make your actual workouts even more effective. Consider active recovery the fitness rule you don’t want to break. Albert Matheny, M.S., R.D., C.S.C.S., of SoHo Strength Lab and Promix Nutrition, is a fan of active recovery. \"Active recovery is better than a rest day because your body and muscles recover faster with light work rather than complete rest,\" he tells SELF. Active recovery helps deliver blood to your muscles quickly, bringing nutrients and oxygen to help the muscles repair and recover, he says.Although this would happen even if you were at rest, the benefit of active recovery is that oxygen-rich blood pumps through your body faster when you’re moving, giving your muscles more of the fuel they need to repair the micro-tears that occur when you work out, Matheny explains. \"Active recovery days can be important in maintaining momentum while training,\" Doug Sklar, a certified personal trainer and founder of New York City-based fitness training studio PhilanthroFIT, tells SELF. \"Rather than completely forgo fitness, active recovery days allows you to do something healthful while still allowing your body to recover from a previous higher intensity workout.\" How you incorporate active recovery depends on the type and intensity of exercise you’re doing, as well as your personal goals. \"But generally speaking, it’s a good idea to balance high-intensity workouts with lighter work,\" Sklar says. Meaning, if you go for a long run one day, cut yourself some slack and go easier the next day. To help you figure it all out, here’s what a perfect week of working out looks like. Gentilcore says it’s also important to give yourself a break and take a full day of rest if you need it—physically or mentally. Maybe you’re sick, injured, would rather spend time celebrating a friend’s birthday than working out, or have any other very valid reason to skip an exercise session. Sometimes life gets in the way, and if you can’t always fit exercise in, that’s OK. Also know this: Rest and recovery days won’t derail your fitness goals. \"Just like you can’t become super-fit after one workout, you won’t lose all that you’ve worked for by taking one day off,\" says Sklar.\n",

On the other hand, if we are accused of something, she makes sure to have all the facts first. This mom knows a thing or two about fairness when it comes to kids, gender, and just in general, and her response to unfairness is incredible.

Principal: ‘Mrs. [My Name], how kind of you to FINALLY join us!’ Me: ‘Yeah, things get busy in ER. I’ve spent the last hour administering over 40 stitches to a seven-year-old who was beaten by his mother with a metal ladle and then I had to deal with the police regarding the matter. Sorry for the inconvenience.’ After watching him try to not act embarrassed, he tells me what has happened \"The boy had twanged my daughter’s bra and she had punched him in the face twice. I got the impression they were more angry with my daughter than the boy. Me: ‘Oh. And you want to know if I’m going to press charges against him for sexually assaulting my daughter and against the school for allowing him to do it?’ They all get jittery when I mention sexual assault and start speaking at once. Teacher: ‘I don’t think it was that serious \"Counselor: ‘Let’s not over-react.’ Principal: ‘I think you’re missing the point.’ The boy’s mother then starts crying. I turn to my daughter to find out what happened. Daughter: ‘He kept pinging my bra. I asked him to stop but he didn’t, so I told Mr. [Teacher]. He told me to ‘ignore it.’ [Boy] did it again and undid my bra so I hit him. Then he stopped.’ I turn to the teacher. Me: ‘You let him do this? Why didn’t you stop him? Come over here and let me touch the front of your trousers.’ Teacher: ‘What?! No! \"Me: ‘Does that seem inappropriate to you? Why don’t you go and pull on Mrs. [Counselor]’s bra right now. See how fun it is for her. Or on that boy’s mom’s bra. Or mine. You think just because they’re kids it’s fun?’ Principal: ‘Mrs. [My Name]. With all due respect, [Daughter] still beat another child.’ Me: ‘No. She defended herself against a sexual attack from another pupil. Look at them He’s a foot taller than her and twice as heavy. How many times should she have let him touch her? If the person who was supposed to help and protect her in a classroom couldn’t be bothered what should she have done? He pulled her bra so hard it came undone.’ The boy’s mom is still crying and his dad looks both angry and embarrassed \"The teacher won’t make eye contact with me. I look at the principal. Me: ‘I’m taking her home. I think the boy has learned his lesson. And I hope nothing like this ever happens again, not only to [Daughter], but to any other girl at this school. You wouldn’t let him do it to a member of staff so what makes you think he can do it to a girl of 15 is beyond me. I will be reporting this to the superintendent.

            "Paragraph: Most of us are familiar with the pounding headaches, drowsiness, stomach-turning nausea and \"did-I-get-run-over-by-a-bus\" sensation that comes with that most dreaded of morning-after ailments: the hangover. To alleviate the suffering, chugging coffee, downing Advil or simply choosing to forego the wretched day altogether by returning to bed sometimes does the trick. But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket? A group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of \"Sprite.\" After examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms. The team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms. Chemistry World explains it this way: Some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol’s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body. The Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH. Some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects. On the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde. The researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. However, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet. Edzard Ernst, a medicinal science expert from the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results. Do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by? Tell us below.\n",

Todd replied that, \"more importantly,\" that incorrect information \"would be stuff that Republicans have successfully messaged against it.\" He continued, \"They don't repeat the other stuff because they haven't even heard the Democratic message.\" Then came the fateful words: \"What I always love is people say, 'Well, it's you folks' fault in the media.' No! It's the President of the United States' fault for not selling it.\" That quote led to articles with headlines like \"Chuck Todd: It's Not Media's Job To Correct GOP's Obamacare Falsehoods,\" and \"MSNBC's Chuck Todd Explains Media Don't Need To Show You No Stinking Facts On Obamacare,\" and \"Inform the Public? Not My Job, Says Chuck Todd.\" Todd replied on Twitter: Somebody decided to troll w/mislding headline: point I actually made was folks shouldn't expect media to do job WH has FAILED to do re: ACA -- Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 18, 2013 I was NOT saying it isn't job of journos to call out lies, I said it was not job of media to sell WH's health care message, it is WH's job -- Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 18, 2013 Unfortunately for Todd, the controversy isn't going away. The latest salvo: a petition on the website Credo Mobilize, which had drawn 50,000 signatures by Saturday afternoon, a day after it was posted online. The petition's author, Nicole Belle, accused Todd of having \"completely abdicated his responsibility as a journalist.\" She also wrote a separate post on her blog at Crooks and Liars.

            "Paragraph: For years, Apple taught us to unlock iOS devices by swiping on the lock screen from left to right. The company even patented this technology, and gave Samsung and other Android device makers plenty of headaches over this method of unlocking a smartphone. But in iOS 10, Apple is killing the gesture, as it has other plans in mind for the lock screen and the phone unlocking mechanism. Slide-to-unlock is dead, long live Press-home-to-open! DON’T MISS: HBO is trolling ‘Game of Thrones’ fans with a very stupid decision That’s the new gesture you have to learn: pressing the home button to open the iPhone or iPad. But as our Chris Mills discovered while testing iOS 10, you will encounter a rather silly behavior, at least in the first beta. Ever since Touch ID was introduced, it was simple: place your finger on the home button, without pressing, and your phone will open. Simple, right? Well, not simple enough for Apple! In the new beta, if you've touched the lockscreen at all, using Touch ID will unlock the phone, but not open it. Instead, you first have to scan your finger, and then hit the home button to unlock your phone. It's the opposite of what Apple has been training us to do for years, and it feels glitchy and bad. So why is Apple killing the iconic iPhone slide-to-unlock? Because keeping it would only offer users a confusing experience in iOS 10. swipte-to-unlock-press-home-to-open More See those dots below the \"Press home to unlock\" text in the image above? They suggest that additional actions are available on the lock screen by swiping left or right. Swiping from left to right brings up the widgets screen, but the gesture can’t do two things at once. That’s why you won’t be able to swipe-to-unlock. Swiping from right to left will bring up the camera app. In iOS 9, you need to swipe from the bottom right corner upwards to activate the camera app. After so many years of swiping-to-unlock the iPhone, this change will probably annoy plenty of long-time users, at least at first. If, however, you've been relying on Touch ID to unlock iOS devices, the transition will be easier, provided you don't have to press the button after your fingerprint is scanned to actually unlock it. If you want to see these new iOS 10 lock screen features in action, watch Apple’s keynote starting at around the 50:00-minute mark.\n",

            "Paragraph: Also, seriously, doesn't that just hurt their junk? OK, so if you've ever spent any amount of time around a pool, you know one of the major rules is NO SITTING ON THE LANE LINE.  Unless you want your lifeguard and/or swim coach to go berserk on you for potentially breaking it/being lazy. But while watching the Olympic swimming events, you may have noticed that a bunch of the medalists...  SUN! NOOOOO! ...HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THE DAMN LANE LINES.  Adam, you're so beautiful they should name a Pantone color after you, but what the fuck are you doing on the lane line. \"Am I crazy?\" you might be asking. \"DON'T THEY ALL KNOW THERE'S NO SITTING ON THE LANE LINES?\"  DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER, MICHAEL? But rest assured, indignant pool-goer, people have noticed this massive transgression against pool etiquette:  Michael phelps would be the only swimmer in the world to get away with sitting on the lane line like that You are not taking crazy pills — sitting on the lane line is still not at all allowed.  All I can think with this Peaty kid is how has no one yelled at him over sitting on the lane line People are just as confused as you as to why this is happening, and how every lifeguard watching must be mad AF.  look at that little british boy sitting on the lane line like he hasn't been told not to nine times a day for all his whole life And they are not happy about it. WHY DO ALL THE SWIMMERS KEEP SITTING ON THE LANE LINES!? STOP! Clearly they've never had to restring a lane line before So don't worry: The world has not turned upside down.  I imagine one of the major perks of being an Olympic swimmer has got to be sitting on the lane line without getting yelled at WE HAVE OUR EYES ON YOU, OLYMPIC SWIMMERS WHO ARE SITTING ON LANE LINES. \n",

            "Paragraph: Peta Bee discovers how to take strain out of screen time Endless hours put into working and commuting mean the average Londoner spends many a waking hour hovering over a mobile phone or tablet. The result, warn experts, is an epidemic of the rounded shoulders and chronic pain that epitomise \"text neck\", the generational body ailment said to be induced by our addiction to technology. Last month, an Australian chiropractor revealed an alarming increase in the number of teenagers developing abnormally curved spines due to the hours they spend daily with necks bent over their smartphones. It follows several studies that have warned of the damage that can be caused by spending too long in a hunched position, with your head hanging forward. One New York-based expert went so far as to suggest that the undue pressure placed on our necks and upper backs by bad habits is so excessive that it causes wear and tear that could eventually necessitate surgery. In his study, published in the journal Surgical Technology International last year, Dr Kenneth Hansraj, head of spine surgery at New York Spine Surgery & Rehabilitation Medicine, said texting, typing and playing endless hours of Candy Crush Saga puts as much as 27kg worth of pressure on the cervical spine — or the equivalent of more than four stone in weight or the weight of an average seven-year-old child. It’s enough to make you sit poker-straight. Or at least think about how you can lessen the risks that come with using electronic devices. What can be done? Here are some of the best ways to prevent the dreaded hunchback: Get appy Your phone itself can give you the message to straighten up if you download the Text Neck Indicator, an app created by the Text Neck Institute in Florida (text-neck.com). Dr Dean Fishman, the chiropractor who founded the institute, designed the mobile app to remind users when they are, or are not, using good posture. If your phone is held at an unacceptable angle, a red indicator light appears in the top corner and the device beeps to warn you that your neck is under strain. It’s currently available for Android phones, but not yet on iPhones. Hang around Inversion tables and gravitational boots in which you can hang upside down are making a comeback among a generation plagued by back and neck pain. Sammy Margo, a spokesman for The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, describes inversion therapy as \"like a subtle form of traction for the back\" but stresses that it needs to be done properly. \"Our discs become compressed in everyday life and hanging therapy is a way of completely stretching the back out again,\" Margo says. Lying on a table or flat surface and allowing your body to hang down can help, as can hanging by your fingertips from a sturdy door frame. Or try a Teeter inversion table (from £395 johnlewis.com or backinaction.co.uk). Head back Garry Trainer, the Primrose Hill-based osteopath who counts Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney and Emma Thompson among his clients, says that, since many of us are tied to computers, mobile phones and tablets through our work, the key is to minimise tension in the neck area as much as we can. \"Being stuck in the same position for a long time isn’t good for your posture. You need to adopt more or less the opposite position every now and then to offset the risks,\" he says.  \"If you’re always looking down that means you need to tilt the head backwards, supporting it with lightly clasped hands, to reverse the effects every so often.\" Self-monitor If you don’t have the luxury of an off-the-scale expensive ergonomic chair, the PostureMinder software (£24.98 backinaction.co.uk) is a cheap option to keep tabs on any desk-based slumping. Using any webcam, the system continually checks your posture as you work, monitoring keyboard and mouse usage as well as prompting you when you need to take a screen break. Couple it with a Lumo Lift (£80 lumobodytech.com), a small sensor designed to be worn just below the collarbone that will buzz a reminder every time you slump your shoulders or next, and you are sorted. Work lying down If standing desks are not your thing, the latest innovation is a desk that allows you to lie down with your monitor positioned above you. Designed in California, the Altwork desk has a control panel that allows you to switch the position of your chair from sitting to lying or standing and to work in a posturally-perfect way.  Its manufacturers say your \"computer seamlessly moves with you, instead of forcing you to conform to it\", although the technology doesn’t come cheap. It goes on sale next year for £3,850 — but advanced orders costing £2,540 can be placed now at altwork.com.\n",

Florham Park, NJ 12/16/15 (Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) FLORHAM PARK — isn't just a hard-hitting safety in the Calvin Pryor isn't just a hard-hitting safety in the Jets ' secondary. He's apparently a hopeless romantic, too. Most people already know about the football part. All nearly got a glimpse into Pryor's love life, too. The 24-year-old told NJ Advance Media on Wednesday he was nearly the star of a bachelor-themed reality TV show this offseason. \"My agent called and asked me if I wanted to be,\" Pryor said. No, Pryor isn't joking. The concept of the show was going to be pretty simple: A handful of women — five or six, according to Pryor — would compete to win his heart. Pryor would take them on dates, and at the end of the series, he would pick which one he wanted. In a way, it's not much different than what Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is doing on his own reality TV show. \" Catching Kelce \" will debut on the E! channel Oct. 5. The show features 50 women try to earn Kelce's love. \"I thought it was a very cool idea with being on TV, the brand, and everything like that,\" Pryor said. \"It would have been fun to take all of them on dates.\" When Pryor's agent originally pitched him the concept, Pryor said he started to think of a few date locations and ideas. The show was apparently going to let him formulate his own plans for dates. The first was going to be a picnic, and the second a trip to the beach. He never got a chance to delve too much into the game planning, though. See, there's a minor holdup: Pryor isn't a bachelor. He has a girlfriend. And she wasn't too keen on him dating around. \"She cut me off before I could explain the details,\" Pryor said. \"I really didn't know if I could just do it for fun, or if it would have to be a serious thing. Once I asked my girlfriend, and she said 'no,' that ended that.\" Still, Pryor said he was flattered by being considered. \"What can I say?\" Pryor said with a smile. \"I'm a good-looking guy.\"\n",

To celebrate their 20th anniversary, The Spice Girls are getting the band back together, sort of. The catch is only three of the five girls will be there, and they’re changing their name. Scary, Baby and Ginger Spice (AKA Mel Brown, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner) are getting together under a new band name, GEM, which stands for the first letter of their names. Meanwhile, Sporty Spice (Melanie C) and Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham) will not be joining them. The news came in an announcement video on a new Spice Girls GEM YouTube page, with the promise of more details on a special surprise coming soon. Now, there are several things to talk about here. First, can we talk about how Geri, Emma and Mel — international superstars who are now in their 40s — named their new band in the exact same way you named your imaginary band with your friends in middle school? Second, let’s talk about how this video looks like it was made in the 2009 version of iMovie. And Ginger Spice just straight up filmed herself in selfie mode on her iPhone.

            "Paragraph: Social media has many wonderful uses, but perhaps our favorite use of social media is making our friends jealous of our fabulous lives. Perhaps that’s what 22-year-old Melina Roberge and 28-year-old Isabelle Lagacé were shooting for when they posted photos from their world, documenting stops in Bermuda, Chile, Ecuador, and New York. However, things took a weird turn when the girls took a luxury cruise from England to Australia. When the sea princesses took their final stop in Sydney, somebody was waiting for these fair maidens, but it was not Prince Charming... First Selfie The two girls originally hail from Canada, and on their world travels, they took every possible opportunity to pose in bikinis, show beautiful sunsets, and take selfies like this one pictured here. What the beach babes didn’t know? There was somebody sinister keeping an eye on their well-documented travels. Exploring New Places \"Gone to a place very peaceful • leave a message after the tone,\" the sultry sunbather writes on Instagram where she posted this photo in late July. She might have been in a peaceful place back then, but rest assured she’s nowhere peaceful now. A View To Die For With water that blue, it’s easy to be hypnotized by the breathless sea below. But what happens when the vacation comes to a jarring close? Looking out across the endless expanse of blue skies meeting the crisp horizon of water can make one think they’re infallible. What happens when they find out they’re not? World Traveler \"Made some new Colombian friends,\" Melina writes on an Instagram post of tropical birds. Little did she know, some less friendly friends were watching these travels from a land far far away and much less exotic. Sea Princesses Now, if you’re going to go on a luxury vacation, traversing the globe and venturing across land and sea, you have to do it with as much style as possible. In this case, that swag came in the form of a luxury cruise ship. The MS Sea Princess was how these beautiful maidens chose to travel. Only the best for princesses of the sea... It’s All Smiles Until Something Goes Wrong It’s easy to sit back and admire life from under a coconut tree while all your friends back home admire your coconuts too, but pretty soon the party must come to an end. And Life Just Took An Ugly Turn Yes, as those beautiful young women pulled into port, the Australian Border Force had an ugly surprise waiting for them. Turns out these girls were doing more than just traveling the globe. They were carrying much more than memories with them. Travel Therapy While the beautiful women were traversing the globe and setting their sights high, they were also involved in a huge drug ring. The ladies were carrying 35 kilos of cocaine in their bags. And that’s not the worst of it... Collect Moments Not Things While the ladies were busy collecting moments and memories, 63-year-old André Tamine was planning on collecting the stash. It’s unclear how Tamine is connected with the girls, but he himself was holding 60 kilos of cocaine. Tattoo Time Police collected in total a 95-kilo bust, making this whopping bust the biggest Australian drug seizure ever coming through a passenger boat or airport. Perhaps the strangest past of this story is the documentation on social media. While these girls were getting tattoos in French Polynesia, the police were getting data on their whereabouts. Freedom And while they were enjoying the feelings of being young and free, those feelings weren’t going to last long. Police were onto these travelers from day one. Mounting Evidence Had the girls succeeded in their efforts, they would have made more money than they knew what to do with. Due to its geographical location, Australia has the highest drug prices anywhere in the world. It’s hard getting drugs to the lonely continent, so smugglers can charge a hefty price. But unfortunately for this crew, the evidence was mounting... More Evidence Two suitcases were seized by authorities. Each contained a significant amount of narcotics. Obviously, carrying such an amount of illegal drugs, and smuggling said drugs across international borders, was a major crime. Third Wheel 63-year-old Andre Tamine was the other smuggler involved in the scam. Like the girls, he too was from Quebec and likely orchestrated the exchange. One wonders if he was enjoying a vacation of his own while he was arranging to meetup with the young ladies... Stash Found The girls didn’t make many efforts to cleverly disguise their stash. Perhaps that’s why they were found out so easily. As soon as authorities opened the bag, the stash was uncovered and their lives were changes forever. Innocence? The funny thing is that the girls were instructed to keep their Instagram public and updated, which gave the media an unusual view into their drug-addled lives. Sure they look innocent as they vacation across the globe but who knew what hid just below the surface? Punishment According to a CBS News report, \"Roberge was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months in prison before she is likely to be deported to Canada.\" And Isabelle was sentenced to \"to 7 ½ years in prison backdated to their arrest. Lagace will also likely be deported after serving a non-parole period of 4 ½ years.\" Lesson Learned The third accomplice of this story, Andre Tamin, was sentenced to eight years in prison for his crimes, according to a report from The Star.\n",

Non-beef options include seafood, veggie, chicken and turkey patties. The tuna burger, for example, contains sushi-grade ahi tuna, sriracha aioli and caramel soy and avocado, combined with more traditional burger toppings, like lettuce and tomato. The Greek is a veggie burger with roasted peppers, a feta spread and pickled cucumbers. The 21st burger on the menu rotates on the 21st of each month, allowing the company to test out new ideas. \"We're not just checking another box off the list,\" Sawyer said. BurgerFi is a good place to examine the existential crisis of the classic beef patty. The Florida-based chain, with 88 locations (it owns 20 percent of them), is trying to cover every potential burger customer, and that includes a very small customer niche that it is more or less in the process of inventing. Its classic BurgerFi cheeseburger is the chain's most popular. It also offers a veggie burger, called the VegeFi burger, made with quinoa, lentils, carrots, zucchini, sauteed mushrooms and onions. It accounts for close to 15 percent of sales. But for a small group of customers who can't decide between the beef or veggie patties, BurgerFi features the Conflicted Burger, which contains both a natural Angus burger and veggie burger. It generates about 3 percent of burger sales.\n",

I’m totally messing with you. There’s no asteroid (at least not about to strike next week). But there is a new study by computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institute that has found that 59 percent of links shared on social media have never actually been clicked, meaning that most people who share news on social media aren’t actually reading it first. For the study, Arnaud Legout and co-authors collected two data sets: \" the first, on all tweets containing Bit.ly-shortened links to five major news sources during a one-month period last summer; the second, on all of the clicks attached to that set of shortened links, as logged by Bit.ly, during the same period. After cleaning and collating that data, the researchers basically found themselves with a map to how news goes viral on Twitter. The map showed \"viral\" news is widely shared but not necessarily read. According to the Washington Post, one thing study authors say is concerning about this is that it shapes the way we see the world. Legout said in a statement: \" \"People are more willing to share an article than read it. This is typical of modern information consumption. People form an opinion based on a summary, or a summary of summaries, without making the effort to go deeper.\" This probably won’t shock most people. We see it all the time in comments sections – people making loud proclamations about stories they clearly haven’t read. Entire discussions are chaired by those who didn’t actually RTFA (Read the Fucking Article). It’s maddening. What can you do about it? RTFA, of course, and don’t share things you haven’t read.

According to Us Weekly, Kim snapped a photo of four products all from the luxurious La Mer brand — The Perfecting Treatment, The Concentrate, The Renewal Oil, and the iconic Crème de la Mer. The total cost for this high-end skin treatment? A whopping $1,230. That’s rent money, people. For decades, La Mer has been the crème de la crème (no pun intended) when it comes to facial moisturizers. The brand’s website claims it has the power to completely \"transform the skin,\" and making it look \"virtually ageless.\" With those statements, it’s no wonder La Mer is a longtime favorite of makeup artists and celebs, as well as the source of legend — Mariah Carey was once rumored to use La Mer as diaper cream for her babies and Jennifer Lopez was said to have applied the stuff on her body from head to toe. Could you imagine? Kim also made sure to say that she wasn’t getting paid for promoting the product, which can be considered more proof that La Mer may very well live up to its hype. While some of us might only be able to fantasize about using La Mer in our own morning skincare routines, we still might be able to try another favorite of Kim’s, such as Kiko’s Scrub & Peel wipes by the Italian cosmetics brand, Kiko Milano. If you can get your hands on them, the exfoliating wipes only go for about 6 pounds, or around $8.50 USD. That sounds way more doable than $1230!

            "Paragraph: One mother shares the story of how her \"not uncommon\" pregnancy turned into one of the most terrifying experiences of her life, according to Women's Health. Kathleen Lombardo and her husband had struggled to get pregnant for over a year, so when she discovered she was expecting, they were both ecstatic. Despite a diagnosis of gestational diabetes and a bout of flu during her pregnancy, everything went as expected, she wrote in Women's Health in 2014. Selfie challenge day 3! Ten days, ten nominations, ten selfies. In the words of Kim Kardashian: \"selfies are the purpose of life.\" I nominate Tammy. Posted by Kathleen Lombardo on Wednesday, November 25, 2015 Lombardo said the first sign that something wasn't right came moments after the birth of her son, when the nurse noticed that she had two amniotic sacs. The nurses sent the placenta off to pathology and Lombardo promptly forgot about it, she said. Four weeks postpartum things took a turn for the worse. She began bleeding heavily and had severe stomach cramps. Doctors told her nothing was wrong and refused to see her until her six-week checkup. Lombardo said she felt like something was wrong but trusted the doctors knew what was best, according to Women's Health. At that six-week checkup Lombardo received life-changing news. She had developed choriocarcinoma, a pregnancy-induced cancer that affects roughly 1 in 500,000 people, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine . Doctors think she may have developed a molar pregnancy shortly before, or during her successful pregnancy, which developed into cancerous cells. Posted by Kathleen Lombardo on Tuesday, December 15, 2015 Lombardo says she was lucky. \"My cancer metastasized to my lung. I was lucky because that made me only stage III. If left unchecked, the cancer can spread to the liver, lungs and eventually, the brain,\" she wrote in Women's Health. Lombardo underwent 13 rounds of chemotherapy and was unable to touch her son for weeks due to the heavy-duty chemo drugs she was on, she said in Women's Health. Now Lombardo encourages women to take control of their health, \"If you ... feel what I felt — that instinct, that feeling that you couldn't put your finger on — please, tell your doctors that you need to be seen immediately. Don't assume that a quick phone call to an on-call doctor or nurse will suffice if you are sure something is wrong,\" she said.\n",

            "Paragraph: The Colorado State University community is reeling over two 18-year-old freshmen students who were found dead in their dorm rooms in separate incidents during the month of October. The Coloradoan identified the students as Nikita Krasko, who died of hanging in his dorm room, Durward Hall, on Oct. 12. The other, Amelia Sundblad, died in her dorm room at Westfall Hall on Oct. 23. Sundblad's cause of death is still under investigation. \"It’s the second one this month, so it’s kind of ...

            "Paragraph: Nick Johnson has caught every Pokémon in Pokémon Go that is available in the U.S. So now what? An international trip, he tells USA TODAY. Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about Pokemon trainers flocked from around the Bay Area to attend San Francisco's Pokemon Go Crawl where they met fellow trainers and talked Pokemon over discounted themed drinks. Nick Johnson is the first person to announce he has collected every Pokémon in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. That is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of North America. So now what? Off on an international trip to catch the Pokémon elsewhere in the world — underwritten by an international travel company. Marriott Rewards has offered to sponsor Johnson to go to Europe, Japan and Australia to catch the regionally based Pokémon and finish his collection, he told USA TODAY Friday. A Marriott spokesman confirmed the trip. ​Using GPS and augmented reality, the game developed by Niantic Labs invites players to catch the colorful Pokémon monsters best known from Nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s. In the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open — a scenario that's encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions. \"I feel great,\" Johnson said. \"I was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people. I’m a lot healthier — I think I lost about 8-10 pounds.\" Launched in early July , the hardcore users are now looking for the rare Pokémon. Mr. Mime , Farfetch'd and Kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in Europe, Asia and Australiasia, respectively. However, it is rumored these Pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in North America that users can pick up at PokeStops. \"I’ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100's of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in North America) as far as I know,\" Johnson said. The Brooklyn-based tech worker announced this week he had nabbed the 142 local monsters on Reddit with a screenshot of his Pokedex, and later confirmed this feat to Business Insider He owes his new fame to plain old shoe leather. Central Park . Many times they would get to know fellow Pokémon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when Pokémon tend to spawn. After getting off at work around 6:00 pm at Applico, a platform innovation company , Johnson would meet up with his girlfriend, have dinner and then together head down to Pokémon hotspots such as Grand Army Plaza in. Many times they would get to know fellow Pokémon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when Pokémon tend to spawn. If she decided to leave before him, he said she would give him her phone to help her collect more monsters and he usually found himself heading home around 12 a.m. or 1 p.m., the normal time he goes to sleep. Johnson's iPhone Health App stated he has walked an average of 8 miles per day since the game was released on July 6th. Johnson said that he had a couple of nights, when he got around the 135 Pokémon mark, that kept him out till 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. This trainer's solution: heavy doses of black tea in the morning. Even so, he said he doesn't feel like the game affected his professional life, stating that Pokémon Go is a gaming platform and he works for a platform innovation company, so he felt like the game translated back into the work he did everyday. He's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model. He said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. Beside growing up playing the Pokémon games, of course. But staying out till 5 a.m. isn't what Johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for Pokémon, citing a story of trying to catch a Porygon. He said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the Pokémon Go radar was down so he had to order an Uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it. \"That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one,\" Johnson said. \"I was close to the end so it was extra motivation.\" As for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain Pokémon. \"I probably wouldn’t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn't got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City,\" Johnson said. Secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good. \"I learned that the hard way,\" Johnson said. For now, he's playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into Applico. At least for now until he takes his international Pokémon catching trip. \"My childhood dreams of being a Pokémon master have come true.\"\n",

            "Paragraph: Bestselling author Dr. Brené Brown is a research professor who has spent more than a decade studying vulnerability and worthiness. She says opening yourself up is one of the most powerful things you can do -- but during her appearance on \"Oprah’s Lifeclass,\"she warns that not everyone should be trusted. \"How do you make yourself be vulnerable with somebody you don't completely trust, like in a relationship?\" an audience member asks in the above video. \"You don't,\" Brown answers. \"Because you know what? This is it,\" she says, gesturing to her heart. \"What's under here is the most valuable thing you have. It's the most valuable gift you give to all of us. It's the most valuable offering you have in your life and people have to earn the right see it. They have to earn the right to see it and they have to know when they're seeing it that it's an absolute honor and privilege for you to have let them in.\" Oprah points to a similar question she and Brown received on Twitter: \"How do you foster an environment of #vulnerability when your partner sees it as #weakness?\" \"If you're being vulnerable, you're opening up your heart, and the other person thinks that that's weak of you -- you are with the wrong person,\" Oprah says. \"It's an awesome filter,\" Brown agrees. As an example, Brown tells a story of a time she tried to be vulnerable with one of the mothers at her daughter's school. \"I was talking to someone and I was like, 'Oh, yeah, last year there was a whole week where every day I gave the wrong kid the wrong lunch half the time,'\" Brown shares. \"And she looked at me and she goes, 'Oh, I don't think I've ever had that experience.'\" \"And I was, like, off the list, baby!\" Brown says. Though in this case it was easy for Brown to see that this woman didn't deserve her vulnerability, she goes on to say that in other cases, it can be painful. \"Here's what's scary, and we should not B.S. you about this,\" Brown says. \"You start trying this on,\" she says -- meaning becoming more authentic and vulnerable -- \"there will be a pushback. You're going to freak out some people. You're going to scare some people.\" By showing your vulnerability to someone, Brown explains that you're asking that person to be vulnerable in return. \"The pushback will be, what are you doing? We had a deal. You keep this closed. I keep this closed. That was our deal,\" she says. \"This is transformational stuff,\" Brown says. Part two of Oprah's conversation with Brown on \"Oprah's Lifeclass\" airs Sunday, Oct. 6 at 9 p.m. ET on OWN.\n",

            "Paragraph: When I was seven, I joined hen I was seven, I joined the Brownies . At the time, becoming part of Baden-Powell’s famous organisation felt very grown up. However, when I reflect on the experience, I realise that being a Brownie is worth doing only if you start when you’re very young. It’s full of peculiar rituals, and only now that I am 31, and no one incentivises me to do anything by offering me a special badge, do I recognise how odd some of them were We were given badges for applying bandages to our ungrazed knees, remembering to keep a sewing kit in the pockets of our culottes, and successfully using a payphone to make a call. I’ll always remember the day 24 Brownies were walked into the nearest village, and each given a 10pto call our mums and tell them that we were still at Brownies, everything was fine and that we would see them in 40 minutes. From that moment, I saw telephone conversations as exciting events. They were fraught with romance, glamour and danger, and could only be approached if you were under strict supervision, unless you were a proper adult. I would have been overwhelmed if anyone had predicted that when I was an adult, I would have a portable phone for my exclusive use. I think I would have collapsed with shock if I had been told that I could use it to read books, play games, argue with strangers and identify vaguely recognisable songs that were being played in bars. If someone had said that I’d barely bother to make calls at all, I’d have told them they were a liar. But it’s true. More than three-quarters of all adults in the UK own smartphones, but 25% don’t use them to make calls Can we blame millennials for the demise of the phone call? Most of the twenty- and thirtysomethings I socialise with would rather suck Donald Trump’s toe than make or receive a call in order to have a chat. We’re in touch with each other constantly, but written communication allows us to participate in the conversation at the pace we choose. We don’t have to worry about misreading anyone’s tone when the words are laid out in black and white. However, it seems that phone-call phobia definitely isn’t confined to a single generation. Jeremy Corbyn’s aides complained that they were unable to reach their boss on the telephone this week to discuss \"traingate\" because he was busy making jam Perhaps it’s not the phone calls themselves we object to, but the feeling of being ambushed by them Many millennials struggle with mental health, and we’ve been dubbed the \"anxious generation\" . As an anxiety sufferer, nothing fills me with dread and terror like a phone call from a withheld number. The trouble is that the issue exacerbates itself. Because we don’t call for chats, I assume that whenever anyone does try to reach me on the telephone, it’s because of a bad, sad, serious emergency and I need to be reached urgently, possibly for a telling off. So I fling the phone from my hand, as if it’s a live snake, and then get a voicemail from someone who was just ringing for a catch-up. \"But it’s not urgent, we can just do it on WhatsApp.\" Perhaps it’s not phone calls themselves we object to, but the feeling of being ambushed by them. One worker in their 20s told the Wall Street Journal: \"Calling someone without emailing first can make it seem as though you’re prioritising your needs over theirs.\" That’s right. The millennial attitude towards phone calls is actually about manners. We’ve grown up with so many methods of communication available to us, and we’ve gravitated towards the least intrusive ones because we know how it feels to be digitally prodded on a range of different channels. Speaking on the telephone is an event, and we don’t want to avoid it – we just need to be sure that both parties have a chance to prepare for it. We want a chance to compose and edit our thoughts, in the way we do when we’re writing them down. There is an element of mindfulness involved too. Thanks to our phones, we’re never doing nothing, and if we’re surprised by a phone call we might struggle to give the caller our full attention. If we know when to expect it, we can at least try to focus in a way that we’re not always capable of during other moments of our lives. It’s fair to say that young people can still see the value of a phone call, but perhaps we understand it as something serious and significant, to be used in much more specific contexts and shared with a select group of people. We all have an inner circle who would be allowed to interrupt us for a chat when we’re in the middle of making jam. Everyone else will have to make do with a message.\n",

            "Paragraph: Longtime televangelist and first-class anti-gay pundit Pat Robertson nabbed a very fitting honor at the Stonewall Awards yesterday -- the very prestigious \"Bigot of the Year.\" The award is reportedly reserved for \"an individual who has gratuitously caused hurt and offense to gay people around the world,\" according to the Daily Mail. Robertson had some stiff competition for the title, managing to beat out notorious homophobe Niall Ferguson; Rev. George Gebauer, who came under fire for refusing to baptize a lesbian couple; Scott Lively, who has single-handily taken credit for inspiring Russia's anti-gay laws, and outspoken anti-gay adoption politician Winston McKenzie. So how did Robertson manage to claw his way to the top of the anti-gay totem pole this year? Let us count the ways: After inspiring hope in LGBT people everywhere by stating that he didn't think identifying as transgender was a sin, Robertson went on to compare transgender people to his castrated horse. In addition, the anti-gay pundit has claimed that LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances will put Christians in jail, and stated that gays are just straight people who have \"forsaken God.\" And who could forget his desire for a \"vomit\" button on Facebook so he could express his feelings surrounding LGBT-related posts? Perhaps most notoriously of all, Robertson made the claim that gays with AIDS wear special rings in order to cut other individuals when shaking hands and infect them with the disease in August. Another well-deserved honor, Pat.\n",

            "Paragraph: Earlier.. A deputy was stabbed and a prisoner is still on the run after allegedly escaping from a Detroit courthouse Monday morning. Police confirmed to The Huffington Post that a deputy was stabbed at the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in downtown Detroit around 8 a.m. The suspect, who was first identified as 25-year-old Derreck White, stabbed the deputy in the neck with a homemade shank made from a plastic comb and escaped with his uniform through an unguarded courthouse door. A statement from the Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon said Derreck White was actually an alias for Abraham Pearson, age 25. Pearson had three aliases, according to the local news station. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said that Pearson is a member of the \"Hot Boyz\" carjacking gang. Napoleon told the station that the incident occurred while the prisoner and two other inmates were being loaded into a cell. The prisoner allegedly turned a sharpened comb into a weapon, then took part of the deputy's uniform and used it to escape. The suspect then carjacked a 2000 grey Dodge minivan driven by a 58-year-old woman, who was unharmed, according to the Detroit Police Department. The escaped prisoner drove off in the vehicle shortly before being involved in a two-car accident while driving the minivan. A perimeter was established to find Pearson in an area near East Lafayette and Concord on the city's east side. The courthouse was under lockdown, but is now letting people back inside, according to the Detroit Free Press. The escapee is currently at large, and is said to be armed and dangerous. He is 5-foot-6 and weighs 155 pounds. He reportedly has a tattoo that says, \"Hot Boyz.\" The Free Press reports that Pearson was in court Monday to be sentenced on a host of charges, including carjacking, armed robbery, unlawful driving away of a vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, felony firearm, possession of a firearm by a felon and possessing a financial transaction device. He was reportedly found guilty during a bench trial on Aug. 26. The suspect's defense attorney, James Howarth, said his client was found competent to stand trial despite having a history of mental illness, the Associated Press reported. \"In his right mind he would not have done this,\" Howarth said. \"In the year I have known him, he has never showed the slightest symptom of being dangerous. Something is very wrong.\" Howarth said: \"It may have been a final act of desperation if you don't want to go to prison.\" The deputy's injuries are not life-threatening, and WXYZ reports the officer is being treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital. Anyone with information should contact the Wayne County Sheriff's Department at 313-224-0414.\n",

            "Paragraph: It’s every high schooler’s dream. But when this popular football player was voted homecoming king, he rejected the crown for a very unexpected reason. Now, this young man’s unorthodox response is sending shockwaves throughout his high school and around the world. This is powerful. Max Akin is Fossil Ridge High School’s favorite quarterback — and he’s a good one at that. In the first half of Friday’s homecoming game, the senior quarterback secured an impressive 200 passing yards, 60 rushing yards, and four touchdowns. But what this talented young quarterback did at half-time trumped his impressive performance on the field. And it’s simply beautiful. Seconds after Max Akin was crowned homecoming king, he took a knee to present his crown to fellow nominee and friend, K.L. Norwood, who has cerebral palsy. \"I think it should’ve gone to the person who positively uplifts the school and everybody around him,\" Max said, \"and that person is K.L., for sure.\" \"I didn’t know when I would have the right time to do it,\" Akin told WFAA. \"But I saw K.L., came over and gave him a hug, and I knew that he wanted that crown more than anything.\" Since then, Max Akin’s unusual gesture has taken the internet by storm. And it’s a beautiful sight to behold as the shared crown reminds the world that inviting someone into the spotlight is always sweeter than hogging it. What @CMaxAkin did last night was just amazing, you are a sweet guy Max:relieved: pic.twitter.com/RUSzAKMO9C — Nikki (@Nicoleruv_03) September 10, 2016 \"I thought it was the best hearing them chant K.L.’s name right after halftime, and I know he liked that, too,\" Akin said. \"Everybody was going wild for him. Everybody loves K.L. at this school.\" With plenty of negative stories in the media about reckless high schoolers, heartless bullies, and irresponsible teenagers, these two young men paint a beautiful picture of brotherhood and remind the world that there is hope for humanity. \"They love each other, and that’s why we’re successful,\" said Fossil Ridge Head Coach Tony Baccarini. This year, Fossil Ridge’s football team has gone undefeated. But no matter how this season ends, we’re quite certain that this beautiful moment will last a lifetime. Thank you, Max Akin and K.L. Norwood for your powerful stand for unity and love. America needs more young men like these two, please share if you agree! \"Be devoted to one another in love.

You can check out this GameSpot story to see even more of The Division's known issues caused by 1.2. Recently, Ubisoft acknowledged that The Division's end-game content was lacking. The new Incursion and the PvE activities that came to the game with 1.2 are designed to draw players back. This update is The Division's second free one, following Incursions in April. Paid expansions Underground, Survival, and Last Stand are coming later.\n",

            "Topic: ‘We both avoided it...’: Couple waits 9 years to open special wedding gift\n",
            "Paragraph: KALAMAZOO, Mich. — A couple married nine years ago says the best wedding gift they received actually sat unopened in their closet until just a few months ago. Kathy and Brandon Gunn shared their story in a post on the ‘Love What Matters’ Facebook page. The couple says they received the gift from Kathy’s great Aunt Alison. It was a plain white box with a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" The couple says they’ve had plenty of those through the years, but they never opened the box. \"I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure,\" the post says. \"To us, it would have meant that we didn’t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we’re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations.\" Recently, with a wedding coming up, the two sat down and tried to think of a gift for the newlyweds. They realized their favorite gift from their own wedding was the one they never opened. \"Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization,\" the post says. \"I realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box – they were within us.\" When the couple did open the gift, they found items like wine glasses and notes/money for Kathy and for Brandon. Brandon’s note told him to use his money to buy flowers and wine. Kathy’s note told her to buy pizza and get a bath ready. \"All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies,\" the post says. \"After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" – and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all.\"\n",

            "Topic: 12 Weather And Climate Concepts That Confuse The Public\n",
            "Paragraph: I was the keynote speaker at Georgia State University recently. During that talk, I spoke about a few concepts that are often counterintuitive or confusing to the public. Since I wrote this 12 days into December, let's explain 12 weather and climate concepts that can understandably be tricky if you are not trained as a meteorologist or climatologist. 1. Moist air is less dense than dry air. If you live in Texas or parts of Plains, you may be familiar with the dryline. It is a boundary that represents a difference between relatively dry and moist air. Moist air (less dense) can be lifted along the dryline to initiate storms. Wait, shouldn't air with moisture in it be more dense? Moist air is actually less dense because for a given volume, water vapor has a molecular weight of about 18 grams per mole (atomic units) whereas dry air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) has a molecular weight of 28.97 grams per mole. So when you add moisture to a volume, you are lowering the density. Feel free to review Avogadro's Law if you have a headache by now (smile). 2. It is dangerous to take shelter under the tallest trees during lightning but people do it anyhow. The tree serves as a natural lightning rods. This illustration by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). 3. It is very dangerous to shelter under a bridge overpass if you are trying to avoid a tornado. The Venturi Effect (describe in detail here) explains how a fluid's velocity increases when it flows through a contracted channel or tube. The overpass provides an opportunity for the violent wind flow in a tornado to be constricted and perhaps accelerated. 4. Lightning associated with a thunderstorm is not spelled with an e. Full disclosure: I just threw that in because it is a pet-peeve. 5. As long as we are getting my pet peeves out of the way, heat lightning is not a thing and it is not caused by the heat of the day. Here is a great explanation by The Weather Channel. 6. Some deserts are inherently cold. The American Meteorological Society's Glossary of Meteorology defines a desert as a region where precipitation is insufficient to support any except xerophilous (drought resistant) vegetation. Parts of Greenland are considered a desert. Here is a list of the 10 coldest deserts on Earth. 7. Even hot deserts can get cold. During the day, the sun heats up deserts that are traditionally thought of as hot. During the evening hours, longwave infrared energy (heat) is radiated outward and the temperature may drop. For example, in the Sahara Desert, the temperature range from high to low can be as large as 70 degrees Fahrenheit at certain times of the year. 8. A cold day or snowy day provides no guidance on broader climate. Day-to-day or even week-to-week weather patterns don't provide any information on climate or its changes. Climate is defined as the statistical properties of atmospheric variables and processes. Your mood today doesn't tell me anything, necessarily, about your personality. If you don't like the weather, wait a few hours or a day. If you don't like the climate, Move--Scott Denning, CSU Professor 9. Even as our climate continues to warm in part due to human activities, we will still have winter. In the year 2080, the climate state of Earth is likely to be warmer, but we will still have cold seasons. The seasons are dictated by the Earth's axial tilt and its revolution around the Sun. So yes, even in a warmer climate, we will have winter storms, blizzards and cold days. 10. Yes, a tiny amount of carbon dioxide can have a big difference in our atmosphere. As Colorado State University Professor Scott Denning once said, The fact that we survive night proves that the Greenhouse Effect is real. Without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it would be likely be too cold for us at certain times of the year. Yet, I often see people use the rationale that the relatively small amount of greenhouse gases can't possibly matter in regulating or warming our climate. Ummm, yep it does, and we have understood this for many, many decades. Established atmospheric physics theory often reaching back to Callendar (1938) and others has clearly explained this process. Recently, I learned of Eunice Foote, a woman often ignored, who is now credited with identifying the Greenhouse Effect in the 1850s. If you struggle with the concept, remember it only takes a small amount of a Black Mamba's venom to be deadly. By the way, I often see a misunderstanding of the net contributors to our climate. People see the big bright sun and mischaracterize its role. Since most people will never take a Radiative Transfer or Atmospheric Physics course, this little primer in Bloomberg is quite good. 11. A strong polar vortex actually hinders cold air outbreaks. As I wrote previously in Forbes, Ironically and counterintuitive to many, the strong Polar Vortex can be linked, in part, to warmer temperatures. When the Polar Vortex is strong, Arctic air cannot escape the fence and ooze its way down into the United States. I say ooze because cold air is dense relative to warm air. If the Polar Vortex weakens, the cold air can more easily penetrate into the lower 48 states. The last couple of years the Polar Vortex has weakened, and we saw the influx of cold air into the Northern Hemisphere. If the Vortx splits, you also maximize snow potential too. 12. Most people think that tornadoes, hurricanes or lightning kill more people in the United States per year. According to 30 year National Weather Service averages, it is heat and flooding. When you factor in indirect fatalities (cold weather traffic accidents, heart attacks, and so forth), the metric of extreme temperature may be a better descriptor. This surprises people because you rarely see a TV station send a reporter to cover a heat wave or chaser convergence on a flood. By the way, emoji weather forecasts on your phone App still have challenges (though ubiquitous now) and people still struggle with the concept of % chance of rain, but I have written about those things before so I left them off of this list.\n",

            "Paragraph: Violence against women continues to be a serious threat in our society. I have two daughters who are young adults, and concern about their safety is always in the back of my mind, particularly when they are out on city streets at night. College campuses throughout this country, also continue to present a high risk for women being victimized, by violent attacks and/or sexual assaults. An astounding statistic for \"forcible sex offenses\" at large universities was reported by the Boston Globe; between 2012 and 2013 sexual assaults had increased by 40%. That’s the bad news, but the video you are about to watch below, offers some incredibly good news. Yasmin Mustafa and Anthony Gold founded a company, ROAR, whose chief goal was to stop violence against women by arming them...and not with a gun. Women have carried MACE, worn whistles around their neck etc., with little impact on fighting off attackers. ROAR designed an emergency alert device with a fashionable edge, which they named Athena, a nod to the Greek goddess of justice and strength. Their goal was to empower women, so they could have the freedom to navigate the world without fear. Wearing this device as a necklace, instills the confidence that they are never alone. Athena is worn like a pendant around the neck; three seconds of holding down the button on it sounds a loud alarm. At the same time, loved ones and friends receive text messages alerting them of the woman’s location, and sends a 1-click call to 911! The emergency contacts not only get the location but can dial the woman or 911 with one click. Hats off to ROAR! This device, as you will see in the upcoming footage, is going a long way towards creating a society where women will no longer have to walk in fear. They recommend it for girls from middle school and up. As you will see, Athena is the size of a quarter and is quite attractive. I have bought one for each of my daughters. Let us know what you think about this invention.\n",

The group asked the Queen, who was wearing a headscarf and tweed coat, if she lived in the area, to which she responded simply by saying she had a house close-by.  \"Have you ever met the Queen?\" they asked. \"No,\" she apparently replied, before pointing at the policeman and adding: \"But he has.\" The group were still none the wiser and left without realising whose company they had just shared.  Balmoral Castle and Estate was purchased by Queen Victoria and passed down to members of the Royal family. The grounds are opened to the public from May to July each year.  A spokesperson for Kensington Palace told the Independent Mr Griffin worked closely with the Queen as a protection officer for over 30 years. \n",

            "Paragraph: Binding politicians, hexing fascists, looking out for humanity and causing trouble: All in a day's work for modern, politically-organized witches.  Witches and the witch-curious caught global attention after announcing they would come together online to cast \"a spell to bind U.S. President Donald Trump and all those who abet him\" last month. (Though that hasn't stopped his flurry of controversial executive orders that have rocked the globe.)  Still, for these internet-savvy witches, one little spell designed to stop someone from doing harm is just the beginning of their plans for political change. Anyone who watched The Craft in the '90s will be familiar with the concept of a binding spell — you probably attempted one in high school after trying to make a friend levitate with light as a feather, stiff as a board. Ideally, the spell to bind Trump would have caused a magically-influenced change of heart and cosmic protection for the downtrodden — and the planet itself.  SEE ALSO: Lana Del Ray calls upon fellow witches to cast spell on Donald Trump Farfetched? Maybe. But this is a long game. As one anonymous group of web-based witches, the Yerbamala Collective, says of their resistance, \"Yerba mala nunca muere.\" Translation: A bad weed never dies.    English occultist Aleister Crowley, in the book Magick and Theory and Practice, defines a witch as someone who believes in and practices magic, or \"the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.\"  If that sounds somewhat political, that's because it is: In 1941, for example, witches gathered to \"hex Hitler.\" Later, in 1967, Beat poet Allan Ginsberg and friends \"exorcised\" the Pentagon. For some who consider themselves witches, to resist is to build spiritual strength and compassion through ritual and discussion. For others, it's about spells cast in private. For still others, the revolution starts with disseminating anti-fascist poetry and casting spells en masse. Old-school methods of street-stomping protests, too, are getting re-witchified.

Spend a bit of time on Tumblr or Etsy too and you'll see signs of the cultural proliferation of witchcraft everywhere. Not to mention the cultural dominance of Harry Potter. Trend forecasters K Hole (responsible for identifying \"norm core\") published a \"Report on Doubt\" last year, which identified a general mystical trend articulating the current culture's obsession with faith, doubt and a desire to predict the future.

For members of W.I.T.C.H, anonymity is a security concern as much as a symbolic statement of subversive power. \"The internet ... is making it easier to reach large audiences but also potentially more dangerous for feminists who get a lot of attention online.

Judging from the witch-themed placards that popped up on Instagram and Twitter during the Women's March, it's an enjoyable in-joke that celebrates female power at the very least.  At most?

            "Paragraph: Gwyneth Paltrow gets a lot of flak for running a small empire by the name of Goop, which includes a website where she curates content on how to live your best life and sells luxury items that not many people can afford to purchase. But in spite of the actress-turned-wellness mogul's seemingly perfect lifestyle, she doesn't shy away from keeping it real, especially when discussing the fine lines on her face that become more obvious while laughing. \"First of all, I love getting older,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"I so value the life experience under my belt and my wrinkles come with that. I would never want to go back in time.\" Terry Wyatt via Getty Images Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow is embracing aging with a positive and real outlook. The 43-year-old does want to \"preserve [the] things she can\" so she doesn't have to \"start cutting into her face.\" So it makes total sense that she'd invest all her energy and expertise into launching an organic skincare line called Goop by Juice Beauty. After learning about the toxic ingredients found in countless cosmetics, Paltrow revealed she didn't rest until she and her team of chemists were able to formulate quality skincare that could end the stigma surrounding organic beauty products only being for hippies. \"We're here to change that and say that the modern, sophisticated woman who has a very high standard in skincare also deserves a product that is as good for the body as it is for the skin,\" she said. Paltrow went on to explain how she's had friends who've struggled with fertility. \"There are so many things in personal skincare products that are endocrine disruptor agents. We want balanced hormones, we want to be fertile, and then we're imbibing all of these toxins that are throwing off our natural hormonal system. Who's to say it is link or not linked, but it certainly doesn't point to a good direction,\" she said. The six-piece line -- which includes a cleanser, scrub, daytime moisturizer, night cream, face oil and eye cream -- is formulated with skin-nourishing oils that soothe and brighten dull, dry complexions, food-grade preservatives (which Jimmy Fallon put to a taste test) and plant-based cellulose beads that gently remove dead skin cells. As a self-professed lover of facial oils, Paltrow made sure to round out the collection with an enriching face oil.

Frank Spadafora, a former casting director and the founder and CEO of an app that ranks the power of models called D'Marie Archive, told CR Fashion Book that, \"the three most highly ranked supers on social - Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevigne, and Gigi Hadid, in descending order, are currently valued between $125,000 and $300,000 for a single post across their portfolio\". Even models, who don't have tens of millions of followers, are taking home a nice chunk of change for each sponsored post on social media. \"The next tier, very familiar faces like Karlie Kloss, Behati Prinsloo, and Miranda Kerr, can command between $25,000 to $50,000 for a single post across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram,\" Frank Spadafora adds. Social media presence and how many followers a particular model has is crucial, when it comes to how likely a model is to be hired. Jennifer Powell of Next Models told CR Fashion Book, \"For sure, casting directors will ask for models with over 'X' amount of followers, and then will ask for the specs of the talent after that.\" Of course, this doesn't mean everything they post is paid for. They could also be posting images plugging a certain brand for free simply because they like the photo or the product.

            "Paragraph: New research from Consumer Reports shows that pregnant women should avoid all tuna, contrary to the Food and Drug Administration's description of light canned tuna as a fish \"lower in mercury.\" \"Tuna happens to be one of the fish that can be very high in mercury, and some types of tuna have higher levels than others,\" Jean Halloran, Director of Food Policy Initiative at Consumer Reports told The Huffington Post. \"The type that tends to get used in sushi is often very high, but even canned light tuna, which tends to average pretty low levels and is generally one of the safer fish to eat, occasionally has these spikes of high levels of mercury.\" Because pregnant woman can't tell which individual cans may have higher levels of tuna, Consumer Reports recommends that pregnant women simply skip all tuna throughout their entire pregnancy. The findings were published online Thursday on online and will appear in the Oct. 2014 issue of the nonprofit's magazine, Consumer Reports. The FDA's advice on light canned tuna is from 2004, and the federal agency is poised to overhaul all its advice on seafood consumption soon, reports the Wall Street Journal. But a draft of the new recommendations, subject to final approval, still lists light canned tuna as a low-mercury fish for vulnerable groups. Seafood contains nutrients like protein, iron and omega-3 fatty acids, which are especially vital for the growth and brain development of fetuses, breastfeeding babies and young children. But certain kinds of seafood, especially larger fish, can contain a neurotoxin called methylmercury (commonly referred to as simply \"mercury\") that can cause severe birth defects like blindness, deafness and mental retardation if fetuses are exposed to the metal in utero. Canned tuna was once the most widely-consumed type of seafood in the U.S., and in 2012 still came in second, after shrimp. Despite the rankings, all canned seafood, of which tuna is the leader, dropped to its lowest level in more than 15 years, reports the Washington Post -- perhaps because of health concerns like mercury. Currently, the FDA recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children also stay away from shark, swordfish, king mackarel and tilefish -- recommendations that Consumer Reports agrees with. But when it comes to the FDA's recommendations of which seafood those groups should eat, the government agency stops short of a comprehensive list, save these suggestions: salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish, cod and light canned tuna, about two to three times a week. To give people a wider selection of low-mercury seafood, CR took the Environmental Protection Agency's data on the average amount of mercury per fish and listed them into two groups: \"Lowest\" mercury and \"Lower\" mercury as part of their report. \"The best fish on the list is salmon,\" said Halloran. \"Virtually all the canned salmon in stores is wild Alaskan salmon, and it's a very good substitute for canned tuna -- it's just a little more work, because you have to take the bones out.\" To see Consumer Report's list of the 17 best seafoods with low mercury levels, check out the slideshow below.

            "Paragraph: When you have very little resources available, which was undoubtedly the case for many American families during the economic depression of the 1930s, you have to get creative to meet your needs. According to a Mental Floss article inspired by the new book, A Square Meal: A Culinary History of the Great Depression, there were lots of unconventional ways people went about putting food on the table. In addition to homegrown fruits and vegetables, inexpensive ingredients like canned beef, hot dogs, pasta, and potatoes were everyday staples. Woman picking tomatoes in California, November 1938. Getty Images \"My father used to buy a sack of potatoes and we ate potatoes every day. Potatoes with pasta, potatoes fried, potatoes with eggs,\" said the late Clara Cannucciari, host of the web series Cooking with Clara, during a video tutorial on how to make the Depression-era dish Poor Man's Meal. \"I had to quit high school because I couldn't afford socks, I couldn't afford anything to wear. But we survived,\" she added. Most Popular Perhaps even more shocking than the thought of someone ending their formal education for want of socks is the notion that a meal made mostly of corned beef and gelatin was popular back in the day. \"In the 1930s, gelatin was considered a modern, cutting edge food,\" writes Rudie Obias at Mental Floss. Back then, people apparently enjoyed a food called Corned Beef Luncheon Salad, a mix of canned corned beef, plain gelatin, canned peas, vinegar, lemon juice, and, sometimes, if you were lucky, cabbage. Simple, yes, but was it delicious? Andy Coe, co-author of A Square Meal, calls the recipe \"wrong in every possible way.\" Yet, somehow, the recipe stuck around until at least the 1960s, as evidenced by this delightful vintage cookbook page shared over at Mid-Century Menu (the recipe's there as well, if you feel so inclined): Midcentury Menu/Retro Ruth Sorry, great-grandparents, but we won't be attempting this one anytime soon.

            "Paragraph: This just in: You CAN make something from nothing. Earlier this year, a Canadian nonprofit called Sole Food Street Farms took an old gas station and turned it into the largest urban orchard in North America. Sole Food transforms vacant spaces into sources of sustenance and livelihood for the Vancouver community. \"We believe healthy food systems foster healthy communities,\" their website states. \"We envision a future where good food is accessible and grown sustainably, where farms thrive in an urban setting and where the community comes together to connect directly with their food and their neighbors.\" Its newest farm was previously a Petro-Canada gas station in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, an area known as Canada's poorest postal code, according to Fast Company. Sole Foods reopened the site as an urban garden in July, and the formerly vacant lot now has 500 fruit trees that will go a long way toward producing the 60 tons of fresh produce that Sole Foods expects to net this year between its four existing sites. In addition to producing artisan quality fruits and vegetables for local markets and restaurants, Sole Foods aims to employ nontraditional farmers -- individuals, for example, who may have struggled with addiction or mental illness and are looking for ways to turn their lives around. \"This is a production model,\" co-founder Michael Ableman told Global News. \"It’s designed to produce production quantities of food and jobs, two of our primary goals.\" Sounds like a win, win to us.

            "Paragraph: Q. I know it’s not good to eat close to bedtime, but I get hungry. What are the least harmful things I can eat — or drink — say, an hour or two before going to bed? A. It’s hard to resist late-night cravings, but try to limit your bedtime nosh to 100 or 200 calories, 300 calories tops, said Isabel Maples, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and choose nutrient-rich items that may be lacking in your diet, like fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, whole grains or nuts, \"to really make those calories count.\" (Seafood and beans are other good options, but not particularly appealing before bed.) Keep in mind that snacking contributes to weight gain, and studies have found that nearly one-quarter of the calories we eat come from snacks. A banana, apple or other fresh fruit, a small portion of low-fat cottage cheese or plain yogurt with sliced fruit, or oatmeal or some other high-fiber cereal with skim milk were frequent suggestions made by experts interviewed for this article. Other suggestions included raw veggie sticks, a couple of whole grain crackers with a small slice of cheese, a handful of almonds or other nuts, or celery sticks spread with a tablespoon or two of peanut butter or almond butter (measure the nuts and butters — don’t eat them straight out of the container). Combining carbohydrates with protein produces a filling, sating feeling, even from a small snack, Ms. Maples said. If you’re in the mood for something salty and crunchy, air-popped popcorn may fit the bill, suggested Laura Smith, a product manager for Weight Watchers. It’s important to note that many people become hungry at night because \"they eat too little during the day, and then by the time they get home, they can’t stop, because they have built up a huge reservoir of starving inside,\" said Susan B. Roberts, a senior scientist and professor at the U.S.D.A. Nutrition Center at Tufts University, and founder of the online iDiet weight management program. For others, she said, snacking before bed may just be a bad habit. Also ask yourself: Are you really hungry? People often mistake thirst for hunger. Try drinking more throughout the day, and having more water or carbonated water with dinner. Before bed, try a glass of low-fat milk, hot or cold, noncaffeinated tea or, best of all, plain old water. \"Drinking water is clearly the least harmful item to have before bed,\" said Barry Popkin, a professor at the U.N.C. Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n",

            "Topic: 10 Reasons Why Big Cats Are Really Just Overgrown House Cats\n",
            "Paragraph: It might be hard to compare wild cats stalking their prey on the Serengeti with the smaller ball of fur that rests comfortably on your laptop keyboard, but wild big cats and smaller house cats have much more in common than you would think. They’re all belong to the family felidae, and when you get to the family level of taxonomy, the species are going to be pretty similar in behavior, if not necessarily in appearance. Here are ten behaviors that run constant through cats of all types, big and small. How They Play What humans would take as fighting, or, at the very least, wrestling, cats find all in good fun. Big or small, they like to get a workout and interact by rolling around and pawing at their peers. It rarely turns violent when this is the intent, and actually is most common around lions, the most social of any cat species. 2. How They Rest Cats of all sizes and walks of life love their sleep. The lazy beasts get in 16 to 20 hours of shut eye and lounging per day and with it comes a lot of yawns. Hunting takes a lot of energy for any animal, and even housecats have that need to sleep in hardwired in their DNA. 3. How They Clean Themselves All cats groom themselves to stay clean, using their rough tongue to course through their fur. And cheetahs, like house cats, tend to purr when cleaning themselves, whereas the other big cats are a little stoic when practicing their hygiene. 4. How Moody They Get Cats are fickle animals across the board, as most human owners can attest. They get downright mean without much instigation. Panthers are the most temperamental of the bunch, possibly due to their high rate of inbreeding. 5. How They Scratch Scratching posts aren’t just an idle activity for cats — they serve a practical function. Cats of all sizes have the genetics of hunting machines, and they need to keep their claws sharp. Scratching stuff helps them achieve this. They also are very agile, reactive animals, and scratching stretches out their muscles for when it’s game time. 6. How Territorial They Get Again, cats are almost uniformly predators, and if things get a little crowded, they tend to lash out to maintain their own space, despite being social animals. Pumas exhibit this trait the most, and as a result occupy the largest territory of any wild cat. Your house cat could exercise the same behavior in closer quarters. 7. How They Smell House cats spend a lot of time with their mouths open, and they’re not constantly in awe, they’re actually smelling. All cats further flex their sense of smell by opening their mouths, in keeping with their nature as wild hunters. 8. How They Climb Cats like to be up high, and, yet again, it comes back to their nature as hunters. A high perch serves to increase field of vision, and also remain hidden from prey. That instinct hasn’t left many domestic cats, which is why you’ll often find them perched up high in a room or in a nearby tree. 9. How They Hunt House cats are hunters, make no mistake. You’ve seen Tom and Jerry, right? That’s grounded in fact. Okay, that might not be true, but domestic cats hunt what they can, and that includes local birds and rodents, just like their wild brethren. 10. How They Show Affection Big cats and small cats often exhibit a familiar family dynamic, with the male serving as the protector and the mother serving as the caregiver. This instinct doesn’t disappear when the animals are kept as solitary pets – it just lies dormant.\n",

            "Paragraph: Nobody really wants to their girls to sag. Yes, it’s an inevitable side effect of aging, but we’d like to put that off as long as possible. Like, really though. There’s nothing wrong with wanting perky boobs that sit up nicely and make us feel confident. It’s our body and our decision so why not feel good about it? Aside from appearances, proper breast care is extremely important to our health. There are many factors that come to play when getting your girls in shape and it’s good to be informed. Even the slightest lifestyle changes can make the biggest difference. Knowledge is power people, or in this case knowledge is perky tits. See Also: 24 Tweets About Boobs Guaranteed To Make You Laugh Your Boobs Off Why do they sag? Breasts do not have muscle, they are made of fat, connective tissues and milk-producing glands, for anyone who has never had an anatomy class in their life. According to various studies , when a woman reaches her late thirties, her skin can become loose and begin to show signs of aging. This is especially true in the breasts, particularly if a woman has gone through a pregnancy. However age and pregnancy aren’t the only factors that cause sagging. There’s multiple reasons that your fun bags can start drooping. Don’t Smoke Obviously, smoking is no good for any part of your body. Not only is it going to destroy your lungs, but studies prove that Tobacco damages skin collagen and elastin, which leads to premature wrinkling and sagging. Not cute. Make your D.A.R.E. officer proud and just say no. Avoid Over-Tanning And Excess Sun Exposure Excess sun exposure xcess sun exposure damages the skin particularly in our more sensitive areas. If you’ve ever been to Europe or gone topless on any beach without sunscreen, you know that nipple sunburns are a cruel punishment. Aside from the discomfort, your skin gets thinner and you end up with more creasing and wrinkles over the years. No thank you. Make Sure Your Bras Fit Properly Seriously though, bras that don’t allow your girls sit correctly or don’t give them any support at all are a big no-no. While bras won’t keep your boobs from sagging, well-fitted ones can reduce pain when exercising and improve posture. Not to mention, they’ll turn a few more heads. Be Mindful Of Your Posture In the words of Princess Diaries,\"don’t shlump!\" Most people have a habit of hunching over and rounding their shoulders especially when on the computer. This tends to make breasts look lower and heavier. Remind yourself to sit/stand up straight. You’ll be surprised at the difference it can make. Maintain A Steady Weight According to the Science Of Eating , gaining and losing weight continuously or failing to stay at a steady optimal weight, can take a toll on your breasts. Your skin loses elasticity when stretched. When you lose weight, you can lose fat from the breasts very fast as compared to other parts of the body. This continuous stretching and relaxing of the skin makes it droop and sag over time. So basically be consistent. If you’re going for that summer bod commit to it! Get Physical Exercising is always a good idea. While your breasts are not made up of muscle, certain exercises can improve the appearance of your pectoral area by strengthening surrounding ligaments, which may make them appear more lively. Girl, you better work. Lube Up With Aloe Vera Aloe Vera possesses natural skin-tightening properties that can help get rid of sagging breasts. The antioxidants in the plant also prevent damage caused by free radicals and help firm sagging breasts. So get our your Aloe and lube up! Give Yourself A Massage Massage your breasts at least 2-3 times per week with coconut or olive oil to help add firmness and increase the elasticity to the skin as well as improve the skin tone and texture. Using ice with your massage can also help tone the skin in and around the breast region. Think like that scene from 50 Shades except not quite as kinky, unless you’re feelin’ some type of way. Drink Water And Lots Of It According to experts at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals , the skin is comprised of cells that are predominantly made up of water. Lack of water takes a toll on the skin, and can make the skin over your breast look shrunken and dull.This could lead to premature aging of the skin around the breasts making it lose firmness and sag. Get that thirst quenched. Own What You Got At the end of the day the only opinion that really matters about your body is your own. So love the skin your in and take care of yourself.

            "Topic: Teachers are leaving the profession in their droves – and little wonder. Who would want to be one in modern Britain?\n",
            "Paragraph: Teachers aren’t uniquely sensitive creatures; they are experts in their field and, by voting with their feet and leaving their vocation, they are sending a warning to the Government that something is seriously wrong Schools are reaching a crisis point. By 2025 there will be 3 million pupils of secondary school age, but not enough young people are choosing to become teachers themselves. Teacher training places are going unfilled. Early last September, half of places on some such courses were sitting empty with just days to go before classes began. Government recruitment targets have been missed in the majority of subjects, including physics (by 19 per cent) and mathematics (by 16 per cent). Design and Technology only reached 41 per cent of its recruitment target this year. Meanwhile we’re shedding existing teachers from our schools at record rates: 10,000 departed the profession between 2010 and 2015, and the pace of that loss is speeding up as disillusionment grows. Another £3bn cut to budgets is anticipated in the coming years – likely to be confirmed in Philip Hammond’s Budget next month – meaning that spending will reduce by 8 per cent per secondary pupil within the next three years. In short, there simply aren’t enough teachers to educate our young people and it’s a crisis that is entirely politically manufactured. Three years ago, half of teachers said they were considering leaving the profession. At that point, as well as dealing with a spiralling workload, they were also being insulted each morning on the radio, in the press or in parliament by the then Education Secretary Michael Gove. The very man who should have been fighting their corner in an age of cutbacks instead spent his days inventing some very creative names for teachers: \"the blob\", the \"enemies of promise\", \"soft bigots\" with \"low expectations\". Gove was later replaced by Nicky Morgan, who, instead of repairing fractured relations, sought to rub salt into the glistening wounds. She accused teachers of \"doing battle\" unnecessarily with the Government and \"doing down the profession they represent in the process\". And, when similar research was carried out last year, nothing had improved. MPs picked apart the result of all this mud-slinging this week: \"As the population grows, efforts to recruit and retain good quality teachers become even more critical,\" they warned. \"While recruiting sufficient new teachers is, of course, necessary, the Government should place greater emphasis on improving teacher retention ... Not only is this a more cost-effective way to tackle some of the issues, but more teachers staying in the profession for longer would strengthen the pool of leadership positions.\" But why would anyone want to put in the hours (60+ per week, of which less than half is actually spent in the classroom teaching children) to build their career to leadership level when the Government pig-headedly refuses to do the one thing that would actually help solve this problem: listen to teachers, and acknowledge what they are saying? Teachers aren’t uniquely sensitive creatures; they are experts in their field and, by voting with their feet and leaving their vocation, they are sending a warning to the Government that something is seriously wrong. And it’s easy to discover what, because they have been talking about it openly for years. First, there’s the unreasonable workload. That, as teachers themselves have pointed out, is not exclusive to their profession. However, in teaching, the weight of the workload is compounded by data-gathering, form-filling, or any of the other myriad examples of endless bureaucracy that the Government requires in their futile efforts to continuously compare one school with another. Then there’s the apparent ignorance from the Government of what teachers are actually trying to achieve. As one former teacher, Zoe Brown, who quit last year, told The Independent: \"In some ways I don’t feel like a teacher at all anymore. I prepare children for tests and, if I’m honest, I do it quite well. It’s not something I’m particularly proud of, as it’s not as if I have provided my class with any transferable, real-life skills during the process. They’ve not enjoyed it, I’ve not enjoyed it, but we’ve done it: one thing my children know how to do is answer test questions.\" On top of that, there are ideological concerns for some about the forced academisation programme, which gives businesses influence over young people; the truly chilling effect of year-on-year pay freezes (the clue’s in the name); and an enforced increase in employee contributions to pension plans which make even experienced teachers worse off year-by-year. Little wonder they are looking for alternatives in the jobs market. Of course, not all teachers who are considering leaving within the next five years will go through with that threat. \"Considering leaving\" teaching may also mean weighing up the remaining benefits against the drawbacks of starting over in another line of work. The pay in teaching may not seem competitive when compared to other graduate roles, but the 12 weeks’ paid holiday a year is some recompense; it may sound like a virtual nirvana for others trapped in an unfulfilling role with just quarter of that annual allowance of time to oneself. Yet the MPs are right to set off a flare: with Brexit fast approaching, immigration can no longer be relied upon to fill teaching gaps. Important subjects such as technology and the sciences are being neglected in our schools as specialist teaching posts sit vacant – many in the very disciplines that will create the jobs of the future, in a high-tech economy. Ministers play fast and loose with the carrots – attractive bursaries to train, higher pay and debt write-offs for new teachers entering in-demand subjects – while appearing oblivious to all the sticks they are throwing at the same time. Teaching must be made more attractive. MPs have some interesting ideas on how to achieve this, such as capping the number of hours outside the classroom that teachers are expected to work, but there’s no need for complicated brainstorming sessions. The simplest thing that the Government could do to make education a more enticing career is to simply open their ears.\n",

            "Paragraph: (CNN)This is the story of a little PO box in Northern Virginia and the conspiracy that wasn't. When the Republican presidential primary was still in full swing in March, officials from Donald Trump's campaign promoted a conspiracy theory -- one of many -- insisting there was a nefarious link between his political opponents and an anti-Trump super PAC.  It began this spring when a group called Make America Awesome, an anti-Trump group, posted a photo of Trump's wife, Melania, that criticized her for posing semi-nude in a magazine photo shoot. Trump responded by crudely lambasting the physical appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and he justified it by claiming that Cruz was behind the attack on his own wife.  As evidence, Trump's team pointed to a large donation that Carly Fiorina's super PAC received from a pro-Cruz super PAC. And Fiorina's super PAC, they noted, had the same mailing address as Make America Awesome, the group that had attacked Trump's wife. Because those groups listed the same address, they claimed it was proof that the anti-Trump forces were operating from the same source.  Trump's supporters, including his campaign's social media director, Daniel Scavino, lit up the Internet with screenshots showing the identical address: PO BOX 26141 in Alexandria, Virginia. Trump-friendly websites wrote about it as though it was evidence of a vast conspiracy against the Republican frontrunner.  CNN traced the address to a PO Box owned by Christopher Marston, an attorney who specializes in campaign finance compliance. It turns out that same address serves as the official \"address\" of dozens of campaigns.  So why would several groups all have the same address? The answer is not nearly as titillating: Marston's business, Election CFO, contracts with dozens of campaigns and political action committees to provide services that including filling out their financial paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and handle accounting. It's a common practice for political groups to contract out such work to experts trained in navigating the complicated campaign finance regulations. \"People just hire me to be their treasurer,\" Marston told CNN in an interview at his home office in Alexandria. \"I do accounting. Honest to goodness I really just write the checks and make the deposits.\" Despite his paper trail affiliation with campaigns and PACs, Marston's role is almost exclusively clerical. His little PO Box isn't the hub for GOP conspiracy meetings and he doesn't involve himself with campaign strategy, messaging or opposition research.  \"My interaction to those folks is mostly limited to paying their invoices,\" he said.  There are many such companies who provide similar services for both Republicans and Democrats.  \"It's not a conspiracy,\" Marston said.\n",

            "Paragraph: As you may have heard by now, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will enter the general election as the two most disliked major presidential candidates in modern history. But just what effect will that have on voters? A new Reuters/Ipsos survey shines some light on the answer, and it's not pretty: Nearly half of both Trump and Clinton supporters say their primary motivation isn't putting their preferred candidate in the White House — it's keeping the other one out of it. While the percentages are roughly comparable, that doesn't mean the number of people planning to vote against Clinton (as opposed to voting for Trump) is the same as the number who plan to vote against Trump (as opposed to voting for Clinton). Hillary leads in a still-technically hypothetical general election matchup with the celebrity billionaire by about 9 points in Reuters' tracking poll, suggesting there are considerably more not-him voters out there than not-her ones at the moment — something that makes sense given that for all of Clinton's many problems, she's not a dangerously unstable demagogue who wears a gold-plated fig leaf emblazoned with the words \"unpredictability\" and \"winner\" on it. Still, the sizes of both of those numbers are striking. To be fair, the general dislike of both candidates can be explained partly by negative partisanship, which has been increasing for some time. In 2014, Pew researchers found that over the past two decades the share of both Republicans and Democrats who have a very unfavorable opinion of the other party has more than doubled (from 17 percent to 43 percent for Republicans, and from 16 percent to 38 percent for Democrats). And those numbers understate just how passionately those intense partisans feel about the opposing side. Among those who stated a very unfavorable opinion, a clear majority said that the other party is a \"threat to the nation's well being.\" If you think that, it's easy to see why you would be more fearful of the other party's nominee than you are hopeful about your own. Still, that the current state of electoral politics — as polarized as they are — doesn't entirely explain just how unpopular Trump and Clinton are among voters right now. If it did, you'd expect the number of Americans who strongly dislike him or her to largely be offset by a corresponding number of those who strongly like him or her. But, as FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten demonstrated, that's not the case. Since 1980, even the most unpopular nominees didn't head into the general election with a net-strong favorability rating — that is, the percentage with a \"strongly favorable\" minus the percentage with a \"strongly unfavorable\" one — below negative-10. Clinton's, though, is currently roughly twice that, while Trump's is more than four times it. (Hillary should thank the electoral heavens every morning that she's up against someone who cancels out so many of her weaknesses.) It also stands to reason that the ranks of both competing oh-good-god-anybody-but-him/her camps will grow during the six long and nasty months between now and Election Day. Those anti-Trump primary voters who end up voting Republican in November anyway will almost certainly do it to keep Clinton out of the White House. Similarly, many of the Bernie Sanders diehards who ultimately come around to Hillary will probably do so first and foremost in the name of stopping the Donald. A contest between two candidates who are so disliked, then, could come down to which one can do a better job of convincing Americans of the dangers of their rival. On that front, Hillary seems to have a sizeable head start. © 2016 Slate\n",

A post shared by Sarah Brown (@sarahmb15) on Oct 30, 2015 at 5:55pm PDT \"Tough little lady\" Abigail Ann Brown was born March 4, and Brown, now a breastfeeding mother of a four-month-old, competes in the first round of the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials in the 1500m race in Eugene, Oregon, Thursday. Brown documented her training during her pregnancy on her blog as well as her social media accounts. She and her family are living in her parents’ basement apartment in Warrenton, Virginia, so they can have extra help with the baby while Brown trains. Though she never gave up her training — taking just a week off from exercise when she gave birth under her doctor's supervision — Brown has also been savoring her moments with her newborn while on the road to Rio. Before Abigail was born, Brown wrote a letter to her on her blog. \"My quest to continue training for the Olympic Trials will never compare to the continuous quest I will be on to be the best mother for you,\" she wrote. Like any new mother, Brown is learning how to adapt to her new life; she’s just figuring out sleep schedules and breastfeeding in between workouts and foam rolling. In one Instagram post, she used the hashtag #Mommyintraining — \"double meaning intended,\" she added. Brown joins other new moms and elite runners like Clara Peterson and fellow Olympic hopeful Stephanie Rothstein Bruce, determined to show the world just how strong mothers are. #Mommyintraining - double meaning intended ☺️ #newmom #babygirl #trio2rio #trainingpartner A post shared by Sarah Brown (@sarahmb15) on Apr 15, 2016 at 9:44am PDT\n",
